    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nIntroduction\nWarner Music Group Corp. (the Company) was formed on November 21, 2003. We are the direct parent of WMG Holdings Corp. (Holdings), which is the direct parent of WMG Acquisition Corp. (Acquisition Corp.). Acquisition Corp. is one of the worlds major music entertainment companies.\nThe Company and Holdings are holding companies that conduct substantially all of their business operations through their subsidiaries. The terms we, us, our, ours and the Company refer collectively to Warner Music Group Corp. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context refers only to Warner Music Group Corp. as a corporate entity.\nAcquisition of Warner Music Group by Access Industries\nPursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 6, 2011 (the Merger Agreement), by and among the Company, AI Entertainment Holdings LLC (formerly Airplanes Music LLC), a Delaware limited liability company (Parent) and an affiliate of Access Industries, Inc., and Airplanes Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (Merger Sub), on July 20, 2011 (the Merger Closing Date), Merger Sub merged with and into the Company with the Company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the Merger). In connection with the Merger, the Company delisted its common stock from the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE).\nInitial Public Offering\nOn June 5, 2020, the Company went public again and completed an initial public offering (IPO) of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.001 per share (Class A Common Stock). The Company listed its shares on the NASDAQ stock market under the ticker symbol WMG. The offering consisted entirely of secondary shares sold by Access Industries, LLC (collectively with its affiliates, Access) and certain related selling stockholders.\nFollowing the completion of the IPO, Access and its affiliates continue to hold all of the Class B common stock of the Company, par value $0.001 per share (Class B Common Stock), representing approximately 98% of the total combined voting power of the Companys outstanding common stock and approximately 73% of the economic interest. As a result, the Company is a controlled company within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of NASDAQ. See ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report, certain risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. The risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not currently know about or that we currently believe are immaterial may also adversely impact our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. This Annual Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements following this Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nWe may be unable to compete successfully in the highly competitive markets in which we operate, and we may suffer reduced profits as a result.\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive, have experienced ongoing consolidation among major music entertainment companies and are driven by consumer preferences that are rapidly changing. Additionally, they require substantial human and capital resources. We compete with other recorded music companies and music publishing companies to identify and sign new recording artists and songwriters with the potential to achieve long-term success and to enter into and renew agreements with established recording artists and songwriters. In addition, our competitors may from time to time increase the amounts they spend to discover, or to market and promote, recording artists and songwriters or reduce the prices of their music in an effort to expand market share. We may lose business if we are unable to sign successful recording artists or songwriters or to match the prices offered by our competitors. Our Recorded Music business competes not only with other recorded music companies, but also with recording artists who may choose to distribute their own works (which has become more practicable as music is distributed online rather than physically) and companies in other industries (such as Spotify) that may choose to sign direct deals with recording artists or recorded music companies. Our Music Publishing business competes not only with other music publishing companies, but also with songwriters who publish their own works and companies in other industries that may choose to sign direct deals with songwriters or music publishing companies. In addition to competition from traditional music industry players, we also face competition from new entrants, including investment funds that make acquisitions or investments in recorded music or music publishing catalogs and the income streams derived therefrom. The Recorded Music business also faces competition from other forms of entertainment and leisure activities, such as cable and satellite television, motion pictures and video games in physical and digital formats.\nOur prospects and financial results may be adversely affected if we fail to identify, sign and retain recording artists and songwriters and by the existence or absence of superstar releases.\nWe are dependent on identifying, signing and retaining recording artists with long-term potential, whose debut music is well received on release, whose subsequent music is anticipated by consumers and whose music will continue to generate sales as part of our catalog for years to come. The competition among record companies for such talent is intense. Competition among record companies to sell and otherwise market and promote music is also intense. We are also dependent on signing and retaining songwriters who will write the hit songs of today and the classics of tomorrow. The competition to sign songwriters and acquire copyrights to music and then collect fees for the use of the music in various forms of media is also intense. Our competitive position is dependent on our continuing ability to attract and develop recording artists and songwriters whose work can achieve a high degree of public acceptance and who can timely deliver their music to us. Our financial results may be adversely affected if we are unable to identify, sign and retain such recording artists and songwriters under terms that are economically attractive to us, including with respect to delivery commitments, advance and royalty obligations and rights retention. Our financial results may also be affected by the existence or absence of superstar recording artist releases during a particular period. Some music entertainment industry observers believe that the number of superstar recording acts with long-term appeal, both in terms of catalog sales and future releases, has declined in recent years. Additionally, our financial results are generally affected by the appeal of our recorded music and music publishing catalogs to consumers.\nIf streaming adoption or revenue grows less rapidly or levels off, our prospects and our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nStreaming revenue is important because it has offset declines in downloads and physical sales and represents a growing area of our business. According to IFPI, streaming revenue, which includes revenue from ad-supported and subscription services, accounted for approximately 95% of digital revenue in 2022, up approximately 2% year-over-year. There can be no assurance that this growth pattern will persist or that digital revenue will continue to grow at a rate sufficient to offset and exceed declines in downloads and physical sales. If growth in streaming revenue levels off or fails to grow as quickly as it has over the past several years, our business may experience reduced levels of revenue and operating income.\nWe are substantially dependent on a limited number of digital music services for the online distribution and marketing of our music, and they are able to significantly influence the pricing structure for online music stores and may not correctly calculate royalties under license agreements.\nWe derive an increasing portion of our revenue from the licensing of music through digital distribution channels. We are currently dependent on a small number of leading digital music services. In fiscal year 2023, revenue earned under our license agreements with our top three digital music accounts, Spotify, Google/YouTube and Apple, accounted for approximately 41% of our total revenue. We have limited ability to increase our wholesale prices to digital music services as a small number of digital music services control much of the legitimate digital music business. If these services were to adopt a lower pricing model or if there were structural changes to other pricing models, we could receive substantially less for our music, which could cause a material reduction in our revenue, unless offset by a corresponding increase in the number of subscribers or transactions. We currently enter into short-term license agreements with many digital music services and provide our music on an at-will basis to others. There can be no assurance that we will be able to renew or enter into new license agreements with any digital music service. The terms of these license agreements, including the royalties that we receive pursuant to them, may change as a result of changes in our bargaining power, changes in the industry, changes in the law or for other reasons. Decreases in royalty rates, rates of revenue sharing or changes to other terms of these license agreements may materially impact our business, operating results and financial condition. Digital music services generally accept and make available all of the music that we deliver to them. However, if digital music services in the future decide to limit the types or amount of music they will accept from music entertainment companies like us, our revenue could be significantly reduced. See Business-Recorded Music-Sales and Digital Distribution.\nWe are also substantially dependent on a limited number of digital music services for the marketing of our music. A significant proportion of the music streamed on digital music services is from playlists curated by those services or generated from those services algorithms. If these services were to fail to include our music on playlists, change the position of our music on playlists or give us less marketing space, it could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUnder our license agreements and relevant statutes, we receive royalties from digital music services in exchange for the rights to stream or otherwise offer our music. The determination of the amount and timing of such payments is complex and subject to a number of variables, including the revenue generated, the type of music offered and the country in which it is sold, identification of the appropriate licensor, and the service tier on which music is made available. As a result, we may not be paid appropriately for our music. Failure to be accurately paid our royalties may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business operations in some foreign countries subject us to trends, developments or other events which may affect us adversely.\nWe are a global company with strong local presences, which have become increasingly important as the popularity of music originating from a countrys own language and culture has increased in recent years. Our mix of national and international recording artists and songwriters is designed to provide a significant degree of diversification. However, our music does not necessarily enjoy universal appeal and if it does not continue to appeal in various countries, our results of operations could be adversely impacted. As a result, our results can be affected not only by general industry trends, but also by trends, developments or other events in individual countries, including:\nlimited legal protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights;\nrestrictions on the repatriation of capital;\nfluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates;\ndifferences and unexpected changes in regulatory environment, including environmental, health and safety, local planning, zoning and labor laws, rules and regulations;\nvarying tax regimes which could adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows, including regulations relating to transfer pricing and withholding taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries and joint ventures;\nimposition of a global minimum tax rate, including by the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD);\nexposure to different legal standards and enforcement mechanisms and the associated cost of compliance;\ndifficulties in attracting and retaining qualified management and employees or rationalizing our workforce;\ntariffs, duties, export controls and other trade barriers;\nglobal economic and retail environment;\nlonger accounts receivable settlement cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\nrecessionary trends, inflation and instability of the financial markets;\nhigher interest rates; and\narmed conflicts or political instability.\nWe may not be able to insure or hedge against these risks, and we may not be able to ensure compliance with all of the applicable regulations without incurring additional costs, or at all. For example, our results of operations could be impacted by fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against most currencies. See -Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, financing may not be available in countries with less than investment-grade sovereign credit ratings. As a result, it may be difficult to create or maintain profitable operations in various countries.\nIn addition, our results can be affected by trends, developments and other events in individual countries. There can be no assurance that in the future country-specific trends, developments or other events will not have a significant adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Unfavorable conditions can depress revenues in any given market and prompt promotional or other actions that adversely affect our margins.\nOn February 24, 2022, the geopolitical situation in Eastern Europe intensified with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the sanctions and other measures imposed in response to this conflict have increased global economic and political uncertainty. We own Recorded Music and Music Publishing businesses within Russia and, on March 10, 2022, the Company announced a suspension of these operations. In addition, on October 7, 2023, Hamas led attacks against Israel. In response to the attacks, Israel formally declared war on Hamas and the armed conflict in Israel and Gaza is ongoing. While our operations in Russia and Israel do not constitute a material portion of our business, a prolonged continuation, significant escalation or expansion of these conflicts current scope, increased or sustained economic disruption, sanctions or countersanctions, further devaluation of local currencies or increased cyber-related disruptions affecting these countries or adjacent territories could make it difficult to deliver our content, increase costs, and have an adverse effect on our results of operations in these areas.\nUnfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs we continue to expand our international operations, we become increasingly exposed to the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. We have substantial assets, liabilities, revenues and costs denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at then-applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. These translations could result in significant changes to our results of operations from period to period. Prior to intersegment eliminations, 54% of our revenues related to operations in foreign territories for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. From time to time, we enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. During the current fiscal year, we have hedged a portion of our material foreign currency exposures related to royalty payments remitted between our foreign affiliates and our U.S. affiliates. However, these hedging strategies should not be expected to fully eliminate the foreign exchange rate risk to which we are exposed.\nOur business may be adversely affected by competitive market conditions, and we may not be able to execute our business strategy.\nWe expect to increase revenues and cash flow through a business strategy which requires us, among other things, to continue to maximize the value of our music, to significantly reduce costs to maximize flexibility and adjust to new realities of the market, to continue to act to contain digital piracy and to diversify our revenue streams into growing segments of the music entertainment business by capitalizing on digital distribution and emerging technologies, entering into expanded-rights deals with recording artists and operating our artist services businesses.\nEach of these initiatives requires sustained management focus, organization and coordination over significant periods of time. Each of these initiatives also requires success in building relationships with third parties and in anticipating and keeping up with technological developments and consumer preferences and may involve the implementation of new business models or distribution platforms. The results of our strategy and the success of our implementation of this strategy will not be known for some time in the future. If we are unable to implement our strategy successfully or properly react to changes in market conditions, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur business is to a large extent dependent on technological developments, including access to and selection and viability of new technologies, and is subject to potential pressure from competitors as a result of their technological developments. For example, our business may be further adversely affected by technological developments that facilitate the piracy of music, by an inability to enforce our intellectual property rights in digital environments and by a failure to further develop successful business models applicable to a digital environment.\nOur ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain our executive officers.\nWe compete with other music entertainment companies and other companies for top talent, including executive officers. Our success depends, in part, upon the continuing contributions of our executive officers, however, there is no guarantee that they will not leave. We have at-will employment contracts with a number of our executives, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and, therefore, these employees are free to leave at any time subject to certain notice provisions. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or key members of management or the failure to attract and retain other executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our business or our business prospects.\nA significant portion of our revenue is subject to rate regulation either by government entities or by local third-party collecting societies throughout the world and rates on other income streams may be set by governmental proceedings, which may limit our profitability.\nMechanical royalties and performance royalties are two of the main sources of income to our Music Publishing business and mechanical royalties are a significant expense to our Recorded Music business. In the United States, mechanical royalty rates are set every five years pursuant to an administrative process under the U.S. Copyright Act, unless rates are determined through industry negotiations, and performance royalty rates are determined by negotiations with performing rights societies, the largest of which, ASCAP and BMI, are subject to a consent decree rate-setting process if negotiations are unsuccessful. Outside the United States, mechanical and performance royalty rates are typically negotiated on an industry-wide basis. In most territories outside the United States, mechanical royalties are based on a percentage of wholesale prices for physical product and based on a percentage of consumer prices for digital formats. The mechanical and performance royalty rates set pursuant to such processes may adversely affect us by limiting our ability to increase the profitability of our Music Publishing business. If the mechanical and performance royalty rates are set too high it may also adversely affect us by limiting our ability to increase the profitability of our Recorded Music business. In addition, rates our Recorded Music business receives in the United States for webcasting and satellite radio are set every five years by an administrative process under the U.S. Copyright Act unless rates are determined through industry negotiations. It is important as revenue continues to shift from physical to diversified distribution channels that we receive fair value for all of the uses of our intellectual property as our business model now depends upon multiple revenue streams from multiple sources. The rates set for recorded music and music publishing income sources through collecting societies or legally prescribed rate-setting processes could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects.\nAn impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible and long-lived assets could negatively affect our operating results and equity.\nAs of September 30, 2023, we had $1.993 billion of goodwill and $149 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (ASC 350) requires that we test these assets for impairment annually (or more frequently should indications of impairment arise) by first assessing qualitative factors and then by quantitatively estimating the fair value of each of our reporting units (calculated using a discounted cash flow method) and comparing that value to the reporting units carrying value, if necessary. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, there is a potential impairment and additional testing must be performed. In performing our annual tests and determining whether indications of impairment exist, we consider numerous factors including actual and projected operating results of each reporting unit, external market factors such as market prices for similar assets and trends in the music entertainment industry. We performed an annual assessment, at July 1, 2023, of the recoverability of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles as of September 30, 2023, noting no instances of impairment. However, future events may occur that could adversely affect the estimated fair value of our reporting units. Such events may include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions and the impact of the economic environment on our operating results. Failure to achieve sufficient levels of cash flow at our reporting units could also result in impairment charges on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. If the value of the acquired goodwill or acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets is impaired, our operating results and shareholders equity could be adversely affected.\nWe also had $2.353 billion of definite-lived intangible assets as of September 30, 2023. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC Topic 360-10-35 (ASC 360-10-35) requires companies to review these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. No such events or circumstances were identified during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. If similar events occur as enumerated above such that we believe indicators of impairment are present, we would test for recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset. If those net undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount, we would perform the next step, which is to determine the fair value of the asset, which could result in an impairment charge. Any impairment charge recorded could negatively affect our operating results and shareholders equity.\nIf we acquire, combine with or invest in other businesses, we will face risks inherent in such transactions.\nWe have in the past considered and will continue, from time to time, to consider, opportunistic strategic or transformative transactions, which could involve acquisitions, combinations or dispositions of businesses or assets, or strategic alliances or joint ventures with companies engaged in music entertainment, entertainment or other businesses. Any such combination could be material, be difficult to implement, disrupt our business or change our business profile, focus or strategy significantly.\nAny future transaction could involve numerous risks, including:\npotential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;\npotential loss of recording artists or songwriters from our rosters;\ndifficulty integrating the acquired businesses or segregating assets to be disposed of;\nexposure to unknown and/or contingent or other liabilities, including litigation arising in connection with the acquisition, disposition and/or against any businesses we may acquire;\nreputational or other damages to our business as a result of a failure to consummate such a transaction for, among other reasons, failure to gain antitrust approval; and\nchanging our business profile in ways that could have unintended consequences.\nIf we enter into significant transactions in the future, related accounting charges may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, particularly in the case of any acquisitions. In addition, the financing of any significant acquisition may result in changes in our capital structure, including the incurrence of additional indebtedness, which may be substantial. Conversely, any material disposition could reduce our indebtedness or require the amendment or refinancing of our outstanding indebtedness or a portion thereof. We may not be successful in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any strategic or transformative transactions. We cannot assure you that if we make any future acquisitions, investments, strategic alliances or joint ventures or enter into any business combination that they will be completed in a timely manner, or at all, that they will be structured or financed in a way that will enhance our creditworthiness or that they will meet our strategic objectives or otherwise be successful. We also may not be successful in implementing appropriate operational, financial and management systems and controls to achieve the benefits expected to result from these transactions. Failure to effectively manage any of these transactions could result in material increases in costs or reductions in expected revenues, or both. In addition, if any new business in which we invest or which we attempt to develop does not progress as planned, we may not recover the funds and resources we have expended and this could have a negative impact on our businesses or our company as a whole.\nWe have outsourced certain finance and accounting functions and may outsource other back-office functions, which will make us more dependent upon third parties.\nIn an effort to be more efficient and generate cost savings, we have outsourced certain finance and accounting functions. As a result, we rely on third parties to ensure that our needs are sufficiently met. This reliance subjects us to risks arising from the loss of control over processes, changes in pricing that may affect our operating results, and potentially, termination of these services by our suppliers. A failure of our service providers to perform services in a satisfactory manner may have a significant adverse effect on our business. We may outsource other back-office functions in the future, which would increase our reliance on third parties.\nWe have engaged in substantial restructuring activities in the past, and may need to implement further restructurings in the future and our restructuring efforts may not be successful or generate expected cost savings.\nOur business is significantly impacted by ongoing changes in the music entertainment industry. In response, we actively seek to adapt our cost structure to the changing economics of the industry. For example, we have shifted and continue to shift resources from our physical sales channels to efforts focused on digital channels, emerging technologies and other new revenue streams, and we continue our efforts to reduce overhead and manage our variable and fixed-cost structure. In fiscal year 2018, we completed the creation of our new center of excellence for U.S. financial shared services in Nashville, Tennessee, which combined our U.S. transactional financial functions in one location. To establish the new center, we moved some of our U.S. departments to Nashville. We are continuing our financial transformation initiative, launched in August 2019, to upgrade our information technology and finance infrastructure, including related systems and processes. The timing of global deployment has been delayed as the size and scale of this global system implementation requires rigorous system testing and data validation to ensure go-live readiness. To address these implementation requirements, we are deploying our new technology platform in a wave-based approach. In 2023, we successfully launched certain components of our new technology platform in select territories in two successful waves in April and August and will continue to deploy the platform to remaining territories through fiscal year 2024 and into fiscal year 2025. We expect to incur material costs in connection with this project, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in upgrading our systems and processes effectively or on the timetable and at the costs contemplated, or that we will achieve the expected long-term cost savings.\nIn March 2023, we announced a restructuring plan, primarily consisting of headcount reductions, for which we incurred restructuring charges of approximately $40 million. We cannot be certain that we will not be required to implement further restructuring activities, make additions or other changes to our management or workforce based on other cost reduction measures or changes in the markets and industry in which we compete. Our inability to structure our operations based on evolving market conditions could impact our business. Restructuring activities can create unanticipated consequences and negative impacts on the business, and we cannot be sure that any ongoing or future restructuring efforts will be successful or generate expected cost savings.\nWe face a potential loss of catalog to the extent that our recording artists or songwriters have a right to recapture rights in their recordings or musical compositions under the U.S. Copyright Act.\nThe U.S. Copyright Act provides authors (or their heirs) a right to terminate U.S. licenses or assignments of rights in their copyrighted works in certain circumstances. This right does not apply to works that are works made for hire. Since the enactment of the Sound Recordings Act of 1971, which first accorded federal copyright protection for sound recordings in the U.S., virtually all of our agreements with recording artists provide that such recording artists render services under a work-made-for-hire relationship. A termination right exists under the U.S. Copyright Act for U.S. rights in musical compositions that are not works made for hire. If any of our commercially available sound recordings were determined not to be works made for hire, then the recording artists (or their heirs) could have the right to terminate the U.S. federal copyright rights they granted to us, generally during a five-year period starting at the end of 35 years from the date of release of a recording under a post-1977 license or assignment (or, in the case of a pre-1978 grant in a pre-1978 recording, generally during a five-year period starting at the end of 56 years from the date of copyright). A termination of U.S. federal copyright rights could have an adverse effect on our Recorded Music business. From time to time, authors (or their heirs) have the opportunity to terminate our U.S. rights in musical compositions. We believe the effect of any potential terminations is already reflected in the financial results of our business.\nGovernments could enact new legislation or could make regulatory determinations that affect the terms of our contracts with recording artists and songwriters.\nSome performer groups, particularly in Europe, are urging governments to intervene in the music streaming business in ways that could affect the terms agreed in our contracts with artists and songwriters. Governments, including states in the United States, have enacted or considered enacting legislation limiting the duration that an individual can be bound under a personal services contract, which could impair our ability to retain the services of key artists and songwriters. Government intervention in the music streaming business or enactment of legislation affecting the terms of our contracts with our artists and songwriters could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFulfilling our obligations incident to being a public company is expensive and time-consuming, and any delays or difficulties in satisfying these obligations could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and our stock price.\nWe are subject to the reporting, accounting and corporate governance requirements applicable to issuers of listed equity, including the listing standards of NASDAQ and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The expenses associated with being a public company include increases in auditing, accounting and legal fees and expenses, investor relations expenses, increased directors fees and director and officer liability insurance costs, registrar and transfer agent fees and listing fees, as well as other expenses. Failure to\ncomply with any of the public company requirements applicable to us could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property and Data Security\nFailure to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could substantially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights. The measures that we take to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, including, if necessary, litigation or proceedings before governmental authorities and administrative bodies, may be ineffective, expensive and time-consuming and, despite such measures, third parties may be able to obtain and use our intellectual property rights without our permission. Additionally, changes in law may be implemented, or changes in interpretation of such laws may occur, that may affect our ability to obtain, maintain, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights. Failure to obtain, maintain, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our brand or brand recognition and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe also in-license certain major trademarks from third parties, including the WARNER, WARNER MUSIC and WARNER RECORDS trademarks and the W logo, pursuant to a perpetual, royalty-free license agreement that may be terminated by the licensor under certain circumstances, including our material breach of the license agreement and certain events of insolvency. Upon any such termination, we may be required to either negotiate a new or reinstated agreement with less favorable terms or otherwise lose our rights to use the licensed trademarks, which may require us to change our corporate name and undergo other significant rebranding efforts. Any such rebranding efforts may be disruptive to our business operations, require us to incur significant expenses and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nOur involvement in intellectual property litigation could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is highly dependent upon intellectual property, an area that has encountered increased litigation in recent years. If we are alleged to infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of a third party, any litigation to defend the claim could be costly and would divert the time and resources of management, regardless of the merits of the claim and whether the claim is settled out of court or determined in our favor. There can be no assurance that we would prevail in any such litigation. If we were to lose a litigation relating to intellectual property, we could be forced to pay monetary damages and to cease using certain intellectual property or technologies. Any of the foregoing may adversely affect our business.\nDigital piracy continues to adversely impact our business.\nA substantial portion of our revenue comes from the distribution of music which is potentially subject to unauthorized consumer copying and widespread digital dissemination without an economic return to us, including as a result of stream-ripping. In its Engaging with Music 2022 report, IFPI surveyed 44,000 people to examine the ways in which music consumers engaged with recorded music across 22 countries. Of those surveyed, 30% had used illegal or unlicensed methods to listen to or download music, and 17% had used unlicensed social media platforms and mobile apps for music purposes, the leading form of music piracy. Organized industrial piracy may also lead to decreased revenues. The impact of digital piracy on legitimate music revenues and subscriptions is hard to quantify, but we believe that illegal file sharing and other forms of unauthorized activity, including stream manipulation, have a substantial negative impact on music revenues. Also, despite the potential benefit of AI, the potential for AI-generated music has also introduced new challenges for protecting our intellectual property and other rights of our artists and songwriters. These challenges include new forms of intellectual property infringement through the unauthorized reproduction of copyrighted works and the name, images, likeness and voices of our artists and songwriters to train AI applications and to create unauthorized derivative works.\nIf we fail to obtain appropriate relief through the judicial process or the complete enforcement of judicial decisions issued in our favor (or if judicial decisions are not in our favor), if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to lobby governments to enact and enforce stronger legal penalties for copyright infringement or if we fail to develop effective means of protecting and enforcing our intellectual property (whether copyrights or other intellectual property rights such as patents, trademarks and trade secrets) or our music entertainment-related products or services, our results of operations, financial position and prospects may suffer.\nIf we or our service providers do not maintain the security of information relating to our customers, employees and vendors and our music, security information breaches through cyber security attacks or otherwise could damage our reputation with customers, employees, vendors and artists, and we could incur substantial additional costs, become subject to litigation and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Moreover, even if we or our service providers maintain such security, such breaches remain a possibility due to the fact that no data security system is immune from attacks or other incidents.\nWe receive certain personal information about our customers and potential customers, and we also receive personal information concerning our employees, artists and vendors. In addition, our online operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. We maintain security measures with respect to such information, but despite these measures, our service providers have experienced security breaches in the past and remain vulnerable to security breaches by computer hackers and others that attempt to penetrate the security measures that we have in place. A compromise of our security systems or our service providers security systems (through cyber-attacks, which are rapidly evolving and sophisticated, or otherwise) that results in personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons or other bad acts could adversely affect our reputation with our customers, potential customers, employees, artists and vendors, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of governmental penalties. Unauthorized persons have also attempted to redirect payments to or from us. If any such attempt were successful, we could lose and fail to recover the redirected funds, which loss could be material. We may also be subject to cyber-attacks that target our music, including not-yet-released music. The theft and premature release of this music may adversely affect our reputation with current and potential artists and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations.\nWe increasingly rely on third-party data storage providers, including cloud storage solution providers, resulting in less direct control over our data. Such third parties may also be vulnerable to security breaches and compromised security systems, which could adversely affect our business.\nEvolving laws and regulations concerning data privacy may result in increased regulation and different industry standards, which could result in monetary penalties, increase the costs of operations or limit our activities.\nWe engage in a wide array of online activities globally and are thus subject to a broad range of related laws and regulations including, for example, those relating to privacy, consumer protection, data retention and data protection, online behavioral advertising, geo-location tracking, text messaging, e-mail advertising, mobile advertising, content regulation, defamation, age verification, the protection of children online, social media and other Internet, mobile and online-related prohibitions and restrictions. The regulatory framework for privacy and data security issues worldwide has become increasingly burdensome and complex, and is likely to continue to be so for the foreseeable future. Practices regarding the collection, use, storage, transmission, security and disclosure of personal information by companies operating over the Internet and mobile platforms are receiving ever-increasing public and governmental scrutiny.\nThe U.S. government, including Congress, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce, has announced that it is reviewing the need for even greater regulation for the collection of information concerning consumer behavior on the Internet and mobile platforms, including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices, the use of location data and disclosures of privacy practices in the online and mobile environments, including with respect to online and mobile applications. State governments are engaged in similar legislative and regulatory activities (including the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) effective on January 1, 2020, the California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act, effective January 1, 2023 (CPRA) and other analogous statutes more recently in other states). The effects of CCPA and these other recently adopted laws includes an increased ability of individuals to control the use of their personal data; heightened transparency obligations, increased obligations of companies to maintain the security of data; and increased exposure to fines or damages for companies that do not accord individuals their specified privacy rights, that experience data breaches or that do not maintain cybersecurity at certain levels of quality.\nIn addition, privacy and data security laws and regulations around the world are being implemented rapidly and evolving. These new and evolving laws (including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation effective on May 25, 2018) have resulted in greater compliance burdens for companies with global operations. Globally, many government and consumer agencies have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices with respect to information collected from consumers, electronic marketing and the use of third-party cookies, web beacons and similar technology for online behavioral advertising.\nOur business, including our ability to operate and expand internationally, could be adversely affected if laws or regulations are adopted, interpreted or implemented in a manner that is inconsistent with our current business practices and that require changes to these practices. Therefore, our business could be harmed by any significant change to applicable laws, regulations or industry practices regarding the collection, use or disclosure of customer data, or regarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of consumers for such collection, use and disclosure is obtained. Such changes may require us to modify our operations, possibly in a material manner, and may limit our ability to develop new products, services, mechanisms, platforms and features that make use of data regarding our customers and potential customers. Any actual or alleged violations of laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security, and any relevant claims, may expose us to potential liability, fines and may require us to expend significant resources in responding to and defending such allegations and claims, regardless of merit. Claims or allegations that we have violated laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security could also result in negative publicity and a loss of confidence in us.\nRisks Related to Our Leverage\nOur substantial leverage on a consolidated basis could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness.\nWe are highly leveraged. As of September 30, 2023, our total consolidated indebtedness, net of premiums, discounts and deferred financing costs, was $3.964 billion. Further, we would have been able to borrow up to $298 million under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined later in this Annual Report) as of September 30, 2023 (after giving effect to approximately $2 million of letters of credit outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2023). On November 1, 2022, Acquisition Corp. borrowed $150 million under a new tranche of its term loan facility, the proceeds of which will be used to pay the deferred purchase price of certain music and music-related assets, to pay fees and expenses relating thereto and for general corporate purposes.\nOur high degree of leverage could have important consequences for our investors. For example, it may make it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness; increase our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions, including recessions and periods of significant inflation and financial market volatility; expose us to the risk of increased interest rates because any borrowings we make under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at variable rates; require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other expenses; limit our ability to refinance existing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all or borrow additional funds in the future for, among other things, working capital, acquisitions or debt service requirements; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness; and limit our ability to borrow additional funds that may be needed to operate and expand our business.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in the indentures governing our outstanding notes as well as under the Senior Credit Facilities. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify.\nThe indentures that govern our outstanding notes and the credit agreements that govern the Senior Credit Facilities (as defined later in this Annual Report) contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Those covenants include restrictions on our ability to, among other things, create liens and merge or consolidate. In addition, our Revolving Credit Facility includes additional covenants which restrict our ability to, among other things, incur more indebtedness, pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions, make investments, transfer or sell assets and enter into certain transactions with our affiliates. These additional covenants are currently suspended. These covenants will be reinstated if Acquisition Corp.s Total Indebtedness to EBITDA Ratio increases above 3.50:1.00 and the term loans do not achieve an investment grade rating. Should these covenants be reinstated, they would limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness. Any such event of default or acceleration could have an adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nAs a holding company, the Company depends on the ability of its subsidiaries to transfer funds to it to meet its obligations.\nThe Company is a holding company for all of our operations and is a legal entity separate from its subsidiaries. Dividends and other distributions from the Companys subsidiaries are the principal sources of funds available to the Company to pay corporate operating expenses, to pay stockholder dividends, to repurchase stock and to meet its other obligations. The inability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nThe subsidiaries of the Company have no obligation to pay amounts due on any liabilities of the Company or to make funds available to the Company for such payments. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or other distributions to the Company in the future will depend, among other things, on their earnings, tax considerations and covenants contained in any financing or other agreements. For instance, our Revolving Credit Facility includes covenants restricting the ability of Acquisition Corp. to pay dividends and make distributions. Although these covenants are currently suspended, they will be reinstated if Acquisition Corp.s Total Indebtedness to EBITDA Ratio increases above 3.50:1.00 and the term loans do not achieve an investment grade rating. In addition, such payments may be limited as a result of claims against our subsidiaries by their creditors, including suppliers, vendors, lessors and employees.\nIf the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions or payments to the Company is materially restricted by cash needs, bankruptcy or insolvency, or is limited due to operating results or other factors, we may be required to raise cash through the incurrence of debt, the issuance of equity or the sale of assets. However, there is no assurance that we would be able to raise sufficient cash by these means. This could materially and adversely affect our ability to pay our obligations or pay dividends, which could have an adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nAcquisition Corp. may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy its obligations under its indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nAcquisition Corp.s ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance its debt obligations depends on its financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Acquisition Corp. may not maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nAcquisition Corp. will rely on its subsidiaries to make payments on its borrowings. If these subsidiaries do not dividend funds to Acquisition Corp. in an amount sufficient to make such payments, if necessary in the future, Acquisition Corp. may default under the indentures or credit agreements governing its borrowings, which would result in all such borrowings becoming due and payable.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nThe indentures governing our outstanding notes and the credit agreements governing the Senior Credit Facilities contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: create liens on certain debt and consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.\nIn addition, our Revolving Credit Facility includes additional covenants that would limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:\npay dividends on, and redeem and purchase, equity interests;\nmake other restricted payments; make prepayments on, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\nincur certain additional debt; enter into guarantees and hedging arrangements;\nenter into acquisitions and asset sales;\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\npay dividends or make distributions;\namend the terms of subordinated debt and unsecured bonds; and\nmake certain capital expenditures.\nThese additional covenants are currently suspended. These covenants will be reinstated if Acquisition Corp.s Total Indebtedness to EBITDA Ratio increases above 3.50:1.00 and the term loans do not achieve an investment grade rating.\nOur ability to borrow additional amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility depends upon satisfaction of these covenants. Events beyond our control can affect our ability to meet these covenants. In addition, under the credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, a financial maintenance covenant is applicable if at the end of a fiscal quarter the outstanding amount of loans and letters of credit is in excess of $105 million.\nOur failure to comply with obligations under the instruments governing our indebtedness may result in an event of default under such instruments. We cannot be certain that we will have funds available to remedy these defaults. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have\nsufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness or will have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all.\nAll of these restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business or may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise, and may have an adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock. We may, from time to time, refinance our existing indebtedness, which could result in the agreements governing any new indebtedness having fewer or less restrictive covenants.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments in recording artists and songwriters, capital expenditures or dividends, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. In addition, funds used to pay dividends to our shareholders will not be available to service our indebtedness.\nDespite our indebtedness levels, we may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness, which may increase the risks created by our substantial indebtedness.\nWe may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including additional secured indebtedness, in the future. The indentures governing our outstanding notes and the credit agreements governing the Senior Credit Facilities will not prohibit us, Holdings or our subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness under certain circumstances. We, Holdings or our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, which may increase the risks created by our current substantial indebtedness.\nOur ability to incur secured indebtedness is subject to compliance with certain secured leverage ratios that are calculated as of the date of incurrence. The amount of secured indebtedness that we are able to incur and the timing of any such incurrence under these ratios vary from time to time and are a function of several variables, including our outstanding indebtedness and our results of operations calculated as of specified dates or for certain periods.\nTo the extent that the terms of our current debt agreements would prevent us from incurring additional indebtedness, we may be able to obtain amendments to those agreements that would allow us to incur such additional indebtedness, and such additional indebtedness could be material.\nWe will require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness. The ability to generate cash or refinance indebtedness as it becomes due depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance our obligations under, our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and other corporate expenses will depend on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive, legislative and other factors and any legal and regulatory restrictions on the payment of distributions and dividends to which they may be subject. Many of these factors are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or to fund our other needs. To satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures, we must continue to execute our business strategy. If we are unable to do so, we may need to reduce or delay our planned capital expenditures or refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. Significant delays in our planned capital expenditures may materially and adversely affect our future revenue prospects. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. While limited by the terms of our debt agreements, if we were to pay dividends to our shareholders, the funds used to make such dividend payments would not be available to service our indebtedness.\nA downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of the rating assigned by a rating agency to us could cause the liquidity or market value of our indebtedness to decline and our cost of capital to increase.\nAny future downgrade of our ratings may make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing. Therefore, although reductions in our debt ratings may not have an immediate impact on the cost of debt or our liquidity, they may impact the cost of debt and liquidity over the medium term and future access at a reasonable rate to the debt markets may be adversely impacted.\nRisks Related to Our Controlling Stockholder\nAccess continues to control us and may have conflicts of interest with other stockholders. Conflicts of interest may arise because affiliates of our controlling stockholder have continuing agreements and business relationships with us.\nAccess holds approximately 98% of the total combined voting power of our outstanding common stock and approximately 73% of the economic interest of our outstanding common stock. As a result, and in addition to certain other rights granted to Access, Access will continue to be able to control the election of our directors, affect our legal and capital structure, change our management, determine our corporate and management policies and determine, without the consent of our other stockholders, the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders for approval, including potential mergers or acquisitions, asset sales and other significant corporate transactions. Access also has sufficient voting power to amend our organizational documents. In addition, under the provisions of a stockholder agreement entered into with Access (the Stockholder Agreement), the relevant terms of which govern the powers afforded the Company under our organizational documents, Access has consent rights with respect to certain corporate and business activities that we may undertake, including during periods where Access holds less than a majority of the total combined voting power of our outstanding common stock. Specifically, the Stockholder Agreement provides that, until the date on which Access ceases to hold at least 10% of our outstanding common stock, Accesss prior written consent will be required before we may take certain corporate and business actions, whether directly or indirectly through a subsidiary, including, among others, the following:\nany merger, consolidation or similar transaction (or any amendment to or termination of an agreement to enter into such a transaction) with or into any other person whether in a single transaction or a series of transactions, subject to certain specified exceptions;\nany acquisition or disposition of securities, assets or liabilities, subject to certain specified exceptions;\nany change in our authorized capital stock or the creation of any new class or series of our capital stock;\nany issuance or acquisition of capital stock (including stock buy-backs, redemptions or other reductions of capital), or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for capital stock or equity-linked securities, subject to certain specified exceptions;\nany issuance or acquisition of debt securities to or from a third party, subject to certain specified exceptions; and\nany amendment (or approval or recommendation of any amendment) to our certificate of incorporation or by-laws.\nAs a result of these consent rights, Access will maintain significant control over our corporate and business activities until such rights cease.\nAdditionally, until Access ceases to hold more than 50% of the total combined voting power of our outstanding common stock, pursuant to Section 141(a) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (DGCL), our Executive Committee, as the Companys governing body, has all of the power and authority (including voting power) of our board of directors. The Executive Committee has the authority to approve any actions of the Company, except for matters that must be approved by the Audit Committee of our board of directors (or both the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee), or by a committee or sub-committee qualified to grant equity to persons subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act for purposes of exempting transactions pursuant to Section 16b-3 thereunder, or as required under Delaware law, SEC rules and NASDAQ rules.\nAccess also has the power to direct us to engage in strategic transactions, with or involving other companies in our industry, including acquisitions, combinations or dispositions, and the acquisition of certain assets that may become available for purchase, and any such transaction could be material.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated by-laws also include a number of provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control for so long as Access owns specified percentages of our common stock. See -Risks Related to Our Common Stock-Anti-takeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company and may affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock. These provisions not only could have a negative impact on the trading price of our Class A Common Stock, but could also allow Access to delay or prevent a corporate transaction of which the public stockholders approve.\nAdditionally, Access is in the business of making investments in companies and is actively seeking to acquire interests in businesses that operate in our industry and other industries and may compete, directly or indirectly, with us. Access may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, which could have the effect of making such acquisition opportunities unavailable to us. Access could elect to cause us to enter into business combinations or other transactions with any business or businesses in our industry that Access may acquire or control, or we could become part of a group of companies organized\nunder the ultimate common control of Access that may be operated in a manner different from the manner in which we have historically operated. Any such business combination transaction could require that we or such group of companies incur additional indebtedness, and could also require us or any acquired business to make divestitures of assets necessary or desirable to obtain regulatory approval for such transaction. The amounts of such additional indebtedness, and the size of any such divestitures, could be material. Access may also from time to time purchase outstanding debt securities that we issued, and could also subsequently sell any such debt securities. Any such purchase or sale may affect the value of, trading price or liquidity of our debt securities. See -Under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, Access and its affiliates, and in some circumstances, any of our directors and officers who is also a director, officer, employee, stockholder, member or partner of Access and its affiliates, have no obligation to offer us corporate opportunities.\nConflicts of interest may arise between our controlling stockholder and us. Affiliates of our controlling stockholder engage in transactions with us. Further, Access may, from time to time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us, and they may either directly, or through affiliates, also maintain business relationships with companies that may directly compete with us. In general, Access or its affiliates could pursue business interests or exercise their voting power as stockholders in ways that are detrimental to us but beneficial to themselves or to other companies in which they invest or with whom they have a material relationship. In addition, a number of persons who currently are our directors and officers have been and remain otherwise affiliated with Access and, in some cases, such affiliations also involve financial interests. These relationships may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for Access and us.\nAs a result of these relationships, the interests of Access may not coincide with our interests or the interests of the holders of our Class A Common Stock. So long as Access continues to control a significant amount of the total combined voting power of our outstanding common stock, Access will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions, including potential mergers or acquisitions, asset sales and other significant corporate transactions.\nUnder our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, Access and its affiliates, and in some circumstances, any of our directors and officers who is also a director, officer, employee, stockholder, member or partner of Access and its affiliates, have no obligation to offer us corporate opportunities.\nThe policies relating to corporate opportunities and transactions with Access and its affiliates set forth in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, address potential conflicts of interest between the Company, on the one hand, and Access, its affiliates and its directors, officers, employees, stockholders, members or partners who are directors or officers of the Company, on the other hand. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we, on our behalf and on behalf of our subsidiaries, renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, corporate opportunities, that are from time to time presented to Access or any of its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, stockholders, members or partners, even if the opportunity is one that we or our subsidiaries might reasonably be deemed to have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted the opportunity to do so. None of Access, its affiliates or any of its directors, officers, employees, stockholders, members or partners will generally be liable to us or any of our subsidiaries for breach of any fiduciary or other duty, as a director or otherwise, by reason of the fact that such person pursues, acquires or participates in such corporate opportunity, directs such corporate opportunity to another person or fails to present such corporate opportunity, or information regarding such corporate opportunity, to us or our subsidiaries unless, in the case of any such person who is a director or officer, such corporate opportunity is expressly offered to such director or officer in writing solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer. To the fullest extent permitted by law, by becoming a stockholder in our company, stockholders will be deemed to have notice of and consented to this provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Although these provisions are designed to resolve conflicts between us and Access and its affiliates fairly, conflicts may not be resolved in our favor or be resolved at all.\nIf Access sells a controlling interest in our company to a third party in a private transaction, our stockholders may not realize any change of control premium on shares of our Class A Common Stock and we may become subject to the control of a presently unknown third party.\nAccess has the ability, should it choose to do so, to sell some or all of its shares of our common stock in a privately negotiated transaction. If such a transaction were to be sufficient in size, it could result in a change of control of the Company. The ability of Access to privately sell such shares of our common stock, with no requirement for a concurrent offer to be made to acquire all of the shares of our Class A Common Stock, could prevent our stockholders from realizing any change of control premium on their shares of our Class A Common Stock that may otherwise accrue to Access upon its private sale of our common stock. Additionally, if Access privately sells a significant equity interest in us, we may become subject to the control of a presently unknown third party. Such third party may have conflicts of interest with the interests of other stockholders.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe dual class structure of our common stock and the existing ownership of Class B Common Stock by Access have the effect of concentrating voting control with Access for the foreseeable future, which will limit or preclude the ability of our other stockholders to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class A Common Stock has one vote per share and our Class B Common Stock has 20 votes per share. Given the greater number of votes per share attributed to our Class B Common Stock, Access, who is our only Class B Common Stock stockholder, holds approximately 98% of the total combined voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result of our dual class ownership structure, Access is able to exert a significant degree of influence or actual control over our management and affairs and over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, mergers or acquisitions, asset sales and other significant corporate transactions. Further, Access owns shares representing approximately 73% of the economic interest of our outstanding common stock. Because of the 20-to-1 voting ratio between the Class B Common Stock and Class A Common Stock, the holders of Class B Common Stock collectively continue to control a majority of the total combined voting power of our outstanding common stock and therefore be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, so long as the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock represent at least approximately 10% of the total number of outstanding shares of common stock. This concentrated control will limit the ability of our other stockholders to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future. For example, Access will be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our certificate of incorporation or by-laws, increases to the number of shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans or adoption of new equity incentive plans and approval of any merger or sale of assets for the foreseeable future. This control may materially adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock.\nAdditionally, the holders of our Class B Common Stock may cause us to make strategic decisions or pursue acquisitions that could involve risks to our other stockholders or may not be aligned with their interests. The holders of our Class B Common Stock will also be entitled to a separate vote in the event we seek to amend our certificate of incorporation.\nThe difference in the voting rights of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock may harm the value and liquidity of our Class A Common Stock.\nThe difference in the voting rights of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock could harm the value of our Class A Common Stock to the extent that any investor or potential future purchaser of our Class A Common Stock ascribes value to the right of holders of our Class B Common Stock to 20 votes per share of Class B Common Stock. The existence of two classes of common stock could also result in less liquidity for our Class A Common Stock than if there were only one class of our common stock.\nOur dual class structure may depress the trading price of our Class A Common Stock.\nOur dual class structure may result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A Common Stock or in adverse publicity or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers have announced restrictions on including companies with dual or multiple class share structures in certain of their indexes. S&P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell have announced changes to their eligibility criteria for inclusion of shares of public companies on certain indices, including the S&P 500. These changes exclude companies with multiple classes of shares of common stock from being added to these indices. In addition, several stockholder advisory firms have announced their opposition to the use of dual or multiple class structures. As a result, the dual class structure of our common stock may prevent the inclusion of our Class A Common Stock in these indices and may cause stockholder advisory firms to publish negative commentary about our corporate governance practices or otherwise seek to cause us to change our capital structure. Any such exclusion from indices could result in a less active trading market for our Class A Common Stock. Any actions or publications by stockholder advisory firms critical of our corporate governance practices or capital structure could also adversely affect the value of our Class A Common Stock.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nSales of substantial amounts of our Class A Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our Class A Common Stock to decline. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nAs of September 30, 2023, we had 138,344,724 outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and 377,650,449 outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock. All of the shares of Class A Common Stock sold in the IPO were immediately tradable without restriction under the Securities Act except for any shares held by affiliates, as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, or Rule 144.\nThe remaining shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding subsequent to the consummation of the IPO are restricted securities within the meaning of Rule 144, but will be eligible for resale subject, in certain cases, to applicable volume, manner of sale, holding period and other limitations of Rule 144 or pursuant to an exception from registration under Rule 701 under the Securities Act, or Rule 701. Access has the right to require us to register shares of common stock for resale in some circumstances pursuant to a registration rights agreement we entered into with Access. Access has in the past sold shares of common stock pursuant to Rule 144 and in registered offerings to the public, and depending upon market prices for the Companys common stock may again do so from time to time.\nAdditionally, shares of Class A Common Stock are registered under our registration statements on Form S-8 to be issued under our equity compensation plans, including the Plan, and, as a result, all shares of Class A Common Stock acquired upon settlement of deferred equity units granted under the Plan will also be freely tradable under the Securities Act, unless purchased by our affiliates. In addition, 31,169,099 shares of our Class A Common Stock were reserved for future issuances under the Omnibus Incentive Plan adopted in connection with the IPO over the 10-year period from the date of adoption. As of September 30, 2023, the Company has granted members of its Board of Directors a total of 280,945 shares of restricted and unrestricted common stock pursuant to the Omnibus Incentive Plan. These grants represent compensation for board service for the period from the grant date until the Companys regularly scheduled annual shareholder meeting, at which time the restricted stock will be vested. Directors are entitled to dividends on this restricted stock during the vesting period.\nIn the future, we may issue additional shares of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock or other equity or debt securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of our Class A Common Stock in connection with a financing, strategic investment, litigation settlement or employee arrangement or otherwise. Any of these issuances could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause the trading price of our Class A Common Stock to decline.\nThe market price of our Class A Common Stock may be volatile and could decline.\nThe market price of our Class A Common Stock may fluctuate significantly. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:\nindustry or general market conditions;\ndomestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance;\nchanges in our customers preferences;\nchanges in law or regulation;\nlawsuits, enforcement actions and other claims by third parties or governmental authorities;\nadverse publicity related to us or another industry participant;\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\nchanges in securities analysts estimates of our financial performance or lack of research coverage and reports by industry analysts;\naction by institutional stockholders or other large stockholders (including Access), including future sales of our Class A Common Stock;\nfailure to meet any guidance given by us or any change in any guidance given by us, or changes by us in our guidance practices;\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\ninvestor perception of us and our industry;\nchanges in market valuations or earnings of similar companies;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions or strategic partnerships;\nwar, terrorist acts, epidemic disease and pandemics, including COVID-19;\nany future sales of our Class A Common Stock or other securities;\nadditions or departures of key personnel; and\nmisconduct or other improper actions of our employees.\nStock markets have experienced extreme volatility in recent years that has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock. In the\npast, following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities, class action litigation has often been instituted against the affected company. Any litigation of this type brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDue to the nature of our business, our results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nOur results of operations are affected by the amount and quality of music that we release, the number of releases that include musical compositions published by us, timing of release schedules and, more importantly, the consumer demand for these releases. We also make advance payments to recording artists and songwriters, which impact our results of operations and operating cash flows. The timing of releases and advance payments is largely based on business and other considerations and is made without regard to the impact of the timing of the release on our financial results. In addition, certain of our license agreements with digital music services contain minimum guarantees and/or require that we are paid minimum guarantee payments. Our results of operations and cash flows in any reporting period may be materially affected by the timing of releases and advance payments and minimum guarantees, which may result in significant fluctuations from period to period, which may have an adverse impact on the price of our Class A Common Stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A Common Stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts downgrades our stock or publishes misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of the analysts ceases coverage of our Class A Common Stock or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our Class A Common Stock could decrease, which could cause our Class A Common Stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur existing debt securities do, and future offerings of debt or equity securities may, rank senior to our common stock, which may adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock.\nAs of September 30, 2023, our total consolidated indebtedness, net of premiums, discounts and deferred financing costs, was $3.964 billion, all of which ranks senior to our Class A Common Stock. On November 1, 2022, Acquisition Corp. borrowed $150 million under a new tranche of its term loan facility, the proceeds of which will be used to pay the deferred purchase price of certain music and music-related assets, to pay fees and expenses relating thereto and for general corporate purposes. If, in the future, we decide to issue additional debt or equity securities that rank senior to our Class A Common Stock, it is likely that such securities will also be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility consistent with our existing debt agreements. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our Class A Common Stock and may result in dilution to owners of our Class A Common Stock. We and, indirectly, our stockholders, bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our Class A Common Stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our Class A Common Stock and diluting the value of their stock holdings in us.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company and may affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated by-laws include a number of provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws collectively:\nauthorize two classes of common stock with disparate voting power;\npermit different treatment of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock in a change of control transaction if approved by a majority of the voting power of our outstanding Class A Common Stock and a majority of the voting power of our outstanding Class B Common Stock, voting separately;\nauthorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to thwart a takeover attempt;\nprovide that vacancies on our board of directors, including vacancies resulting from an enlargement of our board of directors, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office once Access ceases to beneficially own more than 50% of the total combined voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock;\nprohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders if Access ceases to beneficially own more than 50% of the total combined voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock;\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders, if Access ceases to beneficially own more than 50% of the total combined voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock;\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election as directors or to bring other business before an annual meeting of our stockholders;\nrequire the approval of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the total combined voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock to amend our amended and restated by-laws and certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation if Access ceases to beneficially own more than 50% of the total combined voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock; and\nsubject us to Section 203 of the DGCL, which limits the ability of stockholders holding shares representing more than 15% of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock from engaging in certain business combinations with us, once Access no longer owns at least 5% of the total combined voting power of our outstanding common stock.\nThese provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our Class A Common Stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our Class A Common Stock if the provisions are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our management. Furthermore, the existence of the foregoing provisions, as well as the significant amount of common stock that Access owns and voting power that Access holds, could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Class A Common Stock. These provisions may facilitate management and board entrenchment that may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nWe are a controlled company within the meaning of NASDAQ rules and, as a result, we qualify for, and intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nAccess holds approximately 98% of the total combined voting power of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, we qualify as a controlled company within the meaning of NASDAQ corporate governance standards. Under NASDAQ rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a controlled company and may elect not to comply with certain NASDAQ corporate governance standards, including:\nthe requirement that a majority of the members of our board of directors be independent directors;\nthe requirement that our nominating and corporate governance committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committees purpose and responsibilities;\nthe requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committees purpose and responsibilities; and\nthe requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees.\nWe intend to rely on these exemptions. As a result, we are not required to have a majority of independent directors, our compensation and our nominating and corporate governance committees will not consist entirely of independent directors and such committees may not be subject to annual performance evaluations. Consequently, our stockholders will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of NASDAQ corporate governance rules and requirements. Our status as a controlled company could make our Class A Common Stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation includes provisions limiting the personal liability of our directors for breaches of fiduciary duty under the DGCL.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions permitted under the action asserting a claim arising under the DGCL relating to the liability of directors. These provisions will eliminate a directors personal liability to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL for monetary damages resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty, except in circumstances involving:\nany breach of the directors duty of loyalty;\nacts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of the law;\nSection 174 of the DGCL (unlawful dividends); or\nany transaction from which the director derives an improper personal benefit.\nThe principal effect of the limitation on liability provision is that a stockholder will be unable to prosecute an action for monetary damages against a director unless the stockholder can demonstrate a basis for liability for which indemnification is not available under the DGCL. These provisions, however, should not limit or eliminate our rights or any stockholders rights to seek non-monetary relief, such as an injunction or rescission, in the event of a breach of a directors fiduciary duty. These provisions will not alter a directors liability under federal securities laws. The inclusion of this provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for a breach of their fiduciary duties, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise have benefited us and our stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our stockholders by any of our directors, officers, other employees, agents or stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising out of or under the DGCL, or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (including, without limitation, any action asserting a claim arising out of or pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated by-laws) or (iv) any action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case subject to such Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. However, claims subject to exclusive jurisdiction in the federal courts, such as suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or the rules and regulations thereunder, need not be brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. Stockholders in our company will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation related to choice of forum. The choice of forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees, agents or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Additionally, a court could determine that the exclusive forum provision is unenforceable, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. If a court were to find these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nOur principal executive offices and worldwide headquarters are currently located at 1633 Broadway, New York, New York 10019, under a long-term lease ending July 31, 2029. The lease also includes a single option for us to extend the term for either five years or ten years. In addition, under certain conditions, we have the ability to lease additional space in the building and have a right of first refusal with regard to certain additional space. We also have a lease agreement for office space located in the Ford Factory Building at 777 S. Santa Fe Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90021 for an initial term of 12 years and 9 months with a single option to extend the term of the lease for 10 years, set to initially expire on April 30, 2030. This office space is currently used as our Los Angeles, California headquarters. We also own other property and lease facilities elsewhere throughout the world as necessary to operate our businesses. We consider our properties adequate for our current needs. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nThe Company is involved in various litigation and regulatory proceedings arising in the normal course of business. Where it is determined, in consultation with counsel based on litigation and settlement risks, that a loss is probable and estimable in a given matter, the Company establishes an accrual. In the currently pending proceedings, the amount of accrual is not material. An estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amounts already accrued cannot be made at this time due to various factors typical in contested proceedings, including (1) the results of ongoing discovery; (2) uncertain damage theories and demands; (3) a less than complete factual record; (4) uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or regulators; and (5) the unpredictable nature of the opposing party and its demands. However, the Company cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any litigation or the potential for future litigation. As such, the Company continuously monitors these proceedings as they develop and adjusts any accrual or disclosure as needed. Regardless of the outcome, litigation could have an adverse impact on the Company, including the Companys brand value, because of defense costs, diversion of management resources and other factors and it could have a material effect on the Companys results of operations for a given reporting period. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nPART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nMarket Information for Common Stock\nThe Company's Class A Common Stock began trading on the Nasdaq stock market under the symbol WMG on June 3, 2020. The Company's Class B Common Stock is not listed on any stock exchange nor traded on any public market.\nHolders of Record\nAs of November 15, 2023, there were approximately 15 stockholders of record of the Company's Class A Common Stock. Because many of our shares of Class A Common Stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of individuals and entities, we excluded the total number of beneficial owners represented by these record holders. As of November 15, 2023, there were 8 stockholders of record of our Class B Common Stock.\nDividend Policy\nThe Companys ability to pay dividends may be restricted by covenants in the credit agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility which are currently suspended but which will be reinstated if Acquisition Corp.s Total Indebtedness to EBITDA Ratio increases above 3.50:1.00 and the term loans do not achieve an investment grade rating.\nIn connection with the IPO, the Company amended its dividend policy whereby it intends to pay quarterly cash dividends to holders of its Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. The declaration of each dividend will continue to be at the discretion of the Companys board of directors and will depend on the Companys financial condition, earnings, liquidity and capital requirements, level of indebtedness, contractual restrictions with respect to payment of dividends, restrictions imposed by Delaware law, general business conditions and any other factors that the Companys board of directors deems relevant in making such a determination. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Company will pay any dividends to holders of the Companys common stock, or as to the amount of any such dividends.\nStock Performance Graph\nThis performance graph shall not be deemed to be \"filed\" with the SEC for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.\nThe following graph shows a comparison of the cumulative total return on our Class A Common Stock from June 3, 2020 (the date our Class A Common Stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market) through September 30, 2023 with the cumulative total return of the Standard & Poors 500 Index (S&P 500 Index) and the Nasdaq Composite Index over the same period, assuming the investment of $100 in our Class A Common Stock and in each index on June 3, 2020 and the reinvestment of dividends in each of our Class A Common Stock and each index. The graph uses the closing market price on June 3, 2020 of $30.12 per share as the initial value of our common stock, which had an initial public offering price of $25.00. Through September 30, 2022, the quarterly intervals below are based on the Companys 52-53 week fiscal year in which each reporting period ended on the last Friday of the respective reporting period. Starting with the 2023 fiscal year, the quarterly intervals below are based on the Companys modified fiscal year in which each reporting period ends on the last day of the calendar quarter.\nThe comparisons in the graph below are based on historical data and are not indicative of, nor intended to forecast, future performance of our Class A Common Stock.\n6/3/20 6/26/20 9/25/20 12/24/20 3/26/21 6/25/21 9/24/21 12/31/21 4/1/22 7/1/22 9/30/22 12/31/22 3/31/23 6/30/23 9/30/23\nWarner Music Group Corp. $ 100 $ 102 $ 91 $ 126 $ 114 $ 127 $ 149 $ 148 $ 136 $ 99 $ 95 $ 121 $ 116 $ 91 $ 111\nS&P 500 Index 100 98 108 119 127 134 139 146 141 125 119 123 132 143 137\nNASDAQ Composite Index 100 102 116 129 132 142 149 156 148 125 120 113 136 156 152\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans\nSee Item 12.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis Annual Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those described under Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Company is the direct parent of Holdings, which is the direct parent of Acquisition Corp. Acquisition Corp. is one of the worlds major music entertainment companies.\nThe Company and Holdings are holding companies that conduct substantially all of their business operations through their subsidiaries. The terms we, us, our, ours and the Company refer collectively to Warner Music Group Corp. and its consolidated subsidiaries, except where otherwise indicated.\nManagements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) is provided as a supplement to the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere herein to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of our operations. MD&A is organized as follows:\nBusiness overview. This section provides a general description of our business, as well as a discussion of factors that we believe are important in understanding our results of operations and comparability and in anticipating future trends.\nResults of operations. This section provides an analysis of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021. This analysis is presented on both a consolidated and segment basis.\nFinancial condition and liquidity. This section provides an analysis of our cash flows for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, as well as a discussion of our financial condition and liquidity as of September 30, 2023. The discussion of our financial condition and liquidity includes recent debt financings and a summary of the key debt covenant compliance measures under our debt agreements.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates. This section identifies those accounting policies that are considered important to the Companys results of operations and financial condition, require significant judgment and involve significant management estimates. The Companys significant accounting policies, including those considered to be critical accounting policies, are summarized in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nUse of OIBDA\nWe evaluate our operating performance based on several factors, including our primary financial measure of operating income (loss) before non-cash depreciation of tangible assets and non-cash amortization of intangible assets (OIBDA). We consider OIBDA to be an important indicator of the operational strengths and performance of our businesses. However, a limitation of the use of OIBDA as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our businesses. Accordingly, OIBDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, operating income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Warner Music Group Corp. and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). In addition, our definition of OIBDA may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of consolidated OIBDA to operating income (loss) and net income (loss) attributable to Warner Music Group Corp. is provided in our Results of Operations.\nUse of Constant Currency\nAs exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons, we believe the presentation of revenue and OIBDA on a constant-currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve the ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods. Constant-currency information compares revenue and OIBDA between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We use revenue on a constant-currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance. We calculate constant currency by calculating prior-year revenue using current-year foreign currency exchange rates. We generally refer to such amounts calculated on a constant-currency basis as excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. This revenue should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, revenue reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Revenue on a constant-currency basis, as we present it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nWe are one of the worlds leading music entertainment companies. Our renowned family of iconic record labels, including Atlantic Records, Warner Records, Elektra Records and Parlophone Records, is home to many of the worlds most popular and influential recording artists. In addition, Warner Chappell Music, our global music publishing business, boasts an extraordinary catalog that includes timeless standards and contemporary hits, representing works by over 150,000 songwriters and composers, with a global collection of more than one million musical compositions. We classify our business interests into two fundamental operations: Recorded Music and Music Publishing. A brief description of each of those operations is presented below.\nComponents of Our Operating Results\nRecorded Music Operations\nOur Recorded Music business primarily consists of the discovery and development of recording artists and the related marketing, promotion, distribution, sale and licensing of music created by such recording artists. We play an integral role in virtually all aspects of the recorded music value chain from discovering and developing talent to producing, distributing and selling music to marketing and promoting recording artists and their music.\nIn the United States, our Recorded Music business is conducted principally through our major record labels-Atlantic Records and Warner Records. In October 2018, we launched Elektra Music Group in the United States as a standalone label group, which comprises the Elektra, Fueled by Ramen and Roadrunner labels, and in December 2021, we acquired 300 Entertainment and subsequently launched 300 Elektra Entertainment, or 3EE, a frontline label group that brings together the multi-genre power of 300 Entertainment and Elektra Music Group. Our Recorded Music business also includes Rhino Entertainment, a division that specializes in marketing our recorded music catalog through compilations, reissuances of previously released music and video titles and releasing previously unreleased material from our vault. We also conduct our Recorded Music business through a collection of additional record labels including Asylum, Big Beat, Canvasback, East West, Erato, FFRR, Nonesuch, Parlophone, Reprise, Sire, Spinnin Records, TenThousand Projects, Warner Classics and Warner Music Nashville.\nOutside the United States, our Recorded Music business is conducted in more than 70 countries through various subsidiaries, affiliates and non-affiliated licensees. Internationally, we engage in the same activities as in the United States: discovering and signing artists and distributing, selling, marketing and promoting their music. In most cases, we also market, promote, distribute and sell the music of those recording artists for whom our domestic record labels have international rights. In certain smaller markets, we license the right to distribute and sell our music to non-affiliated third-party record labels.\nOur Recorded Music business operations include WMX, a next generation services division that connects artists with fans and amplifies brands in creative, immersive, and engaging ways. This division includes a rebranded WEA commercial services and marketing network (formerly Warner-Elektra-Atlantic Corporation, or WEA Corp.), which markets, distributes and sells music and video products to retailers and wholesale distributors, as well as acting as the Companys media and creative content arm. Our business distribution operations also includes ADA, which markets, distributes and sells the products of independent labels to retail and wholesale distributors; and various distribution centers and ventures operated internationally.\nIn addition to our music being sold in physical retail outlets, our music is also sold in physical form to online physical retailers, such as amazon.com, barnesandnoble.com and bestbuy.com, and distributed in digital form to an expanded universe of digital partners, including streaming services such as those of Amazon, Apple, Deezer, SoundCloud, Spotify, Tencent Music and YouTube, radio services such as iHeart Radio and SiriusXM and other download services.\nWe have integrated the marketing of digital content into all aspects of our business, including A&R and distribution. Our business development executives work closely with A&R departments to ensure that while music is being produced, digital assets are also created with all distribution channels in mind, including streaming services, social networking sites, online portals and music-\ncentered destinations. We also work side-by-side with our online and mobile partners to test new concepts. We believe existing and new digital businesses will be a significant source of growth and will provide new opportunities to successfully monetize our assets and create new revenue streams. The proportion of digital revenues attributable to each distribution channel varies by region and proportions may change as the introduction of new technologies continues. As one of the worlds largest music entertainment companies, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of growth in digital distribution and emerging technologies to maximize the value of our assets.\nWe have diversified our revenues beyond our traditional businesses by entering into expanded-rights deals with recording artists in order to partner with such artists in other aspects of their careers. Under these agreements, we provide services to and participate in recording artists activities outside the traditional recorded music business such as touring, merchandising and sponsorships. We have built and acquired artist services capabilities and platforms for marketing and distributing this broader set of music-related rights and participating more widely in the monetization of the artist brands we help create. We believe that entering into expanded-rights deals and enhancing our artist services capabilities in areas such as merchandising, VIP ticketing, fan clubs, concert promotion and management has permitted us to diversify revenue streams and capitalize on other revenue opportunities. This provides for improved long-term relationships with our recording artists and allows us to more effectively connect recording artists and fans.\nRecorded Music revenues are derived from four main sources:\nDigital: the rightsholder receives revenues with respect to streaming and download services;\nPhysical: the rightsholder receives revenues with respect to sales of physical products such as vinyl, CDs and DVDs;\nArtist services and expanded-rights: the rightsholder receives revenues with respect to our artist services businesses and our participation in expanded rights, including advertising, merchandising such as direct-to-consumer sales, touring, concert promotion, ticketing, sponsorship, fan clubs, artist websites, social publishing, and artist and brand management; and\nLicensing: the rightsholder receives royalties or fees for the right to use sound recordings in combination with visual images such as in films or television programs, television commercials and video games; the rightsholder also receives royalties if sound recordings are performed publicly through broadcast of music on television, radio and cable, and in public spaces such as shops, workplaces, restaurants, bars and clubs.\nThe principal costs associated with our Recorded Music business are as follows:\nA&R costs: the costs associated with (i) paying royalties to recording artists, producers, songwriters, other copyright holders and trade unions; (ii) signing and developing recording artists; and (iii) creating master recordings in the studio;\nProduct costs: the costs to manufacture, package and distribute products to wholesale and retail distribution outlets, the royalty costs associated with distributing products of independent labels to wholesale and retail distribution outlets, as well as the costs related to our artist services business;\nSelling and marketing expenses: the costs associated with the promotion and marketing of recording artists and music, including costs to produce music videos for promotional purposes and artist tour support; and\nGeneral and administrative expenses: the costs associated with general overhead and other administrative expenses.\nMusic Publishing Operations\nWhile Recorded Music is focused on marketing, promoting, distributing and licensing a particular recording of a musical composition, Music Publishing is an intellectual property business focused on generating revenue from uses of the musical composition itself. In return for promoting, placing, marketing and administering the creative output of a songwriter, or engaging in those activities for other rightsholders, our Music Publishing business shares the revenues generated from use of the musical compositions with the songwriter or other rightsholders.\nThe operations of our Music Publishing business are conducted principally through Warner Chappell Music, our global music publishing company headquartered in Los Angeles, with operations in over 70 countries through various subsidiaries, affiliates, and non-affiliated licensees and sub-publishers. We own or control rights to more than one million musical compositions, including numerous pop hits, American standards, folk songs and motion picture and theatrical compositions. Assembled over decades, our award-winning catalog includes over 150,000 songwriters and composers and a diverse range of genres including pop, rock, jazz, classical, country, R&B, hip-hop, rap, reggae, Latin, folk, blues, symphonic, soul, Broadway, electronic, alternative and gospel. Warner Chappell Music also administers the music and soundtracks of several third-party television and film producers and studios. We have an extensive production music catalog collectively branded as Warner Chappell Production Music.\nMusic Publishing revenues are derived from five main sources:\nDigital: the rightsholder receives revenues with respect to musical compositions embodied in recordings distributed in streaming services, download services, digital performance and other digital music services;\nPerformance: the rightsholder receives revenues if the musical composition is performed publicly through broadcast of music on television, radio and cable and in retail locations (e.g., bars and restaurants), live performance at a concert or other venue (e.g., arena concerts and nightclubs), and performance of music in staged theatrical productions;\nMechanical: the rightsholder receives revenues with respect to musical compositions embodied in recordings sold in any physical format or configuration such as vinyl, CDs and DVDs;\nSynchronization: the rightsholder receives revenues for the right to use the musical composition in combination with visual images such as in films or television programs, television commercials and video games as well as from other uses such as in toys or novelty items and merchandise; and\nOther: the rightsholder receives revenues for use in sheet music and other uses.\nThe principal costs associated with our Music Publishing business are as follows:\nA&R costs: the costs associated with (i) paying royalties to songwriters, co-publishers and other copyright holders in connection with income generated from the uses of their works and (ii) signing and developing songwriters; and\nSelling and marketing, general overhead and other administrative expenses: the costs associated with selling and marketing, general overhead and other administrative expenses.\nRecent Events and Factors Affecting Results of Operations and Comparability\nFiscal Year End\nPrior to the start of the 2023 fiscal year, the Company maintained a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the last Friday in each reporting period. Starting with the 2023 fiscal year, the Company transitioned to a reporting calendar in which the reporting periods end on the last day of the calendar quarter. Accordingly, the results of operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 reflect 365 days, compared to 371 days for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 and 364 days for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the revenue benefit of the additional week was approximately $73 million, primarily reflected in Recorded Music streaming revenue.\nRestructuring\nIn March 2023, the Company announced a restructuring plan (the Restructuring Plan) intended to drive the evolution of the Company and position the Company for long-term growth, primarily through headcount reductions. Under the Restructuring Plan, the Company expects to reduce headcount by approximately 270 people, or approximately 4% of the Companys overall headcount. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized restructuring charges of approximately $40 million for severance costs, all of which will be paid in cash. All restructuring expenses were recorded in the Recorded Music segment. The Restructuring Plan is substantially complete as of September 30, 2023, with related cash expenditures expected to be made by the end of fiscal 2024.\nThe headcount reductions generated pre-tax cost savings of approximately $19 million in fiscal year 2023 and the Company expects to generate pre-tax costs savings of approximately $50 million on an annualized run-rate basis in fiscal year 2024. The Company anticipates investing a portion of the cost savings from the headcount reductions for targeted hires, to add new skill sets and for other initiatives intended to position the Company for long-term growth.\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, in connection with the Restructuring Plan, the Company recognized $2 million of non-cash stock-based compensation related to the accelerated vesting of certain Restricted Stock Units (RSUs).\nExecutive Transition Costs\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred costs associated with the departure of our Chief Executive Officer which occurred in January 2023 and our Chief Financial Officer which occurred in October 2023 (the Executive Transition Costs). For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, the Executive Transition Costs were approximately $7 million, which mainly consisted of severance for our previous CEO and CFO. Such costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nThe departures of our CEO and CFO resulted in the recognition of $13 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, for RSUs and common stock as there is no remaining service required for vesting. Such costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nRussia-Ukraine Conflict\nOn February 24, 2022, the geopolitical situation in Eastern Europe intensified with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the sanctions and other measures imposed in response to this conflict have increased global economic and political uncertainty. WMG operates both its Recorded Music and Music Publishing businesses within Russia and, on March 10, 2022, the Company announced a suspension of these operations in Russia. While our operations in Russia do not constitute a material portion of our business, a significant escalation or expansion of the conflict's current scope, increased or sustained economic disruption, sanctions or countersanctions, further devaluation of the local currency or increased cyber-related disruptions could make it difficult to deliver our content, broaden inflationary costs, and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2023 Compared with Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2022 and Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2021\nConsolidated Results\nRevenues\nThe Companys revenues were composed of the following amounts (in millions):\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 vs. 2022 2022 vs. 2021\n2023 2022 2021 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change\nRevenue by Type\nDigital $ 3,322 $ 3,305 $ 3,105 $ 17 1 % $ 200 6 %\nPhysical 507 563 549 (56) -10 % 14 3 %\nTotal Digital and Physical 3,829 3,868 3,654 (39) -1 % 214 6 %\nArtist services and expanded-rights 744 767 599 (23) -3 % 168 28 %\nLicensing 382 331 291 51 15 % 40 14 %\nTotal Recorded Music 4,955 4,966 4,544 (11) - % 422 9 %\nPerformance 173 159 122 14 9 % 37 30 %\nDigital 669 563 436 106 19 % 127 29 %\nMechanical 63 50 49 13 26 % 1 2 %\nSynchronization 167 172 144 (5) -3 % 28 19 %\nOther 16 14 10 2 14 % 4 40 %\nTotal Music Publishing 1,088 958 761 130 14 % 197 26 %\nIntersegment eliminations (6) (5) (4) (1) 20 % (1) 25 %\nTotal Revenues $ 6,037 $ 5,919 $ 5,301 $ 118 2 % $ 618 12 %\nRevenue by Geographical Location\nU.S. Recorded Music $ 2,184 $ 2,231 $ 1,985 $ (47) -2 % $ 246 12 %\nU.S. Music Publishing 582 513 378 69 13 % 135 36 %\nTotal U.S. 2,766 2,744 2,363 22 1 % 381 16 %\nInternational Recorded Music 2,771 2,735 2,559 36 1 % 176 7 %\nInternational Music Publishing 506 445 383 61 14 % 62 16 %\nTotal International 3,277 3,180 2,942 97 3 % 238 8 %\nIntersegment eliminations (6) (5) (4) (1) 20 % (1) 25 %\nTotal Revenues $ 6,037 $ 5,919 $ 5,301 $ 118 2 % $ 618 12 %\nTotal Revenues\n2023 vs. 2022\nTotal revenues increased by $118 million, or 2%, to $6,037 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 from $5,919 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. The prior fiscal year included an additional week, primarily reflected in Recorded Music streaming revenue, and $38 million in Recorded Music and Music Publishing downloads and other digital revenue from the settlement of certain copyright infringement cases (the Copyright Settlement).

Total streaming revenue increased 5% driven by growth across Recorded Music and Music Publishing. The growth in Music Publishing includes the impact in the year and the prior year of $24 million and $20 million, respectively, resulting from a ruling by the Copyright Royalty Board in Phonorecords III upholding higher percentage revenue of U.S. mechanical royalty rates (the CRB Rate Benefit). Prior to intersegment eliminations, total digital revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 were composed of U.S. revenues of $1,993 million and international revenues of $1,998 million, or 50% of total digital revenues for each of U.S. and international revenues. Prior to intersegment eliminations, total digital revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 were composed of U.S. revenues of $1,983 million and international revenues of $1,885 million, or 51% and 49% of total digital revenues, respectively.\nRecorded Music revenues decreased by $11 million to $4,955 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 from $4,966 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.

Physical revenue decreased by $56 million, or 10%, driven by an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $19 million and a lighter release schedule in the first half of the year. Artist services and expanded-rights revenue decreased by $23 million due to an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $12 million, lower merchandising revenue, primarily direct-to-consumer merchandising revenue at EMP, and lower advertising revenue, partially offset by higher concert promotion revenue. Licensing revenue increased by $51 million, which includes growth across broadcast fees, synchronization and other licensing revenue, partially offset by an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $8 million. Digital revenue increased by $17 million, or 1%, which includes an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $60 million and $31 million in downloads and other digital revenue from the Copyright Settlement in the prior year. Revenue from streaming services grew by $64 million, or 2%, to $3,223 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 from $3,159 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 and was impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates of $57 million, or 2%. Streaming revenue reflects a lighter release schedule and the market-related slowdown in ad-supported revenue in the first half of the year, as well as the impact of an additional week in the prior year. Adjusted for the impact of an additional week in the prior year, Recorded Music streaming revenue increased by 4%. The current year included successful releases from Ed Sheeran, Zach Bryan, Dua Lipa and Bailey Zimmerman. Downloads and other digital revenue decreased by $47 million, or 32%, to $99 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 from $146 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 due to the Copyright Settlement in the prior year and continued shift to streaming services.\nMusic Publishing revenues increased by $130 million, or 14%, to $1,088 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 from $958 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.

International Music Publishing revenues were $506 million and $445 million, or 47% and 46% of Music Publishing revenues, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively.\nThe overall increase in Music Publishing revenue was driven by increases in digital revenue of $106 million, or 19%, performance revenue of $14 million and mechanical revenue of $13 million, partially offset by a decrease in synchronization revenue of $5 million. The increase in digital revenue is primarily due to increases in streaming revenue driven by the continued growth in streaming services, the impact of digital deal renewals, which includes the Companys TikTok renewal, a revenue true-up of $9 million and a $4 million year-over-year increase in the impact of the CRB Rate Benefit, partially offset by $7 million in downloads and other digital revenue from the Copyright Settlement in the prior year and an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchanges rates of $5 million. Revenue from streaming services grew by $117 million, or 22%, to $656 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 from $539 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Performance revenue increased primarily due to continued recovery from COVID disruption in the first half of the year, partially offset by an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $3 million. Mechanical revenue increased from a higher share of physical sales and timing of distributions, partially offset by an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $2 million. The decrease in synchronization revenue is attributable to lower commercial licensing activity and an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $2 million, partially offset by copyright infringement settlements.\n2022 vs. 2021\nTotal revenues increased by $618 million, or 12%, to $5,919 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 from $5,301 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021.

Total digital revenues represented 65% and 67% of consolidated revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively. The decrease in digital revenues as a percentage of total revenue is primarily due to the growth of artist services and expanded-rights revenue.

Revenue from streaming services grew by $187 million, or 6%, to $3,159 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 from $2,972 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021.

Expressed as a percentage of Recorded Music revenue, Recorded Music OIBDA margin remained constant at 21% for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 due to strong operating performance, which was offset by revenue mix resulting from the growth of lower-margin revenue streams and an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates.\nMusic Publishing\nRevenues\n2023 vs. 2022\nMusic Publishing revenues increased by $130 million, or 14%, to $1,088 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 from $958 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.

The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to higher variable compensation expense related to strong operating performance, employee-related costs and legal expenses for the Copyright Settlement, partially offset by lower restructuring costs.

This compares to $3.732 billion of debt (which is net of $41 million of premiums, discounts and deferred financing costs), $584 million of cash and equivalents (net debt of $3.148 billion) and $152 million of Warner Music Group Corp. equity at September 30, 2022.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our historical cash flows (in millions). The financial data for fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 have been derived from our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nCash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 687 $ 742 $ 638\nInvesting activities (300) (824) (638)\nFinancing activities (325) 188 (61)\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities was $687 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to $742 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 and $638 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. The $55 million, or 7%, decrease in cash provided by operating activities during the current year was primarily due to timing of working capital, higher cash interest payments due to higher debt balance and higher interest on variable rate debt and higher cash taxes due to lower available foreign tax credits to shield U.S. taxable income coupled with higher forecasted taxable income.\nThe increase in cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 was primarily due to strong operating performance and timing of working capital.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $300 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to $824 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 and $638 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021.\nCash used in investing activities of $300 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 consisted of $126 million relating to investments and acquisitions of businesses, $114 million to acquire music-related assets, and $127 million relating to capital expenditures, partially offset by $45 million of proceeds from divestitures and $22 million of proceeds from the sale of investments.\nCash used in investing activities of $824 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 consisted of $509 million relating to investments and acquisitions of businesses, a portion of which was debt-financed, $191 million to acquire music-related assets, a portion of which was debt-financed, and $135 million relating to capital expenditures, partially offset by $11 million of proceeds from the sale of investments.\nCash used in investing activities of $638 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 consisted of $64 million relating to investments and acquisitions of businesses, $93 million relating to capital expenditures and $481 million to acquire music-related assets, a portion of which was debt-financed.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities was $325 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $188 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 and cash used in financing activities of $61 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021.\nThe $325 million of cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 consisted of cash paid to settle deferred consideration related to prior year acquisitions of music publishing rights and music catalogs of $133 million, repayment of Senior Term Loan Facility Tranche H loans of $150 million, dividends paid of $340 million, deferred financing costs of $3 million, distributions to noncontrolling interest holders of $12 million, redemption of noncontrolling interest of $1 million and repayment of Term Loan Mortgage of $1 million, partially offset by proceeds from the Senior Term Loan Facility Tranche G loans of $149 million, proceeds from the Senior Term Loan Facility Tranche H loans of $147 million and proceeds from the Term Loan Mortgage of $19 million.\nThe $188 million of cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 consisted of proceeds from debt issuance of $535 million, which was used to fund the acquisition of a business and music-related assets, partially offset by dividends paid of $318 million, taxes paid related to net share settlement of restricted stock units of $6 million, deferred financing costs of $5 million, cash paid to settle deferred and contingent consideration of $7 million, distributions to noncontrolling interest holders of $6 million and other for $5 million.\nThe $61 million of cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 consisted of the redemption of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of $325 million of the 5.500% Senior Notes due 2026, the redemption of the 3.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2026 of $524 million, dividends paid of $265 million, call premiums paid on early redemption of debt of $21 million, deferred financing costs of $12 million and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders of $7 million, partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of the 3.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2031 of $244 million which was used to fund the acquisition of music-related assets, proceeds from the issuance of the 2.250% Senior Secured Notes due 2031 of $524 million, and proceeds from the increase supplement to the Senior Term Loan Facility of $325 million.\nThere were no drawdowns on the Revolving Credit Facility during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021.\nLiquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated from our subsidiaries operations, available cash and equivalents and funds available for drawing under our Revolving Credit Facility. These sources of liquidity are needed to fund our debt service requirements, working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, strategic acquisitions and investments, and dividends, prepayments of debt, repurchases or retirement of our outstanding debt or notes or repurchases of our outstanding equity securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases or otherwise, we may elect to pay or make in the future. We maintain our cash in various banks and other financial institutions around the world, and in some cases those cash deposits are in excess of FDIC or other deposit insurance. In the event of a bank failure or receivership, we may not have access to those cash deposits in excess of the relevant deposit insurance, which could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and financial performance.\nWe believe that our primary sources of liquidity will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next twelve months.\nWe are continuing our financial transformation initiative, launched in August 2019, to upgrade our information technology and finance infrastructure, including related systems and processes, for which we currently expect upfront costs to be approximately $235 million, which includes capital expenditures of approximately $100 million. The timing of global deployment has been delayed as the size and scale of this global system implementation requires rigorous system testing and data validation to ensure go-live readiness. To address these implementation requirements, we are deploying our new technology platform in a wave-based approach. In 2023, we successfully launched certain components of our new technology platform in select territories in two successful waves in April and August and will continue to deploy the platform to remaining territories through fiscal year 2024 and into fiscal year 2025. Annualized run-rate savings from the financial transformation initiative are expected to be between approximately $35 million and $40 million, once fully implemented and we expect to achieve benefits through the implementation of the platform including process and data standardization, improved security and compliance, operational efficiencies and enhanced productivity. We expect that our primary sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund these expenditures.\nDebt Capital Structure\nSince Access acquired us in 2011, we have sought to extend the maturity dates on our outstanding indebtedness, reduce interest expense and improve our debt ratings. For example, our S&P corporate credit rating improved from B in 2017 to BB+ in July 2021 with a stable outlook, and our Moodys corporate family rating improved from B1 in 2016 to Ba2 in April 2023. In addition, our weighted-average interest rate on our outstanding indebtedness has decreased from 10.5% in 2011 to 4.1% as of September 30, 2023. Our nearest-term maturity date is in 2028. Subject to market conditions, we expect to continue to take opportunistic steps to extend our maturity dates and reduce related interest expense. From time to time, we may incur additional indebtedness for, among other things, working capital, repurchasing, redeeming or tendering for existing indebtedness and acquisitions or other strategic transactions.\nTerm Loan Mortgage Agreement\nOn January 27, 2023, Acquisition Corp., along with Warner Records Inc. and Warner Music Inc., entered into an agreement with Truist Bank, which provides for a term loan of $19 million (Term Loan Mortgage) secured by the Companys real estate properties in Nashville, Tennessee. Interest on the Term Loan Mortgage will accrue at a rate of 30-day Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus the applicable margin of 1.40% subject to a zero floor. Equal principal installments and interest are due monthly.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn January 31, 2018, Acquisition Corp. entered into the revolving credit agreement (as amended by the amendment dated October 9, 2019 and as further amended, amended and restated or otherwise modified from time to time, the Revolving Credit Agreement) for a senior secured revolving credit facility with Credit Suisse AG, as administrative agent, and the other financial institutions and lenders from time to time party thereto (the Revolving Credit Facility). On April 3, 2020, Acquisition Corp. entered into an amendment to the Revolving Credit Agreement (the Second Amendment) which, among other things, increased the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility from an aggregate principal amount of $180 million to an aggregate principal amount of $300 million and extended the final maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility from January 31, 2023 to April 3, 2025. For a more detailed description of the changes effected by the Second Amendment, see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nOn March 1, 2021, Acquisition Corp. entered into an amendment (the Revolving Credit Agreement Amendment) to the Revolving Credit Agreement among Acquisition Corp., the several banks and other financial institutions party thereto and Credit Suisse AG, as administrative agent, governing Acquisition Corp.s revolving credit facility with Credit Suisse AG, as administrative agent, and the other financial institutions and lenders from time to time party thereto. The Revolving Credit Agreement Amendment (among other changes) adds certain exceptions and increases the leverage ratio below which Acquisition Corp. can access certain baskets in connection with Acquisition Corp.s negative covenants, including those related to incurrence of indebtedness, restricted payments and covenant suspension.\nOn March 23, 2023, Acquisition Corp. entered into an amendment (the Fourth Revolving Credit Agreement Amendment) to the Revolving Credit Agreement among Acquisition Corp. and Credit Suisse AG, as administrative agent, governing Acquisition Corp.s revolving credit facility with Credit Suisse AG, as administrative agent, and the other financial institutions and lenders from time to time party thereto. The Fourth Revolving Credit Agreement Amendment provides for the replacement of LIBOR-based rates with a SOFR-based rate and other rates for alternate currencies, such as EURIBOR and SONIA. We utilized the expedients set forth in FASB Topic 848, Reference Rate Reform (ASC 848) including those relating to derivative instruments used in hedging relationships. This transition does not result in a financial impact to our consolidated financial statements.\nAcquisition Corp. is the borrower under the Revolving Credit Agreement which provides for a revolving credit facility in the amount of up to $300 million and includes a $90 million letter of credit sub-facility. Amounts are available under the Revolving Credit Facility in U.S. dollars, euros or pounds sterling. The Revolving Credit Agreement permits loans for general corporate purposes and may also be utilized to issue letters of credit. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at Acquisition Corp.s election at a rate equal to (i) the rate for deposits in the borrowing currency in the London interbank market (adjusted for maximum reserves) for the applicable interest period (Revolving SOFR) plus 1.875% per annum, or (ii) the base rate, which is the highest of (x) the corporate base rate established by the administrative agent from time to time, (y) the overnight federal funds rate plus 0.5% and (z) the one-month Revolving SOFR plus 1.00% per annum, plus, in each case, 0.875% per annum; provided that, for each of clauses (i) and (ii), the applicable margin with respect to such loans is subject to adjustment upon achievement of certain leverage ratios as set forth in a leverage-based pricing grid in the Revolving Credit Agreement. Based on the Senior Secured Indebtedness to EBITDA Ratio of 2.84x at September 30, 2023, the applicable margin for Eurodollar loans would be 1.375% instead of 1.875% and the applicable margin for ABR loans would be 0.375% instead of 0.875% in the case of 2020 Revolving Loans (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement).\nPrepayments\nIf, at any time, the aggregate amount of outstanding loans (including letters of credit outstanding thereunder) exceeds the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, prepayments of the loans (and after giving effect to such prepayment the cash collateralization of letters of credit) will be required in an amount equal to such excess. The application of proceeds from mandatory prepayments shall not reduce the aggregate amount of then effective commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility and amounts prepaid may be reborrowed, subject to then effective commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nVoluntary reductions of the unutilized portion of the Commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility are permitted at any time in certain minimum principal amounts, without premium or penalty. Voluntary prepayments of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are permitted at any time in certain minimum principal amounts, subject to reimbursement of the lenders redeployment costs actually incurred in the case of a prepayment of SOFR-based borrowings other than on the last day of the relevant interest period.\nSenior Term Loan Facility\nAcquisition Corp. is party to a $1,145 million senior secured term loan credit facility, pursuant to a credit agreement dated November 1, 2012, as amended or supplemented (the Senior Term Loan Credit Agreement) with Credit Suisse AG, as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the other financial institutions and lenders from time to time party thereto (as described below, the Senior Term Loan Facility and, together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Credit Facilities).\nOn January 20, 2021, Acquisition Corp. entered into an amendment (the Senior Term Loan Credit Agreement Amendment) to the Senior Term Loan Credit Agreement. The Senior Term Loan Credit Agreement Amendment (among other changes) (i) extends the maturity date of its outstanding term loans from November 1, 2023 to January 20, 2028 and (ii) removes a number of negative covenants limiting the ability of Acquisition Corp. to take various actions. The remaining negative covenants are limited to restrictions on liens, restrictions on fundamental changes and change of control, and are in a form substantially similar to the negative covenants in the 2.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2028, 3.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2030, 3.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2031 and 2.250% Senior Secured Notes due 2031.\nOn April 14, 2021, Acquisition Corp. borrowed additional term loans in an amount of $325 million under the Increase Supplement as described further in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. The Increase Supplement was entered into to provide for the redemption of Acquisition Corp.s 5.500% Senior Notes due 2026. Following such borrowing, there was an aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Senior Term Loan Credit Agreement of $1,145 million.\nOn November 1, 2022, Acquisition Corp. entered into a Seventh Incremental Commitment Amendment (the Seventh Incremental Commitment Amendment) to the Senior Term Loan Credit Agreement, pursuant to which Acquisition Corp. borrowed additional term loans in the amount of $150 million for an aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Senior Term Loan Credit Agreement of $1,295 million.\nOn May 10, 2023, Acquisition Corp. entered into an amendment (the Senior Term Loan Credit Agreement Amendment) to the Senior Term Loan Credit Agreement among Acquisition Corp., the guarantors party thereto and Credit Suisse AG, as administrative agent. The Senior Term Loan Credit Agreement Amendment provides for the replacement of LIBOR-based rates with a SOFR-based rate. We utilized the expedients set forth in ASC 848, including those relating to derivative instruments used in hedging relationships. This transition does not result in a financial impact to our consolidated financial statements.\nOn June 30, 2023, Acquisition Corp. entered into an increase supplement (the Third Increase Supplement) to the Senior Term Loan Credit Agreement among Acquisition Corp., the guarantors party thereto, the lender party thereto and Credit Suisse AG, as administrative agent, pursuant to which Acquisition Corp. has borrowed additional Tranche G term loans in an amount equal to $150 million, the proceeds of which have been used to prepay the Tranche H term loans in full (see Senior Term Loan Facility Amendment), for an aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Senior Term Loan Credit Agreement of $1,295 million. The Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, which represents the remaining unamortized discount and deferred financing costs of the Tranche H term loan.\nGeneral\nAcquisition Corp. is the borrower under the Senior Term Loan Facility (the Term Loan Borrower). The loans outstanding under the Senior Term Loan Facility mature on January 20, 2028.\nIn addition, the Senior Term Loan Credit Agreement provides the right for individual lenders to extend the maturity date of their loans upon the request of the Term Loan Borrower and without the consent of any other lender.\nSubject to certain conditions, without the consent of the then existing lenders (but subject to the receipt of commitments), the Senior Term Loan Facility may be expanded (or a new term loan facility entered into) by up to the greater of (i) $300 million and (ii) such additional amount as would not cause the net senior secured leverage ratio, after giving effect to the incurrence of such additional amount and any use of proceeds thereof, to exceed 4.50:1.00.\nInterest Rates and Fees\nTerm loan borrowings under the Senior Term Loan Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate measured by reference to, at Acquisition Corp.s option, either (i) an adjusted scheduled overnight financing rate, SOFR, not less than 0.00% per annum plus a borrowing margin of 2.125% per annum or (ii) an alternative base rate plus a borrowing margin of 1.125% per annum.\nPrepayments\nThe Senior Term Loan Facility is subject to mandatory prepayment and reduction in an amount equal to (a) 50% of excess cash flow (as defined in the Senior Term Loan Credit Agreement), with reductions to 25% and zero based upon achievement of a net senior secured leverage ratio of less than or equal to 4.50:1.00 or 4.00:1.00, respectively, (b) 100% of the net cash proceeds received from the incurrence of indebtedness by the Term Loan Borrower or any of its restricted subsidiaries (other than indebtedness permitted under the Senior Term Loan Facility) and (c) 100% of the net cash proceeds of all non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of property by the Term Loan Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries (including certain insurance and condemnation proceeds) in excess of $75 million and subject to the right of the Term Loan Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries to reinvest such proceeds within a specified period of time, and other exceptions. Voluntary prepayments of borrowings under the Senior Term Loan Facility are permitted at any time, in minimum principal amounts of $1 million or a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof, subject to reimbursement of the lenders redeployment costs actually incurred in the case of a prepayment of adjusted SOFR borrowings other than on the last day of the relevant interest period.\nSecured Notes\n3.875% Senior Secured Notes\nOn June 29, 2020, Acquisition Corp. issued $535 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.875% Senior Secured Notes under the Indenture, dated June 29, 2020 (the Senior Secured Base Indenture), among Acquisition Corp., the guarantors party thereto, Credit Suisse AG, as Notes Authorized Representative and Collateral Agent and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture (the 3.875% Supplemental Indenture).\nAt any time prior to July 15, 2025, the 3.875% Senior Secured Notes may be redeemed at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 3.875% Senior Secured Notes redeemed plus the applicable make-whole premium (the Make-Whole Redemption) set forth in the Secured Notes Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the applicable redemption date in accordance with the 3.875% Supplemental Indenture.

Additionally, during any twelve month period prior to August 15, 2026, the 2.250% Senior Secured Notes may be redeemed pursuant to a Secured Notes Redemption at 101.125%.\n3.750% Senior Secured Notes\nOn November 17, 2021, Acquisition Corp. priced $540 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2029 (the 3.750% Senior Secured Notes, together with the 3.875% Senior Secured Notes, the 2.750% Senior Secured Notes, the 3.000% Senior Secured Notes and the 2.250% Senior Secured Notes, the Secured Notes). We issued the 3.750% Senior Secured Notes on November 24, 2021 under the Senior Secured Base Indenture, as supplemented by the Sixth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of November 24, 2021, among Acquisition Corp., the guarantors party thereto and the Trustee (the 3.750% Supplemental Indenture, together with the Senior Secured Base Indenture, the 3.875% Supplemental Indenture, the 2.750% Supplemental Indenture, the 3.000% Supplemental Indenture and the 2.250% Supplemental Indenture, the Secured Notes Indenture).\nAt any time on one or more occasions on or prior to the fifth business day following December 20, 2021 by giving notice at least five business days prior to such time, Acquisition Corp. may elect to redeem all or a portion of the 3.750% Senior Secured Notes at a special optional redemption price equal to the issue price of the 3.750% Senior Secured Notes plus 1% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date, provided, that Acquisition Corp. may only elect to redeem fewer than all of the 3.750% Senior Secured Notes, if, after giving effect to any such redemption, at least $250 million aggregate principal amount of the 3.750% Senior Secured Notes remains outstanding following such special optional redemption.\nAt any time prior to December 1, 2024, the 3.750% Senior Secured Notes may be redeemed pursuant to a Make-Whole Redemption in accordance with the 3.750% Supplemental Indenture. Additionally, at any time prior to December 1, 2024, the 3.750% Senior Secured Notes may be redeemed pursuant to an Equity Redemption at a redemption price equal to 103.750% of the principal\namount of the 3.750% Senior Secured Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, subject to the same provisos as the 3.875% Senior Secured Notes Equity Redemption.

Additionally, during any twelve month period prior to December 1, 2024, the 3.750% Senior Secured Notes may be redeemed pursuant to a Secured Notes Redemption.\nGeneral Terms of Our Indebtedness\nCertain terms of the Senior Credit Facilities and certain terms of each series of notes under our Secured Notes Indenture are described below.\nRanking\nThe indebtedness incurred pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility and the Senior Term Loan Facility and the Secured Notes are Acquisition Corp.s senior secured obligations and are secured on an equal and ratable basis with all existing and future indebtedness secured with the same security arrangements. The Secured Notes rank senior in right of payment to Acquisition Corp.s existing and future subordinated indebtedness; rank equally in right of payment with all of Acquisition Corp.s existing and future senior indebtedness and any future senior secured credit facility; are effectively senior to Acquisition Corp.s unsecured senior indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the senior secured obligations; and are structurally subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of any of Acquisition Corp.s non-guarantor subsidiaries (other than indebtedness and liabilities owed to Acquisition Corp. or one of its subsidiary guarantors (as such term is defined below)).\nGuarantees and Security\nThe obligations under each of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Term Loan Facility and the Secured Notes Indenture are guaranteed by each direct and indirect U.S. restricted subsidiary of Acquisition Corp., other than certain excluded subsidiaries. All obligations of Acquisition Corp. and each guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Term Loan Facility and the Secured Notes Indenture are secured by substantially all the assets of Acquisition Corp and each subsidiary guarantor.\nCovenants, Representations and Warranties\nThe Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Term Loan Facility and the Secured Notes contain customary representations and warranties and certain affirmative and negative covenants. The negative covenants applicable to securities issued pursuant to the Secured Notes Indenture, Senior Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility limit the ability of Acquisition Corp. and its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, create liens and consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets. In addition, our Revolving Credit Facility includes additional covenants, which are incurrence-based high yield covenants and limit the ability of Acquisition Corp. and its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares; pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions; repurchase, prepay or redeem subordinated indebtedness; make investments; create restrictions on the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends to it or make other intercompany transfers; transfer or sell assets; enter into certain transactions with its affiliates; and designate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. These additional covenants are currently suspended. These covenants will be reinstated if Acquisition Corp.s Total Indebtedness to EBITDA Ratio increases above 3.50:1.00 and the term loans do not achieve an investment grade rating.\nThe negative covenants are subject to customary exceptions. There are no financial covenants included in the Revolving Credit Agreement, other than a springing leverage ratio of 5.00:1.00 (with no step-down), which is not tested, unless at the end of a fiscal quarter the outstanding amount of loans and drawings under letters of credit which have not been reimbursed exceeds $105 million. There are no financial covenants included in the Senior Term Loan Credit Agreement or the Secured Notes Indenture.\nEvents of Default\nEvents of default under the Revolving Credit Facility, the New Senior Term Loan Facility and the Secured Notes Indenture include, as applicable, nonpayment of principal when due, nonpayment of interest or other amounts, inaccuracy of representations or warranties in any material respect, violation of covenants, cross default and cross acceleration to other material debt, certain bankruptcy or insolvency events, certain ERISA events, certain material judgments, actual or asserted invalidity of security interests in excess of $50 million, or $75 million in the case of the Secured Notes Indenture, in each case subject to customary thresholds, notice and grace period provisions.\nChange of Control\nUpon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event, which is defined in the Secured Notes Indenture, each holder of the Secured Notes has the right to require Acquisition Corp. to repurchase some or all of such holders Secured Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.\nExisting Debt as of September 30, 2023\nAs of September 30, 2023, our long-term debt, all of which was issued by Acquisition Corp., was as follows (in millions):\nRevolving Credit Facility (a) $ -\nSenior Term Loan Facility due 2028 1,295\n2.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (\u20ac325 face amount)\n3.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2029\n3.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2030\n2.250% Senior Secured Notes due 2031 (\u20ac445 face amount)\n3.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2031\nTerm Loan Mortgage\nTotal long-term debt, including the current portion $ 4,002\nIssuance premium less unamortized discount and unamortized deferred financing costs (38)\nTotal long-term debt, including the current portion, net $ 3,964\n______________________________________\n(a)Reflects $300 million of commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, less letters of credit outstanding of approximately $2 million at September 30, 2023. There were no loans outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at September 30, 2023.\nDividends\nThe Companys ability to pay dividends may be restricted by covenants in the credit agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility which are currently suspended but which will be reinstated if Acquisition Corp.s Total Indebtedness to EBITDA Ratio increases above 3.50:1.00 and the term loans do not achieve an investment grade rating.\nThe Company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends to holders of its Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. The declaration of each dividend will continue to be at the discretion of the Companys board of directors and will depend on the Companys financial condition, earnings, liquidity and capital requirements, level of indebtedness, contractual restrictions with respect to payment of dividends, restrictions imposed by Delaware law, general business conditions and any other factors that the Companys board of directors deems relevant in making such a determination. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Company will pay any dividends to holders of the Companys common stock, or as to the amount of any such dividends.\nOn August 14, 2023, the Companys board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.17 per share on the Companys Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, as well as related payments under certain stock-based compensation plans, which was paid on September 1, 2023.\nThe Company paid cash dividends to stockholders and participating security holders of $340 million, $318 million and $265 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nCovenant Compliance\nThe Company was in compliance with its covenants under its outstanding notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Senior Term Loan Facility as of September 30, 2023.\nOn January 18, 2019, we delivered a notice to the trustee under the 2012 Secured Indenture and 2014 Unsecured Indenture changing the Fixed GAAP Date, as defined under the indentures, to October 1, 2018. Under the Senior Term Loan Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Secured Notes Indenture, the Fixed GAAP Date is set for April 3, 2020, other than in respect of capital leases, which are frozen at November 1, 2012.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility contains a springing leverage ratio that is tied to a ratio based on EBITDA, which is defined under the Revolving Credit Agreement. Our ability to borrow funds under the Revolving Credit Facility may depend upon our ability\nto meet the leverage ratio test at the end of a fiscal quarter to the extent we have drawn a certain amount of revolving loans. On May 4, 2021, certain covenants set forth in our Revolving Credit Facility were suspended, including the restriction on incurring certain additional indebtedness, based on the determination that the total indebtedness to EBITDA ratio is below the required threshold specified therein. EBITDA as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility is based on Consolidated Net Income (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility), both of which terms differ from the terms EBITDA and net income as they are commonly used. For example, the calculation of EBITDA under the Revolving Credit Facility, in addition to adjusting net income to exclude interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization, also adjusts net income by excluding items or expenses such as, among other items, (1) the amount of any restructuring charges or reserves; (2) any non-cash charges (including any impairment charges); (3) any net loss resulting from hedging currency exchange risks; (4) the amount of management, monitoring, consulting and advisory fees paid to Access; (5) business optimization expenses (including consolidation initiatives, severance costs and other costs relating to initiatives aimed at profitability improvement); (6) transaction expenses; (7) equity-based compensation expense; and (8) certain extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring items. The definition of EBITDA under the Revolving Credit Facility also includes adjustments for the pro forma impact of certain projected cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies and any quality of earnings analysis prepared by independent certified public accountants in connection with an acquisition, merger, consolidation or other investment. The Senior Term Loan Facility and the Secured Notes Indenture use financial measures called Consolidated EBITDA or EBITDA and Consolidated Net Income that have substantially the same definitions to EBITDA and Consolidated Net Income, each as defined under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nEBITDA as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility (referred to in this section as Adjusted EBITDA) is presented herein because it is a material component of the leverage ratio contained in the Revolving Credit Agreement. Non-compliance with the leverage ratio could result in the inability to use the Revolving Credit Facility, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flow. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent net income or cash from operating activities as those terms are defined by U.S. GAAP and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. While Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements, these terms are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation. Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters that we may consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations. In particular, the definition of Adjusted EBITDA in the Revolving Credit Agreement allows us to add back certain non-cash, extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring charges that are deducted in calculating net income. However, these are expenses that may recur, vary greatly and are difficult to predict.\nAdjusted EBITDA as presented below should not be used by investors as an indicator of performance for any future period. Further, our debt instruments require that it be calculated for the most recent four fiscal quarters. As a result, the measure can be disproportionately affected by a particularly strong or weak quarter. Further, it may not be comparable to the measure for any subsequent four quarter period or any complete fiscal year. In addition, our debt instruments require that the leverage ratio be calculated on a pro forma basis for certain transactions including acquisitions as if such transactions had occurred on the first date of the measurement period and may include expected cost savings and synergies resulting from or related to any such transaction. There can be no assurances that any such cost savings or synergies will be achieved in full.\nIn addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by our management to understand and evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of those limitations include: (1) it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenue for our business; (2) it does not reflect the significant interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness; and (3) it does not reflect every cash expenditure, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. In particular, this measure adds back certain non-cash, extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring charges that are deducted in calculating net income; however, these are expenses that may recur, vary greatly and are difficult to predict. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not the same as net income or cash flow provided by operating activities as those terms are defined by U.S. GAAP and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income (loss) and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income, which is a U.S. GAAP measure of our operating results, to Adjusted EBITDA as defined, for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters, or the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 and for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022. In addition, the reconciliation includes the calculation of the Senior Secured Indebtedness to Adjusted EBITDA ratio, which we refer to as the Leverage Ratio, under the Revolving Credit Agreement for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters, or the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. The terms and related calculations are defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement. All amounts in the reconciliation below reflect Acquisition Corp. (in millions, except ratios):\nTwelve Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nNet Income $ 439 $ 555 $ 154 $ 150\nIncome tax expense 170 185 58 37\nInterest expense, net 141 125 36 31\nDepreciation and amortization 332 339 79 82\nLoss on extinguishment of debt (a) 4 - - -\nNet losses (gains) on divestitures and sale of securities (b) (42) 9 - -\nRestructuring costs (c) 58 22 9 11\nNet hedging and foreign exchange (gains) losses (d) 43 (195) (37) (67)\nTransaction costs (e) 3 8 3 -\nBusiness optimization expenses (f) 68 54 24 11\nNon-cash stock-based compensation expense (g) 49 39 8 5\nOther non-cash charges (h) - 23 (1) 11\nPro forma impact of cost savings initiatives and specified transactions (i) 46 32 7 5\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 1,311 $ 1,196 $ 340 $ 276\nSenior Secured Indebtedness (j) $ 3,726\nLeverage Ratio (k) 2.84x\n______________________________________\n(a)Reflects loss on extinguishment of debt, primarily including tender fees and unamortized deferred financing costs.\n(b)Reflects net losses (gains) on sale of securities and divestitures.\n(c)Reflects severance costs and other restructuring related expenses.\n(d)Reflects unrealized losses (gains) due to foreign exchange on our Euro-denominated debt, losses (gains) from hedging activities and intercompany transactions.\n(e)Reflects mainly transaction related costs.\n(f)Reflects costs associated with our transformation initiatives and IT system updates, which includes costs of $14 million and $48 million related to our finance transformation and other related costs for the three and twelve months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, as well as $9 million and $40 million for the three and twelve months ended September 30, 2022, respectively.\n(g)Reflects non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to the Omnibus Incentive Plan and the Warner Music Group Corp. Senior Management Free Cash Flow Plan.\n(h)Reflects non-cash activity, including the unrealized losses (gains) on the mark-to-market adjustment of equity investments, investment losses (gains), mark-to-market adjustments of an earn-out liability in 2022 and other non-cash impairments.\n(i)Reflects expected savings resulting from transformation initiatives and the pro forma impact of certain specified transactions for the three and twelve months ended September 30, 2023. Certain of these cost savings initiatives and transactions impacted quarters prior to the quarter during which they were identified within the last twelve-month period. The pro forma impact of these specified transactions and initiatives resulted in a $2 million increase in the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 Adjusted EBITDA.\n(j)Reflects primarily the balance of senior secured debt at Acquisition Corp. of approximately $3.964 billion and less cash of $250 million.\n(k)Reflects the ratio of Senior Secured Indebtedness, including Revolving Credit Agreement Indebtedness, to Adjusted EBITDA. This is calculated net of cash and equivalents of the Company as of September 30, 2023 not exceeding $250 million. If the outstanding aggregate principal amount of borrowings and drawings under letters of credit which have not been reimbursed under our Revolving Credit Facility is greater than $105 million at the end of a fiscal quarter, the maximum leverage ratio permitted under the Revolving Credit Facility is 5.00:1.00. The Companys Revolving Credit Facility does not impose any leverage ratio maintenance requirement on the Company when the aggregate principal amount of borrowings and drawings under letters of credit, which have not been reimbursed under the Revolving Credit Facility, is less than or equal to $105 million at the end of a fiscal quarter. On May 4, 2021, certain covenants set forth in our Revolving Credit\nFacility were suspended, including the restriction on incurring certain additional indebtedness, based on the determination that the total indebtedness to EBITDA ratio is below the required threshold specified therein.\nSummary\nManagement believes that funds generated from our operations and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and available cash and equivalents will be sufficient to fund our debt service requirements, working capital requirements and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future. We also have additional borrowing capacity under our indentures and the Senior Term Loan Facility. However, our ability to continue to fund these items and to reduce debt may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, as well as other industry-specific factors such as the ability to control music piracy and the continued transition from physical to digital formats in the recorded music and music publishing industries. It could also be affected by the severity and duration of geopolitical conflicts or natural or man-made disasters, including pandemics such as COVID-19. We and our affiliates continue to evaluate opportunities to, from time to time, depending on market conditions and prices, contractual restrictions, our financial liquidity and other factors, seek to pay dividends or prepay outstanding debt or repurchase or retire Acquisition Corp.s outstanding debt or debt securities or repurchase our outstanding equity securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases or otherwise. The amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material and may be funded from available cash or from additional borrowings. In addition, from time to time, depending on market conditions and prices, contractual restrictions, our financial liquidity and other factors, we may seek to refinance the Senior Credit Facilities or our outstanding debt or debt securities with existing cash and/or with funds provided from additional borrowings.\nContractual and Other Obligations\nFirm Commitments\nThe following table summarizes the Companys aggregate contractual obligations at September 30, 2023, and the estimated timing and effect that such obligations are expected to have on the Companys liquidity and cash flow in future periods.\nFirm Commitments and Outstanding Debt Less than\n1 year 1-3\nyears 3-5\nyears After 5\nyears Total\n(in millions)\nSenior Secured Notes (1) $ - $ - $ 343 $ 2,346 $ 2,689\nInterest on Senior Secured Notes (1) 85 170 170 164 589\nSenior Term Loan Facility (1) - - 1,295 - 1,295\nInterest on Senior Term Loan Facility (1) 97 163 100 - 360\nTerm Loan Mortgage (1)\n- - - 18 18\nInterest on Term Loan Mortgage (1)\n1 2 2 3 8\nOperating leases (2) 56 104 98 104 362\nArtist, songwriter and co-publisher commitments (3) 383 * * * 383\nMinimum funding commitments to investees and other obligations (4) 18 27 1 - 46\nTotal firm commitments and outstanding debt $ 640 $ 466 $ 2,009 $ 2,635 $ 5,750\n______________________________________\nThe following is a description of our firmly committed contractual obligations at September 30, 2023:\n(1)Outstanding debt obligations consist of the Senior Secured Notes, Senior Term Loan Facility and the Term Loan Mortgage. These obligations have been presented based on the principal amounts due as of September 30, 2023. Amounts do not include any fair value adjustments, bond premiums, discounts or unamortized deferred financing costs.\n(2)Operating lease obligations primarily relate to the minimum lease rental obligations for our real estate and operating equipment in various locations around the world.\n(3)The Company routinely enters into long-term commitments with recording artists, songwriters and publishers for the future delivery of music. Such commitments generally become due only upon delivery and Company acceptance of albums from the recording artists or future musical compositions from songwriters and publishers. Additionally, such commitments are typically cancellable at the Companys discretion, generally without penalty. Based on contractual obligations and the Companys expected release schedule, off-balance sheet aggregate firm commitments to such talent approximated $383 million at September 30, 2023. The aggregate firm commitments expected for the next twelve-month period based on contractual obligations and the Companys expected release schedule approximates $236 million at September 30, 2023.\n(4)We have minimum funding commitments and other related obligations to support the operations of various investments, which are reflected in the table above. Other long-term liabilities, which are not included in the table above, include $13 million and $8 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. We are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released.\n*Because the timing of payment, and even whether payment occurs, is dependent upon the timing of delivery of albums and musical compositions, the timing and amount of payment of these commitments as presented in the above summary can vary significantly.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe SECs Financial Reporting Release No. 60, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies (FRR 60), suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical. FRR 60 considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results, and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in our application. We believe the following list represents critical accounting policies as contemplated by FRR 60. For a summary of all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for our business acquisitions under the FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805) guidance for business combinations. The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying identifiable net assets based on their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and often involves the use of estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. If our assumptions or estimates in the fair value calculation change based on information that becomes available during the one-year period from the acquisition date, the fair value of our acquired intangible assets could change; this would also change the value of our goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nAccounting for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nWe account for our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as required by FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (ASC 350). We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and have concluded that our reporting units are generally the same as our reportable segments. We evaluate the determination of our reporting units periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur. ASC 350 requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques on an annual basis and when events occur that may suggest that the fair value of such assets cannot support the carrying value. ASC 350 gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, then performing the quantitative impairment test is unnecessary. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then the quantitative impairment test shall be used to identify the impairment and measure the amount of an impairment loss to be recognized (if applicable).\nAs of September 30, 2023, we had recorded goodwill in the amount of $1.993 billion, including $1.529 billion and $464 million for our Recorded Music and Music Publishing businesses, respectively, primarily related to the Merger and PLG Acquisition. As of September 30, 2023, we had recorded indefinite-lived intangible assets of $149 million. We test our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year as of July 1. We performed a qualitative assessment for our reporting units and other indefinite-lived intangible assets in fiscal 2023. This assessment considered changes in our projected future cash flows and discount rates, recent market transactions and overall macroeconomic conditions. Based on this assessment, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our reporting units and other indefinite-lived intangible assets were higher than their carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not required.\nSee Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our goodwill and intangible assets.\nRevenue and Cost Recognition\nRevenues\nRecorded Music\nAs required by FASB ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606), the Company recognizes revenue when, or as, control of the promised services or goods is transferred to our customers and in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company is contractually due in exchange for those services or goods. The Companys revenue recognition process involves several applications that are responsible for the initiation and processing of transactions in order to recognize revenue in accordance with the Companys policy and ASC 606.\nRevenues from the sale or license of Recorded Music products through digital distribution channels are typically recognized when sale or usage occurs based on usage reports received from the customer. Certain contracts contain minimum guarantees, which are recoupable against royalties. Upon contract inception, the Company will assess whether a shortfall or breakage is expected (i.e., where the minimum guarantee will not be recouped through royalties) in order to determine timing of revenue recognition for the minimum guarantee.\nFor fixed fee contracts and minimum guarantee contracts where breakage is expected, the total transaction price (fixed fee or minimum guarantee) is typically recognized using an appropriate measure of progress over the contractual term. The Company updates its assessment of the transaction price each reporting period to see if anticipated royalty earnings exceed the minimum guarantee. For contracts where breakage is not expected, royalties are recognized as revenue as sales or usage occurs based upon the licensees usage reports and, when these reports are not available, revenue is based on historical data, industry information and other relevant trends.\nMusic Publishing\nMusic Publishing revenues are earned from the receipt of royalties relating to the licensing of rights in musical compositions and the sale of published sheet music and songbooks. The receipt of royalties principally relates to amounts earned from the public performance of musical compositions, the mechanical reproduction of musical compositions on recorded media, including digital formats and the use of musical compositions in synchronization with visual images. Music publishing royalties, except for synchronization royalties, generally are recognized when the sale or usage occurs. The most common form of consideration for publishing contracts is sales- and usage-based royalties. The collecting societies submit usage reports, typically with payment for royalties due, often on a quarterly or biannual reporting period, in arrears. Royalties are recognized as the sale or usage occurs based upon usage reports and, when these reports are not available, royalties are estimated based on historical data, such as recent royalties reported, company-specific information with respect to changes in repertoire, industry information and other relevant trends. Synchronization revenue is typically recognized as revenue when control of the license is transferred to the customer in accordance with ASC 606.\nAccounting for Royalty Costs and Royalty Advances\nThe Company incurs royalty costs that are payable to our recording artists and songwriters generated from the sale or license of our Recorded Music catalog and Music Publishing copyrights. Royalties owed to artists are calculated using negotiated rates which is applied to revenue earned in accordance with recording artist and songwriter contracts. There are instances where such data is not available to be processed and royalty cost calculations may involve judgments about significant volumes of data to be processed and analyzed.\nWe had $2,219 million and $1,918 million of royalty payables in our balance sheet at September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively.\nIn many instances, the Company commits to pay our recording artists and songwriters royalties in advance of future sales. The Company accounts for these advances under the related guidance in FASB ASC Topic 928, Entertainment-Music (ASC 928). Under ASC 928, the Company capitalizes as assets advances that it believes are recoverable from future royalties to be earned by the recording artist or songwriter. Recoverability is assessed upon initial commitment of the advance based upon the Companys forecast of anticipated revenue from the sale of future and existing albums or musical compositions. In determining whether the advance is recoverable, the Company evaluates the current and past popularity of the recording artist or songwriter, the sales history of the recording artist or songwriter, the initial or expected commercial acceptability of the product, the current and past popularity of the genre of music that the product is designed to appeal to, and other relevant factors. Advances vary in both amount and expected life based on the underlying recording artist or songwriter. To the extent that a portion of an outstanding advance is no longer deemed recoverable, that amount will be expensed in the period the determination is made.\nWe had $1,101 million and $875 million of advances in our balance sheet at September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. We believe such advances are recoverable through future royalties to be earned by the applicable recording artists and songwriters.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein for more information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nAs discussed in Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included herein, the Company is exposed to market risk arising from changes in market rates and prices, including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. As of September 30, 2023, other than as described below, there have been no material changes to the Companys exposure to market risk since September 30, 2022.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWithin our global business operations we have transactional exposures that may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. We may at times choose to use foreign exchange currency derivatives, primarily forward contracts, to manage the risk associated with the volatility of future cash flows denominated in foreign currencies, such as unremitted or future royalties and license fees owed to our U.S. companies for the sale or licensing of U.S.-based music and merchandise abroad that may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We focus on managing the level of exposure to the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on major currencies, which can include the euro, British pound sterling, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona, Australian dollar, Brazilian real, Korean won and Norwegian krone, and in many cases we have natural hedges where we have expenses associated with local operations that offset the revenue in local currency and our euro-denominated debt, which can offset declines in the euro. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had no outstanding hedge contracts.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe had $4.002 billion of principal debt outstanding at September 30, 2023, of which $1.313 billion was variable-rate debt and $2.689 billion was fixed-rate debt. As such, we are exposed to changes in interest rates. At September 30, 2023, 67% of the Companys debt was at a fixed rate. In addition, as of September 30, 2023, we have the option under all of our floating rate debt under the Senior Term Loan Facility to select a one, two, three or six month SOFR rate. To manage interest rate risk on $1,313 million of U.S. dollar-denominated variable-rate debt, the Company has entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert the floating interest rate to a fixed interest rate on a portion of its variable-rate debt. As a result, as of September 30, 2023, 80% of the Companys debt was effectively at a fixed rate.\nBased on the level of interest rates prevailing at September 30, 2023, the fair value of the Companys fixed-rate and variable-rate debt was approximately $3.525 billion. Further, as of September 30, 2023, based on the amount of the Companys fixed-rate debt, a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would decrease the fair value of the fixed-rate debt by approximately $32 million or increase the fair value of the fixed-rate debt by approximately $33 million. This potential fluctuation is based on the simplified assumption that the level of fixed-rate debt remains constant with an immediate across the board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no subsequent changes in rates for the remainder of the period.\nInflation Risk\nInflationary factors such as increases in overhead costs may adversely affect our results of operations. We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations to date. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases for services. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nWARNER MUSIC GROUP CORP.\nANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K\nFOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023\nPage\nNumber\nReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID: 185)\nConsolidated Financial Statements:\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Equity for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFinancial Statement Schedule:\nSchedule II-Valuation and Qualifying Accounts\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nWarner Music Group Corp.:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Warner Music Group Corp. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated November 21, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nSufficiency of audit evidence over Recorded Music digital revenue\nAs discussed in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company generated $3,322 million of digital revenues within the Recorded Music segment for the year ended September 30, 2023. The Companys Recorded Music digital revenue recognition process involves a high volume of royalty transactions dependent on several information technology (IT) applications responsible for the initiation, processing, and recording of transactions in accordance with the Companys accounting policy.\nWe identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence related to digital revenue in the Recorded Music segment as a critical audit matter. Evaluating the sufficiency of audit evidence required especially subjective auditor judgment due to the multiple IT applications, data interfaces, and processing used for the initiation, processing, and recording of transactions, and therefore required involvement of IT professionals.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor judgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over Recorded Music digital revenue. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Recorded Music digital revenue process, including involving IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in that evaluation and testing. This included controls over the capture and flow of royalty transaction information through the Companys IT systems. For a selection of Recorded Music digital revenue agreements, we read the underlying agreements and evaluated the Companys assessment of the contract terms in accordance with revenue recognition requirements. For a sample of revenue transactions, we compared the amounts recognized to (1) underlying sales and usage statements received from customers and cash receipts, where applicable, and (2) underlying documentation, including contracts. For a sample of manual journal entries to Recorded Music digital revenue, which included amounts for contracts that contain non-recoupable fixed fees or minimum guarantees, we agreed amounts to underlying documentation and, where applicable, recalculated the Companys determination of revenue recognized. In addition, we evaluated the overall sufficiency of audit evidence obtained by assessing the results of procedures performed, including appropriateness of the nature and extent of such evidence.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2015.\nNew York, New York\nNovember 21, 2023\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nWarner Music Group Corp.:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Warner Music Group Corp. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated November 21, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nNew York, New York\nNovember 21, 2023\nWarner Music Group Corp.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(In millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands)\nSeptember 30,\n2023 September 30,\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and equivalents $ 641 $ 584\nAccounts receivable, net of allowances of $19 million and $19 million\n1,120 984\nInventories 126 108\nRoyalty advances expected to be recouped within one year 413 372\nPrepaid and other current assets 102 91\nTotal current assets 2,402 2,139\nRoyalty advances expected to be recouped after one year 688 503\nProperty, plant and equipment, net 458 415\nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net 245 226\nGoodwill 1,993 1,920\nIntangible assets subject to amortization, net 2,353 2,239\nIntangible assets not subject to amortization 149 145\nDeferred tax assets, net 32 29\nOther assets 225 212\nTotal assets $ 8,545 $ 7,828\nLiabilities and Equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 300 $ 268\nAccrued royalties 2,219 1,918\nAccrued liabilities 533 457\nAccrued interest 18 17\nOperating lease liabilities, current 41 40\nDeferred revenue 371 423\nOther current liabilities 57 245\nTotal current liabilities 3,539 3,368\nLong-term debt 3,964 3,732\nOperating lease liabilities, noncurrent 255 241\nDeferred tax liabilities, net 216 220\nOther noncurrent liabilities 141 99\nTotal liabilities $ 8,115 $ 7,660\nEquity:\nClass A common stock, $0.001 par value; 1,000,000 shares authorized, 138,345 and 137,199 shares issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively\n$ -

Description of Business\nWarner Music Group Corp. (the Company) was formed on November 21, 2003. The Company is the direct parent of WMG Holdings Corp. (Holdings), which is the direct parent of WMG Acquisition Corp. (Acquisition Corp.). Acquisition Corp. is one of the worlds major music entertainment companies.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn June 5, 2020, the Company completed an initial public offering (IPO) of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.001 per share (Class A Common Stock). The Company listed its shares on the NASDAQ stock market under the ticker symbol WMG. The offering consisted entirely of secondary shares sold by Access Industries, LLC (collectively with its affiliates, Access) and certain related selling stockholders.\nAccess continues to hold all of the Class B common stock of the Company, par value $0.001 per share (Class B Common Stock), representing approximately 98% of the total combined voting power of the Companys outstanding common stock and approximately 73% of the economic interest as of September 30, 2023. As a result, the Company is a controlled company within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of NASDAQ. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Controlling Stockholder.\nRecorded Music Operations\nOur Recorded Music business primarily consists of the discovery and development of recording artists and the related marketing, promotion, distribution, sale and licensing of music created by such recording artists. We play an integral role in virtually all aspects of the recorded music value chain from discovering and developing talent to producing, distributing and selling music to marketing and promoting recording artists and their music.\nMusic Publishing Operations\nWhile Recorded Music is focused on marketing, promoting, distributing and licensing a particular recording of a musical composition, Music Publishing is an intellectual property business focused on generating revenue from uses of the musical composition itself. In return for promoting, placing, marketing and administering the creative output of a songwriter, or engaging in those activities for other rightsholders, our Music Publishing business shares the revenues generated from use of the musical compositions with the songwriter or other rightsholders.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.\nPrior to the start of the 2023 fiscal year, the Company maintained a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the last Friday in each reporting period. The 2022 fiscal year ended on September 30, 2022 and the 2021 fiscal year ended on September 24, 2021. For convenience purposes, the Company dates its financial statements as of September 30 for these periods. The 2022 fiscal year included 53 weeks, and the 2021 fiscal year included 52 weeks. The additional week in fiscal year 2022 fell in the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2021. Accordingly, the results of operations for the 2022 fiscal year reflect 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks for the 2021 fiscal year. Starting with the 2023 fiscal year, the Company transitioned to a reporting calendar in which the reporting periods end on the last day of the calendar quarter. The Companys fiscal year begins on October 1 and ends on September 30 of each year. The Company is not required to file a transition report because this change is not deemed to be a change in fiscal year for purposes of reporting under the Exchange Act pursuant to relevant Securities and Exchange Commission guidance.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe accompanying financial statements present the consolidated accounts of all entities in which the Company has a controlling voting interest and/or variable interest required to be consolidated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 810, Consolidation (ASC 810) requires the Company first evaluate its investments to determine if any investments qualify as a variable interest entity (VIE). A VIE is consolidated if the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, which is the party involved with the VIE that has both (i) the power to control the most significant activities of the VIE and (ii) either the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. If an entity is not deemed to be a VIE, the Company consolidates the entity if the Company has a controlling voting interest.\nThe Company has performed a review of all subsequent events through the date the financial statements were issued and has determined that no additional disclosures are necessary.\nEarnings per Share\nThe consolidated statements of operations present basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS). The Company utilizes the two-class method to report earnings per share. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities are subtracted from net income in determining net income attributable to common stockholders. See also Note 3, Earnings Per Share.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for its business acquisitions under the FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805) guidance for business combinations. The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying identifiable net assets based on their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and often involves the use of estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items.\nCash and Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company includes checks outstanding at year end as a component of accounts payable, instead of a reduction in its cash balance where there is not a right of offset in the related bank accounts. The Company maintains certain cash deposits in excess of FDIC insurance limits.\nAccounts Receivable\nCredit is extended to customers based upon an evaluation of the customers financial condition. Accounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for current expected credit losses.\nRefund Liabilities and Allowance for Credit Losses\nManagements estimate of Recorded Music physical products that will be returned, and the amount of receivables that will ultimately be collected is an area of judgment affecting reported revenues and operating income. In determining the estimate of physical product sales that will be returned, management analyzes vendor sales of product, historical return trends, current economic conditions, changes in customer demand and commercial acceptance of the Companys products. Based on this information, management reserves a percentage of each dollar of physical product sales that provide the customer with the right of return. The provision for such sales returns is reflected as a reduction in the revenues from the related sale.\nSimilarly, the Company monitors customer credit losses related to accounts receivable. Judgments and estimates are involved in evaluating if accounts receivable will ultimately be fully collected. On an ongoing basis, the Company tracks customer exposure based on news reports, ratings agency information, reviews of customer financial data and direct dialogue with customers. Counterparties that are determined to be of a higher risk are evaluated to assess whether the payment terms previously granted to them should be modified. The Company also monitors payment levels from customers, and an allowance for estimated credit losses is maintained based on such payment levels, historical experience, managements views on trends in the overall receivable aging, for\nlarger accounts, analyses of specific risks per customer, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of the economic and geopolitical conditions that may exist through the contractual life of the receivable. The Company will write off receivables only when they are deemed no longer collectible.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nCustomer credit risk represents the potential for financial loss if a customer is unwilling or unable to meet its agreed upon contractual payment obligations. As of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, Spotify AB represented 18% and 17%, respectively, of the Companys accounts receivable balance. No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable in either period. The Company, by policy, routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers. As such, the Company does not believe there is any significant collection risk.\nIn the Music Publishing business, the Company collects a significant portion of its royalties from copyright collecting societies around the world. Collecting societies and associations generally are not-for-profit organizations that represent composers, songwriters and music publishers. These organizations seek to protect the rights of their members by licensing, collecting license fees and distributing royalties for the use of the members works. Accordingly, the Company does not believe there is any significant collection risk from such societies.\nInventories\nInventories consist of merchandise, vinyl, CDs, DVDs and other related music products. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value. Cost is determined using first-in, first-out (FIFO) and average cost methods, which approximate cost under the FIFO method. Returned goods included in inventory are valued at estimated realizable value, but not in excess of cost.\nDerivative and Financial Instruments\nThe Company accounts for these investments as required by the FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815), which requires that all derivative instruments be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. ASC 815 also provides that, for derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value are either (a) offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or (b) recognized in equity until the hedged item is recognized in earnings, depending on whether the derivative is being used to hedge changes in fair value or cash flows. In addition, the ineffective portion of a derivatives change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings.\nThe carrying value of the Companys financial instruments approximates fair value, except for certain differences relating to long-term, fixed-rate debt (see Note 20) and other financial instruments that are not significant. The fair value of financial instruments is generally determined by reference to market values resulting from trading on a national securities exchange or an over-the-counter market. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment acquired in conjunction with business combinations are recorded at fair value. All other additions are recorded at historical cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based upon the estimated useful lives of depreciable assets commencing at the date assets are placed in service as follows: five to seven years for furniture and fixtures, periods of up to five years for computer equipment and software and periods of up to thirteen years for machinery and equipment. Buildings are depreciated over periods of up to forty years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the life of the lease or estimated useful lives of the improvements, whichever period is shorter. Construction in progress assets are not depreciated until placed in service and available for their intended use, at which time they are assigned a useful life consistent with the nature of the asset.\nThe Company accounts for costs incurred to develop or purchase computer software for internal use in accordance with FASB ASC Subtopic 350-40, Internal-Use Software (ASC 350-40). As required by ASC 350-40, the Company capitalizes the costs incurred during the application development stage, which include costs to design the software configuration and interfaces, coding, installation, and testing.\nAccounting for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nIn accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (ASC 350), the Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the acquired entities are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. Goodwill represents synergies and economies of scale expected from the combination of services and is determined based on the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets, including the amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets. Pursuant to this guidance, the Company does not amortize the goodwill balance and instead, performs an annual impairment test to assess the fair value of goodwill over its carrying value. Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives.\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment on July 1 and at any time upon occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances. ASC 350 gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, then performing the quantitative impairment test is unnecessary. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then the quantitative impairment test shall be used to identify the impairment and measure the amount of an impairment loss to be recognized (if applicable).\nThe Company performs an annual impairment test of its indefinite-lived intangible assets as of July 1 of each fiscal year, unless events occur which trigger the need for an earlier impairment test. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. In the qualitative assessment, the Company must evaluate the totality of qualitative factors, including any recent fair value measurements, that impact whether an indefinite-lived intangible asset other than goodwill has a carrying amount that more likely than not exceeds its fair value. The Company must proceed to conduct a quantitative analysis if the Company (i) determines that such an impairment is more likely than not to exist or (ii) forgoes the qualitative assessment entirely.\nThe impairment tests may require management to make assumptions about future conditions impacting the value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets, including projected growth rates, cost of capital, effective tax rates, tax amortization periods, royalty rates, market share and others.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company periodically reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangibles, property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or that the lives assigned may no longer be appropriate. To the extent the estimated future cash inflows attributable to the asset, less estimated future cash outflows, are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value. Assets to be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan to dispose of the assets, whether through sale or abandonment, are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. If it is determined that events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization, an assets remaining useful life would be changed, and the remaining carrying amount of the asset would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life.\nForeign Currency\nThe financial position and operating results of substantially all foreign operations are consolidated using the local currency as the functional currency. Local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange on the balance sheet date, and local currency revenues and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the period. Resulting translation gains or losses are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nForeign currency transaction gains and losses arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a foreign currency other than the functional currency. The Company recorded foreign currency transaction gains of $4 million, losses of $11 million and losses of $0 million within operating income on the consolidated statement of operations during the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company recorded foreign currency transaction losses of $37 million, gains of $185 million and losses of $8 million within other (expense) income, net on the consolidated statement of operations during the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nRevenues\nRecorded Music\nAs required by FASB ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606), the Company recognizes revenue when, or as, control of the promised services or goods is transferred to our customers and in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company is contractually due in exchange for those services or goods. The Companys revenue recognition process involves several applications that are responsible for the initiation and processing of transactions in order to recognize revenue in accordance with the Companys policy and ASC 606.\nRevenues from the sale or license of Recorded Music products through digital distribution channels are typically recognized when sale or usage occurs based on usage reports received from the customer. These licenses typically contain a single performance obligation, which is ongoing access to all intellectual property in an evolving content library, predicated on: (1) the business practice and contractual ability to remove specific content without a requirement to replace the content and without impact to minimum royalty guarantees and (2) the contracts not containing a specific listing of content subject to the license. For certain licenses where the consideration is fixed and the intellectual property being licensed is static, revenue is recognized at the point in time when control of the licensed content is transferred to the customer.\nCertain contracts contain minimum guarantees, which are recoupable against royalties. Upon contract inception, the Company will assess whether a shortfall or breakage is expected (i.e., where the minimum guarantee will not be recouped through royalties) in order to determine timing of revenue recognition for the minimum guarantee. For fixed fee contracts and minimum guarantee contracts where breakage is expected, the total transaction price (fixed fee or minimum guarantee) is recognized using an appropriate measure of progress over the contractual term. The Company updates its assessment of the transaction price each reporting period to see if anticipated royalty earnings exceed the minimum guarantee. For contracts where breakage is not expected, royalties are recognized as revenue as sales or usage occurs based upon the licensees usage reports and, when these reports are not available, revenue is based on historical data, industry information and other relevant trends.\nMusic Publishing\nMusic Publishing revenues are earned from the receipt of royalties relating to the licensing of rights in musical compositions and the sale of published sheet music and songbooks. The receipt of royalties principally relates to amounts earned from the public performance of musical compositions, the mechanical reproduction of musical compositions on recorded media, including digital formats and the use of musical compositions in synchronization with visual images. Music publishing royalties, except for synchronization royalties, generally are recognized when the sale or usage occurs. The most common form of consideration for publishing contracts is sales- and usage-based royalties. The collecting societies submit usage reports, typically with payment for royalties due, often on a quarterly or biannual reporting period, in arrears. Royalties are recognized as the sale or usage occurs based upon usage reports and, when these reports are not available, royalties are estimated based on historical data, such as recent royalties reported, company-specific information with respect to changes in repertoire, industry information and other relevant trends. Synchronization revenue is typically recognized as revenue when control of the license is transferred to the customer in accordance with ASC 606. See also Note 4, Revenue Recognition.\nRoyalty Costs and Royalty Advances\nThe Company incurs royalty costs that are payable to our recording artists and songwriters generated from the sale or license of our Recorded Music catalog and Music Publishing copyrights. Royalties are calculated using negotiated rates in accordance with recording artist and songwriter contracts and are based on revenue earned. There are instances where such data is not available to be processed and royalty cost calculations may involve judgments about significant volumes of data to be processed.\nIn many instances, the Company commits to pay our recording artists and songwriters royalties in advance of future sales. The Company accounts for these advances under the related guidance in FASB ASC Topic 928, Entertainment-Music (ASC 928). Under ASC 928, the Company capitalizes as assets certain advances that it believes are recoverable from future royalties to be earned by the recording artist or songwriter. Recoverability is assessed upon initial commitment of the advance based upon the Companys forecast of anticipated revenue from the sale of future and existing albums or musical compositions. In determining whether the advance is recoverable, the Company evaluates the current and past popularity of the recording artist or songwriter, the sales history of the recording artist or songwriter, the initial or expected commercial acceptability of the product, the current and past popularity of the genre of music that the product is designed to appeal to, and other relevant factors. Advances vary in both amount and expected life based on the underlying recording artist or songwriter. To the extent that a portion of an outstanding advance is no longer deemed recoverable, that amount will be expensed in the period the determination is made.\nAdvertising\nAs required by the FASB ASC Subtopic 720-35, Advertising Costs (ASC 720-35), advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense amounted to approximately $136 million, $155 million and $149 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively. Deferred advertising costs, which principally relate to advertisements that have been paid for but not been exhibited or services that have not been received, were not material for all periods presented.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based payments in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation (ASC 718). Stock-based compensation consists primarily of restricted stock units (RSUs) granted to eligible employees and executives under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. The Company measures compensation expense for RSUs based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. The grant date fair value is based on the closing market price of the Companys Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. Stock-based compensation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally four years.\nThe Company also grants restricted stock to the Companys directors. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of the restricted stock, based on the closing stock price on grant date, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally one year.\nThe Company also grants market-based performance share units (PSUs) to our Chief Executive Officer whereby the PSU award payout is determined based on the Companys total shareholder return compared to a designated peer group. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of the PSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation model analysis, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is approximately three years.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are provided using the asset and liability method presented by FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). Under this method, income taxes (i.e., deferred tax assets, deferred tax liabilities, taxes currently payable/refunds receivable and tax expense) are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current fiscal year and include the results of any differences between U.S. GAAP and tax reporting. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of net operating loss, capital loss and general business credit carryforwards and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statements and income tax purposes, as determined under enacted tax laws and rates. Valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized. The financial effect of changes in tax laws or rates is accounted for in the period of enactment. Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) imposes U.S. taxes on the excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of certain foreign subsidiaries. The Company made an election to recognize GILTI tax in the specific period in which it occurs.\nFrom time to time, the Company engages in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty. Judgment may be required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions. The Company prepares and files tax returns based on its interpretation of tax laws and regulations. In the normal course of business, the Companys tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities. In determining the Companys tax provision for financial reporting purposes, the Company establishes a reserve for uncertain tax positions, unless such positions are determined to be more likely than not of being sustained upon examination based on their technical merits. There is judgment involved in determining whether positions taken on the Companys tax returns are more likely than not of being sustained.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (ASU 2020-04). The amendment provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by the discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or by another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform, if certain criteria are met. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope, which clarified that certain optional expedients and exceptions in ASC Topic 848, Reference Rate Reform (ASC 848) apply to derivative instruments that are affected by the discounting transition due to reference rate reform. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date, which extended the period in which ASC 848 may be applied until December 31, 2024. These ASUs were effective upon issuance and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications and hedging relationships\nentered into or evaluated through December 31, 2024. The Revolving Credit Facility and Senior Term Loan Facility were amended during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 as further described in Note 10.\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-01, Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements (ASU 2023-01). The amendment clarifies the accounting for leasehold improvements for leases between entities under common control. Specifically, the ASU 2023-01 requires that leasehold improvements associated with common control leases be both: (1) amortized by the lessee over the useful life of the leasehold improvement to the common control group, regardless of the lease term, and (2) accounted for as an adjustment to equity when leasehold improvements are transferred between entities under common control when the lessee no longer controls the leasehold improvements. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. The Company is in the process of evaluating the effect that the adoption of these standards will have on its consolidated financial statements.\n3. Earnings per Share\nThe Company utilizes the two-class method to report earnings per share. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to each class of stock by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares for each class of stock. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to each class of stock by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares, plus dilutive potential common shares, which is calculated using the treasury-stock method. Under the treasury-stock method, potential common shares are excluded from the computation of EPS in periods in which they have an anti-dilutive effect. The potentially dilutive common shares did not have a dilutive effect on the Companys EPS calculation for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021.\nThe Company allocates dividends declared to Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock based on timing and amounts actually declared for each class of stock and the undistributed earnings are allocated to Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock pro rata on a basic weighted average shares outstanding basis since the two classes of stock participate equally on a per share basis upon liquidation.\nThe following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net income per common share under the two-class method (in millions, except share amounts, which are reflected in thousands, and per share data):\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nClass A Class B Class A Class B Class A Class B\nBasic and Diluted EPS:\nNumerator\nNet income attributable to Warner Music Group Corp.\n$ 119 $ 311 $ 149 $ 402 $ 68 $ 236\nLess: Net income attributable to participating securities (6) - (7) - (4) -\nNet income attributable to common stockholders\n$ 113 $ 311 $ 142 $ 402 $ 64 $ 236\nDenominator\nWeighted average shares outstanding 138,070 377,650 133,662 381,046 110,561 402,912\nBasic and Diluted EPS $ 0.82 $ 0.82 $ 1.06 $ 1.06 $ 0.58 $ 0.58\n4. Revenue Recognition\nFor our operating segments, Recorded Music and Music Publishing, the Company accounts for a contract when it has legally enforceable rights and obligations and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company identifies the performance obligations and determines the transaction price associated with the contract, which is then allocated to each performance obligation, using managements best estimate of standalone selling price for arrangements with multiple performance obligations. Revenue is recognized when, or as, control of the promised services or goods is transferred to the Companys customers, and in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company is contractually due in exchange for those services or goods. An estimate of variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in the Companys judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. Certain of the Companys arrangements include licenses of intellectual property with consideration in the form of sales- and usage-based royalties. Royalty revenue is recognized when the subsequent sale or usage\noccurs using the best estimates available of the amounts that will be received by the Company. Within revenues, there may be settlements related to past infringements of our intellectual property.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe Companys revenue consists of the following categories, which aggregate into the segments - Recorded Music and Music Publishing:\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in millions)\nRevenue by Type\nDigital $ 3,322 $ 3,305 $ 3,105\nPhysical 507 563 549\nTotal Digital and Physical 3,829 3,868 3,654\nArtist services and expanded-rights 744 767 599\nLicensing 382 331 291\nTotal Recorded Music 4,955 4,966 4,544\nPerformance 173 159 122\nDigital 669 563 436\nMechanical 63 50 49\nSynchronization 167 172 144\nOther 16 14 10\nTotal Music Publishing 1,088 958 761\nIntersegment eliminations (6) (5) (4)\nTotal Revenues $ 6,037 $ 5,919 $ 5,301\nRevenue by Geographical Location\nU.S. Recorded Music $ 2,184 $ 2,231 $ 1,985\nU.S. Music Publishing 582 513 378\nTotal U.S. 2,766 2,744 2,363\nInternational Recorded Music 2,771 2,735 2,559\nInternational Music Publishing 506 445 383\nTotal International 3,277 3,180 2,942\nIntersegment eliminations (6) (5) (4)\nTotal Revenues $ 6,037 $ 5,919 $ 5,301\nRecorded Music\nRecorded Music mainly involves selling, marketing, distribution and licensing of recorded music produced by the Companys recording artists. Recorded Music revenues are derived from four main sources, which include digital, physical, artist services and expanded-rights, and licensing.\nDigital revenues are generated from the expanded universe of digital partners, including digital streaming services and download services. These licenses typically contain a single performance obligation, which is ongoing access to all intellectual property in an evolving content library, predicated on: (1) the business practice and contractual ability to remove specific content without a requirement to replace the content and without impact to minimum royalty guarantees and (2) the contracts not containing a specific listing of content subject to the license. Digital licensing contracts are generally long-term with consideration in the form of sales- and usage-based royalties that are typically received monthly. Certain contracts contain minimum guarantees, which are recoupable against royalties. Upon contract inception, the Company will assess whether a shortfall or breakage is expected (i.e., where the minimum guarantee will not be recouped through royalties) in order to determine timing of revenue recognition for the minimum guarantee.\nFor fixed fee contracts and minimum guarantee contracts where breakage is expected, the total transaction price (fixed fee or minimum guarantee) is recognized proportionately over the contract term using an appropriate measure of progress which is based on the Companys digital partners subscribers or streaming activity as these are measures of access to an evolving catalog, or on a straight-line basis. The Company updates its assessment of the transaction price each reporting period to see if anticipated royalty\nearnings exceed the minimum guarantee. For contracts where breakage is not expected, royalties are recognized as revenue as sales or usage occurs based upon the licensees usage reports and, when these reports are not available, revenue is based on historical data, industry information and other relevant trends.\nAdditionally, for certain licenses where the consideration is fixed and the intellectual property being licensed is static, revenue is recognized at the point in time when control of the licensed content is transferred to the customer.\nPhysical revenues are generated from the sale of physical products such as vinyl, CDs and DVDs. Revenues from the sale of physical Recorded Music products are recognized upon transfer of control to the customer, which typically occurs once the product has been shipped and the ability to direct use and obtain substantially all of the benefit from the asset have been transferred. In accordance with industry practice and as is customary in many territories, certain products, such as vinyl, CDs and DVDs, are sold to customers with the right to return unsold items. Revenues from such sales are generally recognized upon shipment based on gross sales less a provision for future estimated returns.\nArtist services and expanded-rights revenues are generated from artist services businesses and participation in expanded-rights associated with artists, including advertising, merchandising including direct-to-consumer sales, touring, concert promotion, ticketing, sponsorship, fan clubs, artist websites, social publishing, and artist and brand management. Artist services and expanded-rights contracts are generally short term. Revenue is recognized as or when services are provided (e.g., at time of an artists event) assuming collectability is probable. In some cases, the Company is reliant on the artist to report revenue generating activities. For certain artist services and expanded-rights contracts, collectability is not considered probable until notification is received from the artists management. Revenues from the sale of products sold through our e-commerce websites are recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which is upon receipt of finished goods by the customer.\nLicensing revenues represent royalties or fees for the right to use sound recordings in combination with visual images such as in films or television programs, television commercials and video games. In certain territories, the Company may also receive royalties when sound recordings are performed publicly through broadcast of music on television, radio and cable and in public spaces such as shops, workplaces, restaurants, bars and clubs. Licensing contracts are generally short term. For fixed-fee contracts, revenue is recognized at the point in time when control of the licensed content is transferred to the customer. Royalty based contracts are recognized as the underlying sales or usage occurs.\nMusic Publishing\nMusic Publishing acts as a copyright owner and/or administrator of the musical compositions and generates revenues related to the exploitation of musical compositions (as opposed to recorded music). Music publishers generally receive royalties from the use of the musical compositions in public performances, digital and physical recordings and in combination with visual images. Music publishing revenues are derived from five main sources: mechanical, performance, synchronization, digital and other.\nDigital revenues are generated with respect to the musical compositions being embodied in recordings licensed to digital streaming services and digital download services and for digital performance. Performance revenues are received when the musical composition is performed publicly through broadcast of music on television, radio and cable and in retail locations (e.g., bars and restaurants), live performance at a concert or other venue (e.g., arena concerts and nightclubs) and performance of musical compositions in staged theatrical productions. Mechanical revenues are generated with respect to the musical compositions embodied in recordings sold in any physical format or configuration such as vinyl, CDs and DVDs. Synchronization revenues represent the right to use the composition in combination with visual images such as in films or television programs, television commercials and video games as well as from other uses such as in toys or novelty items and merchandise. Other revenues represent earnings for use in printed sheet music and other uses. Digital and synchronization revenue recognition is similar for both Recorded Music and Music Publishing, therefore refer to the discussion within Recorded Music.\nIncluded in these revenue streams, excluding synchronization and other, are licenses with performing rights organizations or collecting societies (e.g., ASCAP, BMI, SESAC and GEMA), which are long-term contracts containing a single performance obligation, which is ongoing access to all intellectual property in an evolving content library. The most common form of consideration for these contracts is sales- and usage-based royalties. The collecting societies submit usage reports, typically with payment for royalties due, often on a quarterly or biannual reporting period, in arrears. Royalties are recognized as the sale or usage occurs based upon usage reports and, when these reports are not available, royalties are estimated based on historical data, such as recent royalties reported, company-specific information with respect to changes in repertoire, industry information and other relevant trends. Also included in these revenue streams are smaller, short-term contracts for specified content, which generally involve a fixed fee. For fixed-fee contracts, revenue is recognized at the point in time when control of the license is transferred to the customer.\nThe Company excludes from the measurement of transaction price all taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both (i) imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and (ii) collected from customers.\nSales Returns and Uncollectible Accounts\nIn accordance with practice in the recorded music industry and as customary in many territories, certain physical revenue products (such as vinyl, CDs and DVDs) are sold to customers with the right to return unsold items. Revenues from such sales are recognized when the products are shipped based on gross sales less a provision for future estimated returns.\nIn determining the estimate of physical product sales that will be returned, management analyzes vendor sales of product, historical return trends, current economic conditions, changes in customer demand and commercial acceptance of the Companys products. Based on this information, management reserves a percentage of each dollar of physical product sales that provide the customer with the right of return and records an asset for the value of the returned goods and liability for the amounts expected to be refunded.\nSimilarly, management evaluates accounts receivables to determine if they will ultimately be collected. In performing this evaluation, significant judgments and estimates are involved, including an analysis of specific risks on a customer-by-customer basis for larger accounts and customers and a receivables aging analysis that determines the percent that has historically been uncollected by aged category, in addition to other factors to estimate an allowance for credit losses. The time between the Companys issuance of an invoice and payment due date is not significant; customer payments that are not collected in advance of the transfer of promised services or goods are generally due no later than 30 days from invoice date. Based on this information, management provides a reserve for estimated credit losses.\nBased on managements analysis of sales returns, refund liabilities of $19 million and $19 million were established at September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively.\nBased on managements analysis of estimated credit losses, reserves of $19 million and $19 million were established at September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively.\nPrincipal versus Agent Revenue Recognition\nThe Company reports revenue on a gross or net basis based on managements assessment of whether the Company acts as a principal or agent in the transaction. The determination of whether the Company acts as a principal or an agent in a transaction is based on an evaluation of whether the Company controls the good or service before transfer to the customer. When the Company concludes that it controls the good or service before transfer to the customer, the Company is considered a principal in the transaction and records revenue on a gross basis. When the Company concludes that it does not control the good or service before transfer to the customer but arranges for another entity to provide the good or service, the Company acts as an agent and records revenue on a net basis in the amount it earns for its agency service.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company distributes music content on behalf of third-party record labels. Based on the above guidance, the Company records the distribution of content of third-party record labels on a gross basis, subject to the terms of the contract, as the Company controls the content before transfer to the customer. Conversely, recorded music distributed by other record companies where the Company has a right to participate in the profits are recorded on a net basis.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue principally relates to fixed fees and minimum guarantees received in advance of the Companys performance or usage by the licensee. Reductions in deferred revenue are a result of the Companys performance under the contract or usage by the licensee.\nDeferred revenue increased by $724 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 and $666 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 related to cash received from customers for fixed fees and minimum guarantees in advance of performance, including amounts recognized in the period. Revenue recognized during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 which was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of each respective period was $393 million and $274 million. There were no other significant changes to deferred revenue during the reporting period.\nPerformance Obligations\nFor the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized revenue of $91 million, $59 million and $64 million, respectively, from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods.\nWholly and partially unsatisfied performance obligations represent future revenues not yet recorded under long-term intellectual property licensing contracts containing fixed fees, advances and minimum guarantees. Revenues expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied at September 30, 2023 are as follows:\nFY24\nFY25\nFY26\nThereafter Total\n(in millions)\nRemaining performance obligations $ 637 $ 128 $ 7 $ 6 $ 778\nTotal $ 637 $ 128 $ 7 $ 6 $ 778\n5. Acquisitions\nTenThousand Projects\nOn August 25, 2023, the Company purchased 51% of the issued and outstanding equity securities of TenThousand Projects Holdings LLC (TenThousand Projects), an independent U.S. record label, pursuant to the terms of the unit purchase agreement of the same date among Warner Music Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, TenThousand Projects LLC, and Ten Thousand Projects Holdings LLC (the Unit Purchase Agreement). The consideration transferred on the acquisition date was approximately $98 million which was comprised of the base purchase price of $102 million and the preliminary working capital adjustments, primarily comprised of cash acquired, net of a deferred purchase price of $12 million which is payable on or prior to one year from the acquisition date.\nThe acquisition of TenThousand Projects was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, using the acquisition method of accounting, as the Company had acquired a controlling financial interest in TenThousand Projects. The results of operations of TenThousand Projects have been included in the Companys results of operations from the date of the acquisition.\nThe preliminary estimate of the fair value of the net assets acquired was approximately $21 million and primarily consisted of royalty advances. The preliminary estimate of the fair value of identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization was approximately $153 million and consists of a recorded music catalog, artist and songwriting contracts, and trademarks which have a preliminary fair value of $99 million, $49 million, and $5 million, respectively. The weighted-average useful lives of these intangible assets identified are consistent with the average remaining useful lives of such intangible assets previously acquired by the Company as disclosed in Note 9. The preliminary estimate of the fair value of the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree was approximately $106 million and was determined using the implied enterprise value of the business based on the purchase price. The excess of the purchase price over the preliminary estimate of the fair value of net assets acquired, including the amount assigned to identifiable intangibles assets, was approximately $43 million and has been recorded as goodwill. The resulting goodwill has been included in our Recorded Music reportable segment and the Companys 51% share will be deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe acquisition accounting is subject to revision based on final determinations of fair value and allocations of purchase price to the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, in addition to the determination of the final consideration, including the determination of the final working capital adjustment pursuant to the mechanism set forth in the Unit Purchase Agreement.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred costs related to this acquisition of approximately $3 million, which were expensed as incurred and recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. The unaudited pro forma revenue and operating income as if the acquisition occurred on October 1, 2021 was not material to the Companys reported results for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022.\n300 Entertainment\nOn December 16, 2021, the Company purchased all outstanding shares of Theory Entertainment LLC d/b/a 300 Entertainment (300 Entertainment), an independent U.S. record label, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement of the same date among Warner Music Inc. and MM Investment LLC, both wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company, the Buyer Representative, Trifecta Merger Subsidiary LLC, Theory Entertainment LLC d/b/a 300 Entertainment and the Seller Representative (the Merger Agreement). Cash consideration paid was $394 million, which reflects the base purchase price of $400 million, adjusted for, among other items, working capital.\nThe acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, using the acquisition method of accounting. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired, including the amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets, has been recorded as goodwill. The resulting goodwill has been included in our Recorded Music reportable segment. The recognized goodwill will be deductible for income tax purposes. Any impairment charges made in future periods associated with goodwill, if any, will not be tax-deductible.\nThe table below presents (i) the acquisition consideration as it relates to the acquisition of 300 Entertainment and (ii) the allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the closing date of December 16, 2021 (in millions):\nPurchase Price Allocation\nCash and equivalents $ 2\nAccounts receivable 5\nRoyalty advances 13\nProperty, plant and equipment, net 1\nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net 3\nGoodwill 138\nIntangible assets subject to amortization, net (a) 259\nOther assets 1\nAccounts payable (5)\nAccrued royalties (19)\nAccrued liabilities (1)\nOperating lease liabilities, noncurrent (3)\nTotal purchase price allocated $ 394\n______________________________________\n(a)Identifiable intangible assets are composed of the following (in millions):\nTotal\nRecorded music catalog $ 154\nArtist and songwriter contracts 90\nTrademarks 12\nMusic publishing copyrights 3\nTotal intangible assets acquired $ 259\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company updated and finalized the purchase price allocation recorded at September 30, 2022, which resulted in a decrease to intangible assets of approximately $1 million and a net decrease to other acquired assets and liabilities of approximately $2 million, with a corresponding net increase to goodwill of approximately $3 million.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the Company incurred costs related to this acquisition of approximately $3 million, which were expensed as incurred and recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Prior to the acquisition, the Company had a distribution arrangement with 300 Entertainment. The unaudited pro forma revenue and operating income as if the acquisition occurred on October 1, 2020 was not material to the Companys reported results for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021.\n6. Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income, which is reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of equity, consists of net income and other gains and losses affecting equity that, under U.S. GAAP, are excluded from net income. For the Company, the components of other comprehensive income primarily consist of foreign currency translation gains and losses, minimum pension liabilities, and deferred gains and losses on financial instruments designated as hedges under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The following summary sets forth the changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of related tax benefit of $5 million:\nForeign Currency Translation Gains (Losses) (a)\nMinimum Pension Liability Adjustment Deferred Gains (Losses) On Derivative Financial Instruments\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, net\n(in millions)\nBalances at September 30, 2020 $ (181) $ (12) $ (29) $ (222)\nOther comprehensive income 7 1 12 20\nBalances at September 30, 2021 $ (174) $ (11) $ (17) $ (202)\nOther comprehensive loss (184) 9 30 (145)\nBalances at September 30, 2022 $ (358) $ (2) $ 13 $ (347)\nOther comprehensive income 36 1 (12) 25\nBalances at September 30, 2023 $ (322) $ (1) $ 1 $ (322)\n______________________________________\n(a)Includes historical foreign currency translation related to certain intra-entity transactions.\n7.

Leases\nThe Companys lease portfolio consists of operating real estate leases for its corporate offices and, to a lesser extent, storage and other equipment. The Company adopted FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases (ASC 842), on October 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method. Under ASC 842, a contract is or contains a lease when (1) an explicitly or implicitly identified asset has been deployed in the contract and (2) the customer obtains substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of that underlying asset and directs how and for what purpose the asset is used during the term of the contract. The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception of the contract. For all leases (finance and operating), other than those that qualify for the short-term recognition exemption, the Company will recognize on the balance sheet a lease liability for its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease and a corresponding right-of-use (ROU) asset representing its right to use the underlying asset over the period of use based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term as of the lease commencement date. ROU assets are adjusted for initial direct costs, lease payments made and incentives. As the rates implicit in our leases are not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. This rate is based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments. The lease term used to calculate the lease liability will include options to extend or terminate the lease when the option to extend or terminate is at the Companys discretion and it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. Fixed payments are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For leases with a term of one year or less, the lease payments are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nASC 842 requires that only limited types of variable payments be included in the determination of lease payments, which affects lease classification and measurement. Variable lease costs, if any, are recognized as incurred and such costs are excluded from lease balances recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. The initial measurement of the lease liability and ROU asset are determined based on fixed lease payments. Lease payments that depend on an index or a rate (such as the Consumer Price Index or a market interest rate) are variable and are recognized in the period in which the payments are incurred.\nThe Companys operating ROU assets are included in operating lease right-of-use assets and the Companys current and non-current operating lease liabilities are included in operating lease liabilities, current and operating lease liabilities, noncurrent, respectively, in the Companys balance sheet.\nOperating lease liabilities are amortized using the effective interest method. That is, in each period, the liability will be increased to reflect the interest that is accrued on the related liability by using the appropriate discount rate and decreased by the lease payments made during the period. The subsequent measurement of the ROU asset is linked to the amount recognized as the lease liability. Accordingly, the ROU asset is measured as the lease liability adjusted by (1) accrued or prepaid rents (i.e., the aggregate difference between the cash payment and straight-line lease cost), (2) remaining unamortized initial direct costs and lease incentives, and (3) impairments of the ROU asset. Operating lease costs are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses.\nFor lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components, the Company has elected the practical expedient provided by ASC 842 that permits the accounting for these components as a single lease component (rather than separating the lease from the non-lease components and accounting for the components individually).\nThe Company enters into operating leases for buildings, office equipment, production equipment, warehouses, and other types of equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 20 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 10 years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within 1 year.\nAmong the Companys operating leases are its leases for the Ford Factory Building, located at 777 S. Santa Fe Avenue in Los Angeles, California, and for 27 Wrights Lane, Kensington, London, United Kingdom. The landlord for both leases is an affiliate of Access. As of September 30, 2023, the aggregate lease liability related to these leases was $110 million. See also Note 15, Related Party Transactions.\nThere are no restrictions or covenants, such as those relating to dividends or incurring additional financial obligations, relating to our lease portfolio, and residual value guarantees are not significant.\nThe components of lease expense were as follows:\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n2023 2022\n(in millions)\nLease Cost\nOperating lease cost $ 52 $ 53\nShort-term lease cost - 2\nVariable lease cost 13 11\nTotal lease cost $ 65 $ 66\nThe Company incurred and recorded other occupancy expenses of $25 million and $23 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n2023 2022\n(in millions)\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities $ 56 $ 58\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease obligations 77 7\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows:\nSeptember 30,\n2023 September 30,\n(in millions)\nOperating Leases\nOperating lease right-of-use assets $ 245 $ 226\nOperating lease liabilities, current $ 41 $ 40\nOperating lease liabilities, noncurrent 255 241\nTotal operating lease liabilities $ 296 $ 281\nWeighted Average Remaining Lease Term\nOperating leases 7 years 7 years\nWeighted Average Discount Rate\nOperating leases 5.55 % 4.75 %\nMaturities of lease liabilities were as follows:\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, Operating\nLeases\n(in millions)\n2024 $ 56\n2025 55\n2026 49\n2027 49\n2028 49\nThereafter 104\nTotal lease payments 362\nLess: Imputed interest (66)\nTotal $ 296\nAs of September 30, 2023, we have an additional operating lease for facilities that has not yet commenced with a lease obligation of $1 million and a lease term of 7 years.\n9.

The Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, which represents the remaining unamortized discount and deferred financing costs of the Tranche H term loan.\nHistorical Transactions\n3.750% Senior Secured Notes Offering\nOn November 24, 2021, Acquisition Corp. issued and sold $540 million of its 3.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2029 (the 3.750% Senior Secured Notes). Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of 3.750% per annum and will be payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1, commencing on June 1, 2022.\nThe 3.750% Senior Secured Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each of Acquisition Corp.s existing direct or indirect wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries and by any such subsidiaries that guarantee obligations of Acquisition Corp. under its existing credit facilities, subject to customary exceptions. The indenture governing the 3.750% Senior Secured Notes contains covenants limiting, among other things, Acquisition Corp.s ability and the ability of most of its subsidiaries to create liens and consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets.\nInterest Rates\nThe loans under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at Acquisition Corp.s election at a rate equal to (i) the secured overnight financing rate as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the applicable interest period (Revolving Term SOFR), and other rates for alternate currencies, such as EURIBOR and SONIA, as provided in the Revolving Credit Agreement, subject to a zero floor, plus 1.75% per annum in the case of Initial Revolving Loans (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement), or 1.875% per annum in the case of 2020 Revolving Loans (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement), or (ii) the base rate, which is the highest of (x) the corporate base rate established by the administrative agent from time to time, (y) 0.50% in excess of the overnight federal funds rate and (z) the one-month Revolving Term SOFR plus 1.0% per annum, plus, in each case, 0.75% per annum in the case of Initial Revolving Loans, or 0.875% per annum in the case of 2020 Revolving Loans; provided that, in respect of 2020 Revolving Loans, the applicable margin with respect to such loans is subject to adjustment as set forth in the pricing grid in the Revolving Credit Agreement. Based on the Senior Secured Indebtedness to EBITDA Ratio of 2.84x at September 30, 2023, the applicable margin for SOFR loans and RFR loans would be 1.375% instead of 1.875% and the applicable margin for ABR loans would be 0.375% instead of 0.875% in the case of 2020 Revolving Loans. If there is a payment default at any time, then the interest rate applicable to overdue principal will be the rate otherwise applicable to such loan plus 2.0% per annum. Default interest will also be payable on other overdue amounts at a rate of 2.0% per annum above the amount that would apply to an alternative base rate loan.\nThe Tranche G loans under the Senior Term Loan Facility bear interest at Acquisition Corp.s election at a rate equal to (i) the forward-looking term rate based on the secured overnight financing rate as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the applicable interest period (Term SOFR) plus an adjustment based on the applicable interest period subject to a zero floor, plus 2.125% per annum or (ii) the base rate, which is the highest of (x) the corporate base rate established by the administrative agent as its prime rate in effect at its principal office in New York City from time to time, (y) 0.50% in excess of the overnight federal funds rate and (z) one-month Term SOFR, plus 1.00% per annum, subject to a 1.00% floor, plus, in each case, 1.125% per annum. If there is a payment default at any time, then the interest rate applicable to overdue principal and interest will be the rate otherwise applicable to such loan plus 2.0% per annum. Default interest will also be payable on other overdue amounts at a rate of 2.0% per annum above the amount that would apply to an alternative base rate loan.\nThe Tranche H loans under the Senior Term Loan Facility, which were repaid in full on June 30, 2023, bore interest at Acquisition Corp.s election at a rate equal to (i) the forward-looking term rate based on the secured overnight financing rate as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the applicable interest period (Term SOFR) subject to a 0.50% floor, plus 3.00% per annum or (ii) the base rate, which is the highest of (x) the corporate base rate established by the administrative agent as its prime rate in effect at its principal office in New York City from time to time, (y) 0.50% in excess of the overnight federal funds rate and (z) one-month Term SOFR, plus 1.00% per annum, subject to a 1.50% floor, plus, in each case, 2.00% per annum. If there was a payment default at any time, then the interest rate applicable to overdue principal and interest would have been the rate otherwise applicable to such loan plus 2.0% per annum. Default interest was also payable on other overdue amounts at a rate of 2.0% per annum above the amount that would apply to an alternative base rate loan.\nThe Term Loan Mortgage bears interest at a rate of 30-day SOFR plus the applicable margin of 1.40%, subject to a zero floor.\nThe Company has entered into, and in the future may enter into, interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk.

Distribution of these earnings may result in foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state taxes. However, variables existing if and when remittance occurs make it impracticable to estimate the amount of the ultimate tax liability, if any, on these accumulated foreign earnings.\nThe Company classifies interest and penalties related to uncertain tax position as a component of income tax expense.

This amount is reflected as a share-based compensation liability as of September 30, 2023.\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, the Company issued market-based performance share units to our newly appointed Chief Executive Officer whereby the award payout is determined based on the Companys total shareholder return compared to a designated peer group. Non-cash stock-based compensation associated with this award was approximately $4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, in connection with the Restructuring Plan, the Company recognized $2 million of non-cash stock-based compensation related to the accelerated vesting of certain RSUs. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion.\n15. Related Party Transactions\nLease Arrangements with Related Parties\nOn March 29, 2019, an affiliate of Access acquired the Ford Factory Building, located on 777 S. Santa Fe Avenue in Los Angeles, California from an unaffiliated third party. The building is the Companys Los Angeles, California headquarters and the Company is the sole tenant of the building acquired by Access. The existing lease agreement was assumed by Access upon purchase of the building and was not modified as a result of the purchase. Rental payments by the Company under the existing lease for the 2023 fiscal year were approximately $14 million and are subject to annual fixed increases throughout the remainder of the lease term. The remaining lease term is approximately 7 years, after which the Company may exercise a single option to extend the term of the lease for 10 years thereafter.\nOn July 29, 2014, AI Wrights Holdings Limited, an affiliate of Access, entered into a lease and related agreements with Warner Chappell Music Limited and WMG Acquisition (UK) Limited, subsidiaries of the Company, for the lease of 27 Wrights Lane, Kensington, London, United Kingdom. The Company had been the tenant of the building which Access acquired. Subsequent to the change in ownership, the parties entered into the lease and related agreements pursuant to which, on January 1, 2015, the rent was increased to \u00a33,460,250 per year and the term was extended for an additional five years from December 24, 2020 to December 24, 2025, with a market rate rent review which began on December 25, 2020. On June 26, 2023, the parties entered into an extension on substantially the same terms as the current lease for an additional five years with the lease now expiring on December 24, 2030.\nLicense Agreements with Deezer\nAccess owns an equity interest in Deezer S.A., which was formerly known as Odyssey Music Group (Odyssey), a French company that controls and operates a music streaming service, formerly through Odysseys subsidiary, Blogmusik SAS (Blogmusik), under the name Deezer (Deezer), and is represented on Deezer S.A.s Board of Directors. Subsidiaries of the Company have been a party to license arrangements with Deezer since 2008, which provide for the use of the Companys sound recordings on Deezers ad-supported and subscription streaming services worldwide (excluding China, North Korea, and Japan (included for subscription services only)) in exchange for fees paid by Deezer. The Company has also authorized Deezer to include the Companys sound recordings in Deezers streaming services where such services are offered as a bundle with third-party services or products (e.g., telco services or hardware products), for which Deezer is also required to make payments to the Company. Deezer paid to the Company an aggregate amount of approximately $40 million, $36 million and $42 million in connection with the foregoing arrangements during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In addition, in connection with these arrangements, (i) the Company was issued warrants to purchase shares of Deezer S.A. and (ii) the Company purchased a small number of shares of Deezer S.A. The Company also has various publishing agreements with Deezer. Warner Chappell has licenses with Deezer for use of repertoire on the service in Europe, which the Company refers to as a PEDL license (referencing the Companys Pan European Digital Licensing initiative), and for territories in Latin America. For the PEDL and Latin American licenses for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, Deezer paid the Company an additional approximately $2 million, $2 million and $2 million, respectively. Deezer also licenses other publishing rights controlled by Warner Chappell through statutory licenses or through various collecting societies.\nOn April 13, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase 900,000 ordinary shares for \u20ac9 million of I2PO, a French Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme and special purpose acquisition company listed on the Paris Euronext Exchange. I2PO merged with Deezer S.A., which was consummated on July 5, 2022. In connection with the merger, preferred shares in Deezer S.A. previously held by the Company were converted into ordinary shares of the combined publicly traded entity. Following the consummation of the merger, I2PO was renamed Deezer. The Companys equity interests in Deezer S.A. are recorded at fair value in accordance with ASC 321, Investments-Equity Securities based on quoted prices in active markets. As of September 30, 2023, the fair value of these equity interests was approximately $14 million.\nInvestment in Tencent Music Entertainment Group\nOn October 1, 2018, WMG China LLC (WMG China), an affiliate of the Company, entered into a share subscription agreement with Tencent Music Entertainment Group pursuant to which WMG China purchased 37,162,288 ordinary shares of Tencent Music Entertainment Group for $100 million. WMG China was 80% owned by AI New Holdings 5 LLC, an affiliate of Access, and 20% owned by the Company.\nOn November 4, 2021, WMG China distributed to the Company, the Companys pro-rata share of the Tencent Music Entertainment Group equity held by WMG China. WMG China was dissolved on May 9, 2022.\n16. Commitments and Contingencies\nTalent Advances\nThe Company routinely enters into long-term commitments with recording artists, songwriters, publishers and third-party labels for the future delivery of music. Such commitments generally become due only upon delivery and Company acceptance of albums from the recording artists or future musical compositions from songwriters and publishers. Additionally, such commitments are typically cancellable at the Companys discretion, generally without penalty. Based on contractual obligations and the Companys expected release schedule, off-balance sheet aggregate firm commitments to such talent approximated $383 million and $469 million as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively.\nOther\nOther off-balance sheet firm commitments, which primarily include minimum funding commitments to investees, amounted to approximately $46 million and $48 million at September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively.\nLitigation\nThe Company is involved in various litigation and regulatory proceedings arising in the normal course of business. Where it is determined, in consultation with counsel based on litigation and settlement risks, that a loss is probable and estimable in a given matter, the Company establishes an accrual. In the currently pending proceedings, the amount of accrual is not material. An estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amounts already accrued cannot be made at this time due to various factors typical in contested proceedings, including (1) the results of ongoing discovery; (2) uncertain damage theories and demands; (3) a less than complete factual record; (4) uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or regulators; and (5) the unpredictable nature of the opposing party and its demands. However, the Company cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any litigation or the potential for future litigation. As such, the Company continuously monitors these proceedings as they develop and adjusts any accrual or disclosure as needed. Regardless of the outcome, litigation could have an adverse impact on the Company, including the Companys brand value, because of defense costs, diversion of management resources and other factors and it could have a material effect on the Companys results of operations for a given reporting period.\n17. Derivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments, primarily foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps, for the purposes of managing foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.\nThe Company enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily to hedge the risk that unremitted or future royalties and license fees owed to its U.S. companies for the sale or licensing of U.S.-based music and merchandise abroad may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company focuses on managing the level of exposure to the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on its major currencies, which include the Euro, British pound sterling, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona, Australian dollar, Brazilian real, Korean won and Norwegian krone. The Company also may at times choose to hedge foreign currency risk associated with financing transactions such as third-party debt and other balance sheet items. The Companys foreign currency forward exchange contracts have not been designated as hedges under the criteria prescribed in ASC 815. The Company records these contracts at fair value on its balance sheet and the related gains and losses are immediately recognized in the consolidated statement of operations where there is an offsetting entry related to the underlying exposure.\nThe Company has entered into, and in the future may enter into, interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk. These instruments may offset a portion of changes in income or expense, or changes in fair value of the Companys long-term debt. The interest rate swap instruments were designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under the criteria prescribed in ASC 815 until the discontinuation of LIBOR. The Company recorded these contracts at fair value on its balance sheet and gains or losses on these contracts are deferred in equity (as a component of comprehensive income). Subsequent to the discontinuation of LIBOR, the Company dedesignated the remaining interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge given the SOFR benchmark rates for the interest rate swap and the Senior Term Loan Facility no longer perfectly match and the expiration of the swap in the first quarter of 2024. Upon dedesignation, the unrealized gains recognized in equity were fixed and reclassified into the consolidated statement of operations over the remaining term and changes in fair value of the swap from the dedesignation date being recognized within the consolidated statement of operations.\nThe fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts is determined by using observable market transactions of spot and forward rates (i.e., Level 2 inputs) which is discussed further in Note 20. Additionally, netting provisions are provided for in existing International Swap and Derivative Association Inc. agreements in situations where the Company executes multiple contracts with the same counterparty. As a result, net assets or liabilities resulting from foreign exchange derivatives subject to these netting agreements are classified within other current assets or other current liabilities in the Companys consolidated balance sheets.\nThe fair value of interest rate swaps is based on dealer quotes of market rates (i.e., Level 2 inputs) which is discussed further in Note 20. Interest income or expense related to interest rate swaps is recognized in interest income (expense), net in the same period as the related expense is recognized. The ineffective portions of interest rate swaps are recognized in other income (expense) in the period measured.\nThe Company monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions that are party to any of its financial transactions.\nAs of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the Company had no outstanding hedge contracts and no deferred gains or losses in comprehensive income related to foreign exchange hedging.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding $500 million in a pay-fixed receive-variable interest rate swap with $1 million unrealized deferred gains in comprehensive income related to the interest rate swaps. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had outstanding $820 million in pay-fixed receive-variable interest rate swaps with $13 million of unrealized deferred gains in comprehensive income related to the interest rate swaps.\nThe Company recorded realized pre-tax losses of $6 million related to its foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the consolidated statement of operations as other expense for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. The Company recorded realized pre-tax gains of $10 million related to its foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the consolidated statement of operations as other income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.\nThe unrealized pre-tax losses of the Companys derivative interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges recorded in other comprehensive income during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 were $16 million. The unrealized pre-tax gains of the Companys derivative interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges recorded in other comprehensive income during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 were $40 million.\nThe following is a summary of amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets pertaining to the Companys derivative instruments at September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022:\nSeptember 30, 2023 September 30, 2022\n(in millions)\nOther Current Assets:\nInterest Rate Swap $ 2 $ 2\nOther Noncurrent Assets:\nInterest Rate Swap - 16\n18. Segment Information\nAs discussed more fully in Note 1, based on the nature of its products and services, the Company classifies its business interests into two fundamental operations: Recorded Music and Music Publishing, which also represent the reportable segments of the Company. Information as to each of these operations is set forth below. The Company evaluates performance based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is operating income (loss) before non-cash depreciation of tangible assets and non-cash amortization of intangible assets (OIBDA). The Company has supplemented its analysis of OIBDA results by segment with an analysis of operating income (loss) by segment.\nThe accounting policies of the Companys business segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies included elsewhere herein. The Company accounts for intersegment sales at fair value as if the sales were to third parties. While intercompany transactions are treated like third-party transactions to determine segment performance, the revenues (and corresponding expenses recognized by the segment that is counterparty to the transaction) are eliminated in consolidation, and therefore, do not themselves impact consolidated results.\nRecorded\nMusic Music\nPublishing Corporate\nexpenses and\neliminations Total\n(in millions)\nRevenues $ 4,955 $ 1,088 $ (6) $ 6,037\nOperating income (loss) 875 200 (285) 790\nAmortization of intangible assets 155 90 - 245\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment 50 3 34 87\nOIBDA 1,080 293 (251) 1,122\nTotal assets 4,677 2,781 1,087 8,545\nCapital expenditures 39 1 87 127\nRevenues $ 4,966 $ 958 $ (5) $ 5,919\nOperating income (loss) 796 139 (221) 714\nAmortization of intangible assets 176 87 - 263\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment 51 5 20 76\nOIBDA 1,023 231 (201) 1,053\nTotal assets 3,515 2,954 1,359 7,828\nCapital expenditures 52 1 82 135\nRevenues $ 4,544 $ 761 $ (4) $ 5,301\nOperating income (loss) 733 89 (213) 609\nAmortization of intangible assets 150 79 - 229\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment 53 6 18 77\nOIBDA 936 174 (195) 915\nCapital expenditures 33 1 59 93\nRevenues relating to operations in different geographical areas are set forth below for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021.

In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the Company had three customers, Spotify, Apple and YouTube, that individually represented 10% or more of total revenues, whereby Spotify represented 17%, YouTube represented 12% and Apple represented 11% of total revenues. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, the Company had three customers, Spotify, Apple and YouTube that individually represented 10% or more of total revenues, whereby Spotify represented 18%, Apple represented 13% and YouTube represented 11% of total revenues. These customers revenues are included in both the Companys Recorded Music and Music Publishing segments and the Company expects that the Companys license agreements with these customers will be renewed in the normal course of business.\n19. Additional Financial Information\nCash Interest and Taxes\nThe Company made interest payments of approximately $157 million, $122 million and $137 million during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively. The Company paid approximately $219 million, $141 million and $124 million of income and withholding taxes, net of refunds, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively.\nGain on Divestiture\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, the Company sold its interest in certain sound recording rights and recorded a pre-tax gain of $41 million which was recorded as a net gain on divestiture in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.\nDividends\nThe Companys ability to pay dividends may be restricted by covenants in the credit agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility which are currently suspended but which will be reinstated if Acquisition Corp.s Total Indebtedness to EBITDA Ratio increases above 3.50:1.00 and the term loans do not achieve an investment grade rating.\nThe Company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends to holders of its Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. The declaration of each dividend will continue to be at the discretion of the Companys board of directors and will depend on the Companys financial condition, earnings, liquidity and capital requirements, level of indebtedness, contractual restrictions with respect to payment of dividends, restrictions imposed by Delaware law, general business conditions and any other factors that the Companys board of directors deems relevant in making such a determination. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Company will pay any dividends to holders of the Companys common stock, or as to the amount of any such dividends.\nThe Company paid cash dividends to stockholders and participating security holders of $340 million, $318 million and $265 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nOn November 9, 2023, the Companys board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.17 per share on the Companys Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, as well as related payments under certain stock-based compensation plans, payable on December 1, 2023 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 21, 2023.\nNoncash Investment Activity\nNoncash investing activities was approximately $125 million related to the acquisition of music publishing rights and music catalogs, net during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.\n20. Fair Value Measurements\nASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (ASC 820) defines fair value as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity.\nIn addition to defining fair value, ASC 820 expands the disclosure requirements around fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Each fair value measurement is reported in one of the three levels which is determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:\nLevel 1-inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.\nLevel 2-inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3-inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect managements estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques that include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques.\nIn accordance with the fair value hierarchy, described above, the following tables show the fair value of the Companys financial instruments that are required to be measured at fair value as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022.\nFair Value Measurements as of September 30, 2023\n(Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total\n(in millions)\nOther Current Assets:\nInterest Rate Swap (c)\n$ - $ 2 $ - $ 2\nOther Noncurrent Assets:\nEquity Investment with Readily Determinable Fair Value (b)\n15 - - 15\nOther Noncurrent Liabilities:\nContractual Obligations (a) - - (1) (1)\nFair Value Measurements as of September 30, 2022\n(Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total\n(in millions)\nOther Current Assets:\nInterest Rate Swap (c)\n$ - $ 2 $ - $ 2\nOther Noncurrent Assets:\nInterest Rate Swap (c)\n- 16 - 16\nEquity Investment with Readily Determinable Fair Value (b)\n36 - - 36\nOther Noncurrent Liabilities:\nContractual Obligations (a) - - (1) (1)\n______________________________________\n(a)This represents contingent consideration related to acquisitions. This is based on a probability weighted performance approach and it is adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis and any adjustments are typically included as a component of operating income in the consolidated statements of operations. This amount was primarily calculated using unobservable inputs such as future earnings performance of the acquiree and the expected timing of payments.\n(b)These represent equity investments with a readily determinable fair value. The Company has measured its investments to fair value in accordance with ASC 321, Investments-Equity Securities, based on quoted prices in active markets.\n(c)The fair value of the interest rate swaps is based on dealer quotes of market forward rates and reflects the amount that the Company would receive or pay as of September 30, 2023 for contracts involving the same attributes and maturity dates.\nThe following table reconciles the beginning and ending balances of net liabilities classified as Level 3:\nTotal\n(in millions)\nBalance at September 30, 2022 $ (1)\nAdditions -\nReductions -\nPayments -\nBalance at September 30, 2023 $ (1)\nThe majority of the Companys non-financial instruments, which include goodwill, intangible assets, inventories and property, plant and equipment, are not required to be re-measured to fair value on a recurring basis. These assets are evaluated for impairment if certain triggering events occur. If such evaluation indicates that impairment exists, the asset is written down to its fair value. In addition, an impairment analysis is performed at least annually for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nEquity Investments Without Readily Determinable Fair Value\nThe Company evaluates its equity investments without readily determinable fair values for impairment if factors indicate that a significant decrease in value has occurred. The Company has elected to use the measurement alternative to fair value that will allow these investments to be recorded at cost, less impairment, and adjusted for subsequent observable price changes. The Company recorded approximately $1 million of impairment charges on these investments during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. In\naddition, observable price changes events that were completed during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 resulted in a unrealized gain of $2 million.\nFair Value of Debt\nBased on the level of interest rates prevailing at September 30, 2023, the fair value of the Companys debt was $3.525 billion. Based on the level of interest rates prevailing at September 30, 2022, the fair value of the Companys debt was $3.181 billion. The fair value of the Companys debt instruments is determined using quoted market prices from less active markets or by using quoted market prices for instruments with identical terms and maturities; both approaches are considered a Level 2 measurement.\nWARNER MUSIC GROUP CORP.\nSchedule II - Valuation and Qualifying Accounts\nDescription Balance at Beginning of Period Additions Charged to Cost and Expenses Deductions Balance at End of Period\n(in millions)\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2023\nAllowance for credit losses\n$ 19 $ 5 $ (5) $ 19\nReserves for sales returns 19 39 (39) 19\nAllowance for deferred tax asset 29 1 (5) 25\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2022\nAllowance for credit losses\n$ 20 $ 5 $ (6) $ 19\nReserves for sales returns 23 52 (56) 19\nAllowance for deferred tax asset 38 2 (11) 29\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2021\nAllowance for credit losses\n$ 23 $ 1 $ (4) $ 20\nReserves for sales returns 24 53 (54) 23\nAllowance for deferred tax asset 45 2 (9) 38 ITEM 9.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nCertification\nThe certifications of the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer (or persons performing similar functions) required by Rules 13a-14(a) and 15d-14(a) of the Exchange Act (the Certifications) are filed as exhibits to this report. This section of the report contains the information concerning the evaluation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) (Disclosure Controls) and changes to internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) (Internal Controls) referred to in the Certifications and this information should be read in conjunction with the Certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented.\nIntroduction\nThe SECs rules define disclosure controls and procedures as controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by public companies in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by public companies in the reports that they file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to a companys management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nThe SECs rules define internal control over financial reporting as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a public companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Companys board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, including those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nThe Companys management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our Disclosure Controls or Internal Controls will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the limitations in any and all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. Further, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of these inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected even when effective Disclosure Controls and Internal Controls are in place.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on managements evaluation (with the participation of the Companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Companys Disclosure Controls are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act will be recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, including that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting or other factors that occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.\nManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Management designed our internal control systems in order to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nOur internal control systems include the controls themselves, monitoring and internal auditing practices and actions taken to correct deficiencies as identified and are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing for division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified financial personnel and a program of internal audits.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 Framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the results of this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2023.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\", of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
