    "content": "ITEM 1.\nBUSINESS\nOur Business\nJanel Corporation (Janel, the Company or the Registrant) is a holding company with subsidiaries in three business segments: Logistics, Life Sciences and Manufacturing. The Company strives to create shareholder value primarily through three strategic priorities: supporting its businesses efforts to make investments and to build long-term profits\u037e allocating Janel capital at high risk-adjusted rates of return\u037e and attracting and retaining exceptional talent.\nManagement at the Janel holding company focuses on significant capital allocation decisions, corporate governance and supporting Janels subsidiaries where appropriate. Janel expects to grow through its subsidiaries organic growth and by completing acquisitions. We plan to either acquire businesses within our existing segments or expand our portfolio into new strategic segments. Our acquisition strategy focuses on reasonably priced companies with strong and capable management teams, attractive existing business economics and stable and predictable earnings power.\nJanel was incorporated on August 31, 2000 and is domiciled in the state of Nevada. Its corporate headquarters are located in New York, New York.\nAs of September 30, 2022, Janel and its consolidated subsidiaries employed 326 full-time employees in the United States. None of these employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Janel and its subsidiaries have experienced no work stoppages and consider relations with their employees to be good. Successful execution of our strategy is dependent on attracting, developing and retaining key employees and members of our management team. The skills, experience and industry knowledge of our employees significantly benefit our operations and performance. We continuously evaluate, modify and enhance our internal processes and technologies to increase employee engagement, productivity, efficiency opportunities, skills and resources needed for success.\nOur Business Segments\nWe have three reportable segments: Logistics, Life Sciences and Manufacturing. The following provides greater detail regarding each of these segments.\nLogistics\nThe Companys Logistics segment is comprised of several wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Logistics segment is a non-asset based, full-service provider of cargo transportation logistics management services, including freight forwarding via air, ocean and land-based carriers; customs brokerage services; warehousing and distribution services; trucking and other value-added logistics services. In addition to these revenue streams, the Company earns accessorial revenue in connection with its core services. Accessorial revenue includes, but is not limited to, fuel service charges, wait time fees, hazardous cargo fees, labor charges, handling, cartage, bonding and additional labor charges.\nOn September 21, 2021, the Company completed a business combination whereby it acquired all the membership interests of Expedited Logistics and Freight Services, LLC (ELFS) and related subsidiaries, which we include in our Logistics segment.\nOn December 31, 2020, the Company completed a business combination whereby it acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of W.R. Zanes & Co. of LA., Inc., (W.R. Zanes), which we include in our Logistics segment.\nLife Sciences\nThe Companys Life Sciences segment is comprised of several wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Companys Life Sciences segment manufactures and distributes high-quality monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, diagnostic reagents and other immunoreagents for biomedical research and provides antibody manufacturing for academic and industry research scientists. Our Life Sciences segment also produces products for other life science companies on an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) basis.\nOn August 15, 2022, the Company completed a business combination whereby it acquired all the membership interests of ECM Biosciences LLC, which we include in our Life Sciences segment.\nOn December 4, 2020, the Company completed a business combination whereby it acquired all the membership interests of ImmunoChemistry Technologies, LLC (ICT), which we include in our Life Sciences segment.\nManufacturing\nThe Companys Manufacturing segment is comprised of Indco, Inc. (Indco). Indco is a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company that manufactures and distributes mixing equipment and apparatuses for specific applications within various industries. Indcos customer base is comprised of small- to mid-sized businesses as well as other larger customers for which Indco fulfills repetitive production orders.\nRecent Investment\nOn August 19, 2022, the Company acquired 1,108,000 shares of the common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Rubicon Technology, Inc. (\"Rubicon\"), at a price per share of $20.00, in a cash tender offer made pursuant to the Stock Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated July 1, 2022, between the Company and Rubicon (the \"Rubicon Purchase Agreement\"). Pursuant to the terms of the Rubicon Purchase Agreement, the acquired shares represent 44.99% of Rubicon's issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of August 3, 2022, as reported in Rubicon's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2022, filed with the SEC on August 12, 2022.\nRubicon is a vertically integrated, advanced materials provider specializing in monocrystalline sapphire for applications in optical and industrial systems. Rubicon uses proprietary crystal growth technology to produce high-quality sapphire products to meet customers exacting specifications.\nThe purpose of our investment in Rubicon is for Janel to acquire a significant ownership interest in Rubicon, together with representation on Rubicon's Board, in an attempt to (i) restructure the Rubicon business to achieve profitability and (ii) assist Rubicon in utilizing its net operating loss (\"NOL\") carry-forward assets. Although we are optimistic about our investment in Rubicon, our investment involves risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control, including those discussed herein under Item 1A, Risk Factors.\nLogistics\nThe Companys Logistics segment helps clients move and manage freight efficiently to reduce inventories and to increase supply chain speed and reliability. Key services include customs entry filing; arrangement of freight forwarding by air, ocean and ground; warehousing; cargo insurance procurement; logistics planning; product repackaging; online shipment tracking and hazardous material warehousing and distribution.\nOur Logistics segment earns flat fees for certain services, such as customs entry filing. For brokered services, Logistics earns the difference between the rate charged by a service provider and the rate Logistics charges the customer for the providers service. Its freight consolidation activities, in addition to on-going volume-based relationships with providers, allow Logistics to command preferred service rates that can be passed on profitably to the customer.\nAs a non-asset-based logistics provider, we own only a minimal amount of equipment. We generally expect to neither own nor operate any material transportation assets and, consequently, arrange for transportation of our customers shipments via trucking companies, commercial airlines, air cargo carriers, railroads, ocean carriers and other non-asset based third-party providers. By not owning the transportation equipment used to transport the freight, which results in relatively minimal fixed operating costs, we are able to leverage our network of locations to offer competitive pricing and flexible solutions to our customers. Moreover, our balanced product offering provides us with revenue streams from multiple sources and enables us to retain customers even as they shift across various modes of transportation. We believe our low capital intensity model allows us to provide low-cost solutions to our customers, operate our business with strong cash flow characteristics and retain significant flexibility in responding to changing industries and economic conditions.\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, Logistics handled approximately 167,000 individual import and export shipments originating or terminating in countries around the world. Approximately 42% of the revenues from these activities related to ocean freight, 32% to trucking, 16% to air freight, 5% to custom brokerage trucking and the remainder of 5% to other.\nBased upon revenues, our customers are diverse, with the largest individual customer accounting for about 3.5% of revenues and the top ten customers accounting for 22.1% of revenues during fiscal 2022.\nAs of September 30, 2022, our Logistics segment operated out of twenty-five full-service locations in the United States and maintained a network of independent agent relationships in many trading countries, giving it the ability to provide a global service to its clients.\nEach office is responsible for its growth and profitability. Logistics management helps the offices as needed with efforts such as human resources, maintaining a common information technology platform and centralized accounting services. Our growth strategy includes servicing existing customers well and acquiring more of their business, hiring new people who can grow our company and adding new companies or services through acquisitions.\nThe logistics industry is highly fragmented, with low barriers to entry and intense competition. Our Logistics segment competes against providers ranging in size from mom-and-pop businesses to multi-national firms with hundreds of offices worldwide. Many of our Logistics customers utilize more than one logistics provider.\nThe freight forwarding industry requires dealings in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. As a result, our Logistics segment is exposed to the inherent risks of international currency markets and governmental interference. Some countries in which the Logistics segment maintains agent relationships have currency control regulations that influence our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure. Logistics tries to manage these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among those agents.\nHistorically, the quarterly operating results of the Logistics segment have been subject to seasonal trends. The fiscal third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest, and the fiscal second quarter has traditionally been the weakest. This pattern has been the result of, or influenced by, numerous factors including climate, national holidays, consumer demand, economic conditions and other similar and subtle forces.\nA significant portion of Logistics segment revenues are derived from customers in industries with shipping patterns tied to consumer demand and/or just-in-time production schedules. Many Logistics customers may ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter. Therefore, the timing of revenues is, to a large degree, affected by factors beyond the segment's control, such as shifting consumer demand for retail goods and manufacturing production delays. We cannot accurately forecast many of these factors, nor can we estimate the relative impact of any given factor. Therefore, historical patterns experienced may not continue in the future.\nGovernment Regulation\nInterstate and international transportation of freight is highly regulated. Failure to comply with applicable state and federal regulations, or to maintain required permits or licenses, can result in substantial fines or revocation of operating permits or authorities imposed on both transportation intermediaries and their shipper customers. We cannot give assurance as to the degree or cost of future regulations on our business. Some of the regulations affecting our current and prospective operations are described below.\nLogistics is a customs broker licensed and permitted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). All U.S. customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by CBP. Logistics is a registered Ocean Transportation Intermediary (OTI) and is licensed as a non-vessel operating common carrier (NVOCC) by the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC). The FMC has established certain qualifications for shipping agents, including certain surety bonding requirements. We also operate as a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) certified Indirect Air Carrier (IAC), providing air freight services, subject to commercial standards set forth by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and federal regulations issued by the Transportation Security Administration.\nAir freight forwarding operations are subject to regulation, as an indirect air cargo carrier, under the Federal Aviation Act, as enforced by the Federal Aviation Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Transportation Security Administration of the Department of Homeland Security. While air freight forwarders are exempted from most of the Federal Aviation Acts requirements by the Economic Aviation Regulations, the industry is subject to ongoing regulatory and legislative developments that can impact the economics of the industry by requiring changes to operating practices or influencing the demand for, and the costs of, providing services to customers.\nSurface freight forwarding operations are subject to various state and federal statutes and are regulated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation and, to a very limited extent, the Surface Transportation Board. These federal agencies have broad investigatory and regulatory powers, including the power to issue a certificate of authority or license to engage in the business; to approve specified mergers, consolidations and acquisitions; and to regulate the delivery of some types of domestic shipments and operations within particular geographic areas.\nThe Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration also has the authority to regulate interstate motor carrier operations, including the regulation of certain rates, charges and accounting systems; to require periodic financial reporting; and to regulate insurance, driver qualifications, operation of motor vehicles, parts and accessories for motor vehicle equipment, hours of service of drivers, inspection, repair, maintenance standards and other safety related matters. The federal laws governing interstate motor carriers have both direct and indirect application to the Company. The breadth and scope of the federal regulations may affect our operations and the motor carriers that are used in the provisioning of the transportation services. In certain locations, state or local permits or registrations may also be required to provide or obtain intrastate motor carrier services.\nRisk Management and Insurance\nAs a property freight broker, we are not legally liable for loss or damage to our customers cargo. In our customer contracts, we may agree to assume cargo liability up to a stated maximum.\nWe typically do not assume cargo liability above minimum industry standards in our international freight forwarding, ocean transportation or air freight businesses on international or domestic air shipments. With regards to international freight forwarding, ocean transportation and international domestic air freight shipments, we offer our customers the option to purchase shippers insurance coverage to insure goods in transit. When we agree to store goods for our customers for longer terms, we provide limited warehousemans coverage to our customers and typically contract for warehousing services from companies that provide us the same degree of coverage.\nWe maintain a broad cargo liability insurance policy to help protect us against catastrophic losses that may not be recovered from the responsible contracted carrier. We also carry various liability insurance policies, including automobile and general liability, with an umbrella policy.\nLife Sciences\nThe Companys wholly-owned Life Sciences segment manufactures and distributes high-quality monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, diagnostic reagents and other immunoreagents for biomedical research and provides antibody manufacturing for academic and industry research scientists.\nOur Life Sciences segment also produces products for life science companies on an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) basis. Through a combined portfolio of nearly 3,000 products and a range of custom services, the Life Sciences segment provides the scientific community with high-quality tools to support critical research efforts.\nOur Life Sciences segment is based in Davis, California on an owned 40-acre facility and two other leased locations in the U.S. Our growth strategy is to place high-quality products in the hands of more researchers to accelerate scientific discovery.\nOur growth strategies include:\nProduct innovation: By working with key researchers and scientific organizations, we seek to develop new products to enhance the range of tools available and thereby expand the capabilities of life science researchers.\nOperational improvement: We continue to enhance our operational designs and processes to be more efficient, which supports higher profitability and enables us to devote more resources to investments in growth and innovation.\nAttract and retain exceptional talent: High-quality scientists enable our top-quality products and services to be offered, which are key to our reputation in the marketplace.\nAcquisitions and investments: We intend to grow by acquiring new businesses with high-quality reputations that will benefit from our combined innovation and operational strength.\nCustomers and distribution methods: We sell our biotechnology products directly to customers, principally direct through our website or distributors. Some of our customers utilize our scientific expertise and production capabilities and purchase our products and re-label them. Our reputation for quality products is critical to our ability to attract new customers for both our products and services.\nBroad product offering: A number of companies supply protein-related research and diagnostic reagents. Customers choose their products based upon product quality, reputation and price. We believe a number of our products have long-standing reputations and that our portfolio overall is well-regarded, especially amongst the academic, diagnostic and pharmaceutical research community.\nManufacturing: Our antibodies are produced using a variety of technologies including traditional animal immunization and hybridoma technology as well as recombinant antibody techniques. We are not dependent on key or sole source suppliers for most of our products, as we typically have several outside sources for all critical raw materials necessary for the manufacture of our products.\nThe majority of our life science products are shipped within two days of receipt of customers orders. Consequently, we typically do not maintain a significant backlog of orders for our Life Sciences segment products.\nOur Life Sciences segment is subject to regulation. One of our subsidiaries, Antibodies, Inc., maintains International Organization of Standardization certification for medical devices to support our manufacturing operation. We also comply with regulations related to the United States Department of Agriculture, National Institutes of Health, Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare and the United States Food and Drug Administration. Many of our customers are regulated and must verify our compliance with their standards throughout the supply chain, which requires us to maintain careful records. The failure to comply with these regulations may impair our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nManufacturing\nThe Companys Manufacturing segment is composed of Indco, which is a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company that manufactures and distributes mixing equipment and apparatuses for specific applications within various industries. Indcos headquarters and manufacturing operations are located in a single owned facility in New Albany, Indiana.\nIndco provides solutions for the mixing needs of customers operating in diverse industries, including chemicals, inks, paints, construction, plastics, adhesives, cosmetics, food and pharmaceuticals. Solutions include standard product configurations, both manufactured and distributed, available for order from Indcos website and its print catalog, which is mailed quarterly. In addition, Indco manufactures custom-designed mixing solutions that Indco helps specify, design, machine, assemble and distribute. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, Indco made approximately 4,400 individual shipments to customers. In fiscal 2022, approximately 83% of Indcos revenue came from manufacturing activity. The remainder of its revenue came from non-manufactured product distribution activity. Indcos revenue is generally level throughout the year with little seasonality.\nIndco relies on a variety of providers of raw materials, mechanical components and other services in order to manufacture its products. These providers include national and multi-national suppliers for common industrial components such as motors, gear drives, motor controls and many other standard hardware products. Additionally, regional and local suppliers provide Indco-specific parts such as castings and fabricated metal components. Raw materials-primarily steel bars, plates and shafts-are sourced from domestic steel mills through local distributors. Alternative or substantially similar options are available from suppliers other than those Indco currently employs. While custom cast or fabricated parts are at greater risk of supply interruption, alternative equivalent suppliers are typically available.\nOur growth strategy within the industrial mixer business is to enhance our reputation as a high-quality manufacturer of often customized products to meet specialized mixing needs. Indcos products are frequently utilized in mission-critical applications, making our high-quality and strong service offering highly valuable to our customers. Our growth strategy includes keeping our direct relationship with the customer relevant through our web presence, introducing new relevant products and expanding our reach into new and existing markets with sales efforts and partners.\nThe industrial mixer manufacturing industry is highly fragmented with low barriers to entry. Indco competes with companies of all sizes based on a combination of pricing, lead-times, service, quality and ability to reach customers through internet presence and catalog circulation.\nGovernment regulation directly governing Indcos industrial mixer product line is minimal. Changing energy efficiency standards, however, as mandated by the Department of Energy, can, over time, affect electric motor manufacturers whose products are used by Indco. Historically, these changes have resulted in only minor changes to our product line.\nIndco is subject to U.S. federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment. Although current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws, the Company cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on Indco. Indco does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during the remainder of the current or succeeding fiscal years.\nAdditional information with respect to Janels businesses\nOur principal executive offices and corporate headquarters are located at 80 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10011, and our telephone number is (212) 373-5895.\nJanel maintains a website (http://www.janelcorp.com) where certain corporate governance documents and links to its subsidiaries websites can be found. Janels periodic reports filed with the SEC can be accessed at the SECs website (http://www.sec.gov) and indirectly through Janels website (http://www.janelcorp.com). The information contained or connected to our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with an evaluation of the Companys business and any forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and elsewhere. See the section entitled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements set forth above. Any of the following risks or others discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or the Companys other SEC filings could materially adversely affect the Companys business, operating results and financial condition. An investment in Janels common stock is subject to risks inherent to the Companys business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect Janel are described below. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair the Companys business operations.\nRisk Factors Related To Janel's Growth Strategy\nJanel's strategy of expanding its business through acquisitions of other businesses presents special risks.\nJanel expects to grow its businesses in part by completing acquisitions, either through acquisitions of businesses within its existing segments or the expansion of its portfolio into new segments. In either case:\nJanel's financial condition may not be sufficient to support the funding needs of an expansion program;\nJanel may not be able to successfully identify suitable investment opportunities;\nacquisitions that Janel undertakes may not be successfully consummated or enhance profitability; or\nexpansion opportunities may not be available to Janel upon reasonable terms.\nThere may be a limited number of operating companies available for acquisition that Janel deems to be desirable targets. At times, there may be a limited number of operating companies availible for acquisition an fewer attractive targets may be available, and it may require more time, more effort and more resources to identify a suitable target and to consummate an acquisition. Janel may compete with entities whose financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities are significantly greater than Janel's. Therefore, Janel may be at a competitive disadvantage in negotiating and executing possible acquisitions. Even if Janel is successful in a competitive bidding process for an acquisition, this competition may affect the terms of completed transactions, and, as a result, Janel may pay more or receive less favorable terms than it expected for potential acquisitions.\nIn addition, even if Janel is able to successfully compete with these entities, it expects future acquisitions to encounter risks similar to those that past acquisitions have encountered, such as:\ndifficulty in assimilating/integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses;\npotential disruption of Janels or the targets ongoing business;\ninability to realize the projected operational and financial benefits from the acquisition or to maximize financial and strategic benefits through the incorporation of acquired personnel and clients;\ndifficulty maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\nimpairment of relationships with employees and clients resulting from integration of the newly acquired company;\nstrain on managerial and operational resources as management tries to oversee larger operations and newly acquired businesses;\nsignificantly increased need for working capital to operate the acquired companies;\nexposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies.\nFurthermore, managements attention may be diverted by acquisition, investment, transition or integration activities. Janel may be required to dedicate additional management and other resources to newly acquired businesses.\nAdditionally, should Janel acquire a new line of business in which it has no operating history, the success of such new business cannot be assured. If an acquired entity is not efficiently or completely integrated, there may be a material adverse effect on Janels business and operations.\nJanel may be required to record a significant change to earnings if its goodwill and other amortizable intangible assets, or other investments, become impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and/or stock price.\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually and to review our goodwill, amortizable intangible assets and other assets acquired through merger and acquisition activity for impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of such assets may no longer be recoverable. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill, amortizable intangible assets and other assets acquired via acquisitions include significant adverse changes in the business climate, actual or projected operating results affecting Janel or any of its particular segments, and a decline in the financial condition of our business. If our goodwill, amortizable intangible assets or other investments become impaired in the future, we may be required to record additional charges to earnings. Such charges would have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nJanel might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition it undertakes, or it may spend resources exploring acquisitions that are not consummated.\nDue to its acquisition strategy, Janel faces a number of risks that may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. Janel might not achieve its expected return on investment or may lose capital. Furthermore, Janel may be materially adversely impacted by liabilities that it assumes from an acquired business, including from that businesss known and unknown obligations, intellectual property or other assets, terminated employees, current or former clients or other third parties.\nIn addition, Janel may fail to identify or adequately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring, investing in or partnering with a company, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions or liabilities resulting from an acquired businesss previous activities, internal controls and security environment. If any of these circumstances occurs, they could result in unexpected legal or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on Janels business and operations.\nLitigation, indemnification claims and other unforeseen claims and liabilities may arise from the acquisition or operation of acquired businesses.\nJanel may face litigation or other claims as a result of certain terms and conditions of our acquisition agreements, stock purchase agreements, tender offers and other agreements to purchase equity interests in target companies, such as earn-out payments or closing net asset adjustments. Alternatively, shareholder litigation may arise as a result of proposed acquisitions. Acquired businesses may have liabilities, or be subject to claims, litigation, or investigations that we did not anticipate or which exceed our estimates at the time of the acquisition. Any litigation relating to a potential acquisition will increase expenses associated with the acquisition or cause a delay in completing the acquisition, which may impact Janels profitability. Litigation related to acquisitions would also divert management time and resources. Janel may experience disruptions that could have a material adverse effect on its business and operations, especially where an acquisition target may have pre-existing compliance issues or deficiencies, or material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting.\nOur subsidiaries may not be able to fully utilize their tax benefits, which could result in increased cash payments for taxes in future periods.\nNet operating losses (\"NOLs\") may be carried forward to offset federal and state taxable income in future years and reduce the amount of cash paid for income taxes otherwise payable on such taxable income, subject to certain limits and adjustments. If fully utilized, the NOLs and other carryforwards of our minority-owned investment could provide them with significant tax savings in future periods. Their ability to utilize these tax benefits in future years will depend upon their ability to generate sufficient taxable income and to comply with the rules relating to the preservation and use of NOLs, as well as potential future changes in tax laws. The potential benefit of the NOLs and other carryforwards may be limited or permanently lost as a result of the following:\na change in control of our subsidiaries that would trigger limitations on the amount of taxable income in future years that may be offset by NOLs and other carryforwards that existed prior to the change in control; and\nexaminations and audits by the IRS and other taxing authorities could reduce the amount of NOLs and other credit carryforwards that are available for future years.\nOur actions may have an impact on the NOL's of our minority-owned investment. The inability to use these NOLs, or the diminution in value of such NOLs, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nRising interest rates may negatively impact our investments and have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve Board. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve Boards Open Market Committee (FOMC) decreased interest rates to near zero in March 2020. The low interest rate environment remained in effect until March 2022. However, in light of elevated inflation and a strong labor market, the FOMC commenced increasing the target range for the federal funds rate starting in March 2022, with total increases of 3.0% since March 2022, and announced that it would continue to battle inflation with additional increases in interest rates in 2022 and 2023.\nChanges in interest rates could have an adverse impact on our business by increasing the cost of borrowing, affecting our interest costs and our ability to make new investments on favorable terms or at all. Additionally, interest rate fluctuations and changes in credit spreads on floating rate loans may have a negative impact on our investments and investment opportunities and, accordingly, may have a material adverse effect on our rate of return on invested capital, our net investment income, our net asset value and the market price of our securities. In addition, an increase in interest rates may make it difficult or impossible to make payments on outstanding debt. Any increase in interest rates could have a negative effect on our interest costs and investments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWe may experience conflicts of interest with the minority shareholders of our businesses.\nThe boards of directors and officers of Janels non-wholly owned affiliated businesses have fiduciary duties to their respective shareholders. As a result, to the extent Janel engages in transactions with these affiliates, they may make decisions that are in the best interest of their shareholders generally, but which are not necessarily in the best interest of our shareholders. In dealings with us, the directors and officers of our affiliated businesses may make decisions that are different from the decisions we would make. These decisions may not be in the best interests of our shareholders, which may have an adverse effect on our business and operations.\nRisk Factors Related To Janels Business And Industries\n(in thousands except per share data)\nThe coronavirus pandemic has significantly impacted worldwide economic conditions and has had, and may likely continue to have, an adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to have widespread implications and while we see improvements in the broader economy, it is difficult to predict how COVID-19 will impact the overall economy in the future. We continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and geographies, including how it has and will continue to impact our customers, suppliers, employees and other business partners.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may last for a significant period of time and may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts us will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that we are not able to predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals actions in response to the pandemic; our ability to maintain sufficient qualified personnel due to employee illness, quarantine, willingness to return to work, vaccine and/or testing mandates, face-coverings and other safety requirements, general scarcity of employees, or travel and other restrictions; current global supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; and the impact on economic activity including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. These factors may adversely impact consumer, business and government spending as well as customers ability to pay for our services on an ongoing basis. This uncertainty also affects managements accounting estimates and assumptions, which could result in greater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions, including receivables and forward-looking guidance.\nJanel may not have sufficient working capital to continue operations, and our current asset-based lending facility is dependent upon an accounts receivable balance that may fluctuate as a result of national and global events.\nJanels cash needs are currently met by commercial bank credit facilities, cash on hand and cash generated from current operations. Actual short- and long-term working capital needs will depend upon numerous factors, including operating results, the availability of a revolving line of credit, competition and the cost associated with growing, either internally or through acquisition, none of which can be predicted with certainty. If results of operations and availability under Janels bank lines of credit are insufficient to meet cash needs, Janel will be required to obtain additional investment capital or debt funding to continue operations. Our substantial debt obligations could restrict our operations and financial condition. Additionally, our ability to generate cash to make payments on our indebtedness depends on many factors beyond our control.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had approximately $40,361 of short-term borrowings and long-term debt. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future.\nOur debt service obligations will require us to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal on indebtedness rather than for other corporate purposes, including funding future expansion of our business and ongoing capital expenditures, which could impede our growth. Our substantial indebtedness could have other adverse consequences, including:\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations;\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, regulatory and industry conditions, and placing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged;\nlimiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and\nexposing us to greater interest rate risk, including the risk to variable borrowings of a rate increase and the risk to fixed borrowings of a rate decrease.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness when scheduled payments are due or to fund other liquidity needs. In these circumstances, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require make-whole payments and compliance with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness or obtain additional financing would depend on, among other things, our financial condition at the time, restriction in the agreements governing our indebtedness and the condition of the financial markets and the industries in which we operate. As a result, we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Without this financing, we may have to seek additional equity or debt financing or restructure our debt, which could harm our long-term business prospects. Our failure to comply with the terms of any existing or future indebtedness could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of the payment of all of our debt.\nPursuant to the borrowing agreement, our ability to borrow under our current asset-based lending facility relies on our accounts receivable balance as collateral. This accounts receivable balance is heavily influenced by tariffs, global freight prices, international trade and other global events. Our ability to collect on these accounts receivables may further impact our ability to borrow under our current agreement. In the event that our accounts receivable balance decreases, we may face limited opportunities to borrow on our line of credit.\nOur subsidiaries do not have long-term contracts with all of their customers, and the loss of customers with which we do not have long-term contracts may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nOur businesses, especially Indco, are based primarily upon individual orders, sales and service agreements with customers-not long-term contracts. Therefore, customers could cease purchasing products or using our services at any time, for any reason, and with little or no notice, and we would have no recourse. If a significant number of our customers reduce or choose not to purchase products or use our services, or we have to lower prices to retain customers, it may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nSignificant changes or developments in U.S. laws or policies, including changes in U.S. trade policies and tariffs and the reaction of other countries thereto, may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial statements.\nSignificant changes or developments in U.S. laws and policies, such as laws and policies surrounding international trade, foreign affairs, manufacturing and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate, can materially adversely affect our business and financial statements. Under the previous U.S. administration, the imposition of significant tariffs and increased trade tension between the United States and China greatly impacted domestic industries access to foreign markets. Similar trade restrictions in the future may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial statements.\nJanels businesses face aggressive competition from other companies with greater financial resources and from companies that operate in areas in which our companies plan to expand in the future.\nOur businesses face intense competition within the logistics, manufacturing and life science industries on a local, regional, national, and global basis. Competitors include companies ranging from start-up companies, which may be able to respond to customers' needs more quickly, to large multinational companies, which may have greater financial, marketing, operational and research and development resources than Janel.\nIn the freight forwarding industry, our Logistics business competes with a large and diverse group of freight forwarding concerns, commercial air and ocean carriers and a large number of locally established companies in geographic areas where our Logistics business does business or intends to do business in the future. The loss of customers, agents or employees to competitors could adversely impact the ability of our Logistics business to be profitable. In addition, the transport of freight, both domestically and internationally, is highly competitive and price sensitive, and new competitors emerge annually. Changes in the volume of freight transported, shippers preferences as to the timing of deliveries as a means to control shipping costs, economic and political conditions (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), both in the United States and abroad, work stoppages, labor constraints (including as a result of wage inflation), U.S. and foreign laws relating to tariffs, trade restrictions, foreign investments and taxation may all have significant impact on our Logistics business overall business, growth and profitability.\nIndco competes within the highly fragmented industrial mixer manufacturing industry, which has low barriers to entry. New competitors emerge annually, and many aggressively market through electronic media. Our competitors may be more innovative than us, and, as a result, Indco may be unable to compete effectively.\nOur Life Sciences business faces significant competition across many of its product lines. To remain competitive, Life Sciences must develop new products and periodically enhance its existing products, otherwise, it may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets. We anticipate that Life Sciences may also have to adjust the prices of many of its products to stay competitive. In addition, new competitors, technologies, or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of our product lines. Failure to innovate and develop new products may impact the future sales and earnings of Life Sciences and, therefore, Janel.\nJanels businesses are dependent upon technically skilled employees, and failure to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could materially adversely affect their operations.\nJanel believes that the success of its business is highly dependent on the continuing efforts of certain technically skilled employees, particularly experienced engineers in our Manufacturing segment and scientists in our Life Sciences segment. For example, Indcos production facilities require skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for its business. Competition for the personnel required for Indcos business intensifies as activity increases. In periods of high utilization, it may become more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals. This could increase Indcos costs or have other adverse effects on its operations. Only some of our employees are subject to employment agreements. The loss of the services of technically skilled employees may have an adverse effect on Janels business and operations.\nIn order to respond to the high variability in our Logistics business model, it may be necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands. In periods of rapid change, it is more difficult to match our Logistics business staffing levels to its business needs. Additionally, there have been, and may continue to be, labor constraints as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, among other factors.\nClimate change and increased focus by governmental and non-governmental organizations, stockholders and customers on sustainability issues, including those related to climate change, may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nScientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earths atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods, wildfires and other climatic events. Our Life Sciences business operates out of three locations and our Manufacturing business in a single location. Increased frequency of extreme weather could cause increased incidence of disruption to the production and distribution of our products at these locations. Increasing natural disasters in connection with climate change could also be a direct threat to our third-party vendors, service providers or other stakeholders, including disruptions on supply chains or information technology or other necessary services for Janel. If Janels facilities, supply chains, distribution systems, or information technology systems experience any catastrophic loss as a result of such natural disasters, such event could disrupt the companys operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, diminish demand, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and significant repair or replacement expenses.\nFederal, state and local governments, as well as some of our customers, are beginning to respond to climate change issues. This increased focus on sustainability may result in new legislation or regulations and customer requirements that could negatively affect us as we may incur additional costs or be required to make changes to our operations in order to comply with any new regulations or customer requirements. Legislation or regulations that potentially impose restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning fossil fuels such as those used in the trucks in our Logistics segment, may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nMore specifically, legislative, or regulatory actions related to climate change may have a material adverse effect on Janel by increasing our Logistics business fuel costs and reducing fuel efficiency and could result in the creation of substantial additional capital expenditures and operating costs in the form of taxes, emissions allowances, or required equipment upgrades. Any of these factors could impair our operating efficiency and productivity and result in higher operating costs. In addition, revenues could decrease if we are unable to meet regulatory or customer sustainability requirements. Furthermore, on March 21, 2022, the SEC proposed new rules relating to the disclosure of a range of climate-related risks. We are currently assessing the rule, but at this time we cannot predict the costs of implementation or any potential adverse impacts resulting from the rule. To the extent this rule is finalized as proposed, we could incur increased costs relating to the assessment and disclosure of climate-related risks. These additional costs, changes in operations, or loss of revenues may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. For example, the motor carriers we contract with are subject to increasingly restrictive laws protecting the environment, including those relating to climate change, which could directly or indirectly have a material adverse effect on our business. Future and existing environmental regulatory requirements may have a material adverse effect on operations and increase operating expenses, which in turn could increase our purchased transportation costs. Our customers, our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by these new rules and costs.\nIncreases in shipping costs, long lead times, supply shortages and supply changes could disrupt our supply chain and factors such as wage rate increases and inflation can have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWe may experience supply delays and shortages due to a variety of macroeconomic factors, including disruption on the global supply chain as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, especially with respect to goods from China. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant disruption to the operations of certain suppliers in China and the related transportation of their goods to the United States that are parts of our global supply chain. We have been able to make alternative delivery arrangements for limited quantities of goods, at increased cost.\nWhile we have not yet experienced material shortages in supply as a result of these disruptions and our alternative delivery arrangements, if they were to be prolonged or expanded in scope, there could be resulting supply shortages that could impact our ability to manufacture and to deliver our products to our customers. Accordingly, such supply shortages and delivery limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFuthermore, increases in compensation, wage pressure and other expenses for our employees, may adversely affect our profitability. These cost increases may be the result of inflationary pressures that could further reduce our sales or profitability. Increases in other operating costs, including changes in energy prices and lease and utility costs, may increase our cost of products sold or selling, general and administrative expenses. Our competitive price model and pricing pressures in the industry may inhibit our ability to reflect these increased costs in the price of our products, in which case such increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nJanel may face competition from parties who sell their businesses to Janel and from professionals who cease working for Janel.\nWhile we typically enter into non-competition and non-solicitation agreements with parties that sell their businesses to us, one or more of the former owners of an acquired business who cease working for Janel or persons who leave Janels employment may compete with Janel or solicit Janels employees or clients in the future. Even if ultimately resolved in Janels favor, any litigation associated with enforcing non-competition or non-solicitation agreements could be time consuming, costly and distract managements focus from Janels business. Moreover, states and foreign jurisdictions may interpret restrictions on competition narrowly and in favor of employees. Therefore, certain restrictions on competition or solicitation may be unenforceable. In addition, Janel may decide not to pursue legal remedies if it determines that the costs or other factors outweigh the benefits of any possible legal recourse. Such persons, because they have worked for Janel or an acquired business, may be able to compete more effectively with Janel and may be more successful in soliciting its employees and clients than unaffiliated third parties.\nTerrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect any market on which the Companys shares trade, the markets in which the Companys subsidiaries operate and the Companys business operations and profitability.\nTerrorist acts or acts of war or armed conflict may have a material adverse effect on Janels business and operations. Any of these acts could result in increased volatility in, or damage to, the United States and worldwide financial markets and economy, and, in particular, could lead to increased regulatory requirements with respect to the security and safety of freight shipments and transportation. Acts of terrorism or armed conflict, and the uncertainty caused by such conflicts, could cause a reduction in demand for Janels businesses. In particular, this would have a corresponding adverse effect on Janels Logistics business.\nSecurity breaches or cybersecurity attacks may have a material adverse effect on Janels ability to operate, could result in personal information being misappropriated and may cause Janel to be held liable or suffer harm to its reputation.\nWe are dependent on information technology systems and infrastructures to carry out important operational activities and to maintain our business records. In addition, we rely on the systems of third parties. As part of our normal business operations, we connect and store certain personal identifying and confidential information relating to our customers, vendors, employees and suppliers. External and internal risks, such as malware, insecure coding, Acts of God, data leakage and human error pose a direct threat to our information technology systems and operations.\nWe, and the third parties with whom we conduct business, have faced, and may continue to be subject to, cybersecurity attacks and other intentional hacking. Any failure to identify and address such defects or errors or prevent a cyber-attack, including a ransomware attack, could result in service interruptions, operational difficulties, loss of revenues or market share, liability to customers or others, diversion of resources, injury to our reputation and increased service and maintenance costs. Addressing such issues could prove to be impossible or very costly and responding to resulting claims or liability could similarly involve substantial cost.\nIn addition, our insurance coverage and/or indemnification arrangements that we enter into, if any, may not be adequate to cover all of the costs related to cybersecurity attacks or disruptions resulting from such events. We must also rely on the safeguards put in place by customers, suppliers, vendors or other third parties to minimize the impact of cyber threats, other security threats or business disruptions. These third parties may have varying levels of cybersecurity expertise and safeguards. In the event of a breach affecting these third parties, our business and financial results could suffer materially.\nWhile, to date, we have not had a significant cyber-attack or breach that has had a material impact on our business or results of operations, we remain at risk of a data breach due, in part, to the intentional or unintentional non-compliance by a third partys employee or agent, the breakdown of a third partys data protection processes or a cyber-attack on a third partys information network and systems. Additionally, acquired companies will need to be integrated with our information technology systems, which may cause additional training or licensing cost, along with potential delays and disruption. In such event, our revenue, financial results and ability to operate profitably could be materially adversely affected. The challenges associated with integration of our acquisitions may increase these risks.\nJanel may be subject to product and other liability risks for which it may not have adequate insurance coverage.\nWe may be named a defendant in product liability lawsuits alleging that products or services provided by Janel have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to consumers, particularly for our Life Sciences and Manufacturing segment products. There are several factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims, such as the reliability and competence of the customers operators and the training of such operators. Any such third party claims and product liability claims filed against Janel could carry potential liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage. We cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover any adverse determinations in such product liability lawsuits.\nIn the ordinary course of our Logistics business, we are a defendant in several legal proceedings arising out of the conduct of our Logistics business. These proceedings include third-party claims for property damage or bodily injury incurred in connection with our services. Within our Logistics segment, ELFS maintains auto liability for commercial trucking claims of up to $6,000,000 per occurrence, and general liability with of up to $6,000,000 per occurrence. Any such third-party claims filed against ELFS could carry potential liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage. We cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover any adverse determinations in such liability claims or lawsuits.\nLife Sciences faces an inherent business risk of exposure to product and other liability claims if its products or services are alleged or found to have caused injury, damage or loss. While we retain product liability insurance, we may be unable to obtain insurance with adequate levels of coverage for potential liability on acceptable terms or claims of this nature may be excluded from coverage under the terms of any insurance policy that we obtain. If we are unable to obtain such insurance or the amounts of any claims successfully brought against us substantially exceed our coverage, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nIf Indcos customers successfully assert product liability claims against it due to defects in Indcos products, its operating results may suffer, and its reputation may be harmed. Indco faces an inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event that the failure, use or misuse of its products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury, property damage or economic loss. While Indco believes that it meets or exceeds existing professional specification standards recognized or required in the industries in which it operates, Indco has been subject to claims in the past, and it may be subject to claims in the future. A successful product liability claim or series of claims against Indco, or a significant warranty claim or series of claims against it, could materially decrease its liquidity, and, therefore, Janels financial condition. There are several factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims, such as the reliability and competence of the customers operators and the training of such operators. Any such product liability claims filed against Indco could carry potential liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage. We cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover any adverse determinations in such product liability lawsuits.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable privacy, security and data laws, regulations and standards, our business and reputation may be materially adversely affected.\nAs disclosed above, we connect and store certain personal identifying and confidential information relating to our customers, vendors, employees and suppliers. The collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information are regulated at the federal, state, international and industry levels and requirements are also imposed on us by contracts with clients. In some cases, such laws, rules, regulations and contractual requirements also apply to our vendors and require us to obtain written assurances of their compliance with such requirements. International laws, rules and regulations governing the use and disclosure of such information, such as the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation, can be more stringent than laws in the United States, and they vary across jurisdictions. In addition, more jurisdictions are regulating the transfer of data across borders and domestic privacy and data protection laws are generally becoming more onerous.\nThese laws, rules and contractual requirements are subject to change and the regulatory environment surrounding data security and privacy is increasingly demanding. Compliance with existing or new privacy, security and data laws, regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs, and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations.\nOur management information and financial reporting systems are spread across diverse platforms and geographies.\nThe growth of our business through acquisitions has resulted in our reliance on the accounting, business information and other computer systems of these acquired entities to capture and transmit information concerning customer orders, carrier payment, payroll and other critical business data. We continue to make progress towards migrating our various legacy operating and accounting systems to a singular system. As long as an acquired business remains on another information technology system, we face additional manual calculations, training costs, delays and an increased possibility of inaccuracies in the data we use to manage our business and report our financial results. Any delay in compiling, assessing and reporting information could materially adversely impact our business; our ability to react timely to changes in volumes, prices, or other trends; or to take actions to comply with financial covenants, all of which could negatively impact our stock price.\nRisk Factors Related To Janels Logistics Business\nOur Logistics business depends on third-party carriers to transport our customers cargo.\nAs a non-asset-based provider of global logistics services, our Logistics businesss ability to serve its customers depends on the availability of air and sea cargo space, including space on passenger and cargo airlines, ocean carriers that service the transportation lanes and trucking companies that our Logistics business uses. Shortages of cargo space are most likely to develop around holidays and in especially heavy transportation lanes. In addition, available cargo space could be reduced as a result of decreases in the number of airlines or ocean carriers serving particular shipment lanes at particular times. Consequently, our ability to provide services for our customers could be adversely impacted by, among other things: shortages in available cargo capacity; changes by carriers and transportation companies in policies and practices such as scheduling, pricing, payment terms and frequency of service, increases in the cost of fuel, taxes and labor, changes in the financial stability or operating capabilities of carriers and other factors not within our control. Reductions in airfreight or ocean freight capacity may have a material adverse effect on our yields. Material interruptions in service or stoppages in transportation, whether caused by strike, work stoppage, lock-out, slowdown or otherwise, may materially adversely affect our business and operations.\nWhen demand substantially exceeds available capacity in a given market, which has been increasingly common for several services and markets since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 as well as the onset of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, we may not always be able to find acceptable transportation or other service solutions to meet our customers needs, and the routing and delivery of freight may be subject to delays that are outside of our control. Quality customer service is important to our success, and any challenges in meeting our customers needs and requirements may result in loss of business, thereby materially adversely affecting our operating results.\nIn addition, any determination that our third-party carriers have violated laws and regulations could seriously damage our reputation and brands, resulting in diminished revenue and profit and increased operating costs.\nWe may be subject to claims arising from transportation of freight by the carriers with which we contract, and increased insurance premium costs may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe use the services of multiple transportation companies in connection with our transportation operations. From time to time, drivers are, or may be, involved in accidents which may cause injuries and in which goods carried by them are lost or damaged. Such accidents usually result in equipment damage and, unfortunately, can also result in injuries or death. The resulting types and/or amounts of damages may be excluded from or exceed the amount of insurance coverage maintained by the contracted carrier. Although these drivers are not our employees and all of these drivers are employees, owner-operators, or independent contractors working for carriers, from time to time, claims may be asserted against us for their actions, or for our actions in retaining them. Claims against us may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all. A material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents, liability claims or workers compensation claims, or unfavorable resolutions of claims, may materially adversely affect our operating results. A material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents, claims for lost or damaged goods, liability claims, workers compensation claims, or unfavorable resolutions of any such claims could materially adversely affect our results of operations to the extent claims are not covered by our insurance or such losses exceed our reserves. Significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could also reduce our profitability and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. The timing of the incurrence of these costs may also materially adversely affect our operating results compared to prior periods.\nAdditionally, insurance carriers may increase premiums for transportation companies generally. We may also experience additional increases in our insurance premiums in the future if our claims experience worsens. If our insurance or claims expense increases and we are unable to offset the increase with desired levels of insurance at reasonable rates, it may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nFinally, we face risks associated with the handling of customer inventory. Some of our operating agreements include maintaining the inventory of our customers. Failure to property handle such inventory could expose us to monetary claims and expenses, as well as reputational harm to our business.\nA determination that owner-operators are employees, rather than independent contractors, could expose us to various liabilities and additional costs.\nFederal and state legislation as well as tax and other regulatory authorities may seek to assert that independent contractors in the transportation service industry, such as our owner-operators, are employees rather than independent contractors. For example, on September 18, 2019, the state of California passed Assembly Bill 5 (AB5), which codified a standard test for determining a workers status as an employee or independent contractor for purposes of determining employee benefits such as paid vacation, sick leave, meals, rest breaks and overtime, known as the ABC test. The ABC test is generally thought to lower the threshold for classifying a worker as an employee as opposed to an independent contractor. A particular aspect of the ABC test poses a distinct threat to the trucking industry; the test maintains that an independent contractor must undertake work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entitys business to avoid classification as an employee. For trucking companies hiring third-party truck drivers, it is unclear whether this prong of the test is satisfied or not. In August 2022, a federal District Court formally lifted the injunction that had previously kept AB5 from applying to Californias trucking sector. The lifting of the injunction further increases the likelihood that owner-operators may be classified as employees within the state.\nWhile relatively new in California, versions of the ABC test have existed in a number of other states over the years and have been challenged in various courts as violating the federal governments exclusive right to regulate motor carriers in interstate commerce. There can be no assurance that these interpretations and tax laws that consider these persons independent contractors will not change, that other federal or state legislation will not be enacted or that various authorities will not successfully assert a position that reclassifies independent contractors to be employees. If our owner-operators are determined to be our employees, that determination could materially increase our exposure under a variety of federal and state tax, workers compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment and tort laws, as well as our potential liability for employee benefits.\nIn addition, such changes may be applied retroactively, and, if so, we may be required to pay additional amounts to compensate for prior periods. Any of the above increased costs would materially adversely affect our business and operations.\nRecessions and other economic developments that reduce freight volumes could have a material adverse impact on our Logistics business.\nThe transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession, downturns in business cycles of customers like those serviced by our Logistics business, interest rate fluctuations and other economic factors beyond the control of our Logistics business. Deterioration in the economic environment subjects our Logistics business to various risks that may have a material impact on its operating results and cause it, and, therefore, Janel, to not reach its long-term growth goals, as a result of, for example, the following:\na reduction in overall freight volumes in the marketplace, reducing our Logistics businesss opportunities for growth;\neconomic difficulties encountered by some of our Logistics business customers, who may, therefore, not be able to pay our Logistics business in a timely manner or at all, or may go out of business;\neconomic difficulties encountered by a significant number of our Logistics businesss transportation providers, who may go out of business and, therefore, leave our Logistics business unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet commitments to its customers; and\nthe inability of our Logistics business to appropriately adjust its expenses to changing market demands.\nIn addition, if a downturn in the business cycles of our Logistics business customers causes a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by those customers, its, and, therefore, Janels, operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nOther events affecting the volume of international trade and international operations may have a material adverse effect on our Logistics international operations.\nIn addition to economic conditions, our Logistics businesss international supply chain services are directly related to, and dependent on, the volume of international trade, particularly trade between the United States and foreign nations. This trade, as well as our Logistics businesss international supply chain services, is influenced by many factors, including:\neconomic and political conditions in the United States and abroad;\nmajor work stoppages;\nexchange controls, currency conversion and fluctuations;\nwar, other armed conflicts and terrorism, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict; and\nU.S. and foreign laws relating to tariffs, trade restrictions, foreign investment and taxation.\nThe foregoing and other events beyond the control of our Logistics business, such as a failure of various nations to reach or adopt international trade agreements or an increase in bilateral or multilateral trade restrictions, may have a material adverse effect on our Logistics segment.\nThe difficulty in accurately forecasting timing or volumes of customer shipments and/or rate changes by carriers could increase the cost of our operations. The unpredictability of short- and long-term fluctuations in such factors is influenced by volatile market conditions, global developments, consumer trends and numerous other factors outside of our companys direct control.\nFailure to comply with governmental permit and licensing requirements or statutory and regulatory requirements could result in civil and criminal sanctions, fines or revocation of our Logistics businesss operating authorities, and changes in these requirements may have a material adverse effect on our Logistics business.\nOur Logistics businesss operations are subject to various state, local, federal and foreign statutes and regulations prohibiting various activities that in many instances require permits and licenses. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable law and regulations, required permits or licenses, or to comply with applicable regulations, could result in substantial fines or revocation of our Logistics business operating authorities. Moreover, government deregulation efforts, modernization of the regulations governing customs clearance and changes in the international trade and tariff environment could require material expenditures or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our Logistics business specifically.\nOur Logistics business is subject to seasonal trends and other factors beyond our control.\nHistorically, our Logistics businesss operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis. Its second fiscal quarter has traditionally been the weakest, and the third and fourth fiscal quarters have traditionally been the strongest. As a result, its quarterly operating results are likely to continue to fluctuate. This trend is dependent on numerous factors, including the markets in which our Logistics business operates, holiday seasons, consumer demand, climate, economic conditions and numerous other factors. This historical seasonality has also been influenced by the growth and diversification of our Logistics business international network and service offerings. A substantial portion of our Logistics businesss revenue is derived from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand which can sometimes be difficult to predict or are based on just-in-time production schedules. Therefore, our Logistics businesss revenue is, to a large degree, affected by factors that are outside of its control. In addition, our Logistics business has several primarily variable expenses that are fixed for a period of time, and it may not be able to adequately adjust them in a period of rapid change in market demand. Our Logistics business historic operating patterns may not continue in future periods as it cannot influence or forecast many of these factors. Comparisons of our operating results from period to period are, therefore, not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance.\nFactors Related To Janels Life Sciences Business\nChanges in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products and/or increase our expenses.\nLife Sciences competes in markets in which it or its customers must comply with federal, state, local and foreign regulations, such as environmental, health and safety, and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products and/or increase our costs of producing these products.\nThe success of Life Sciences depends on its ability to continually produce products that meet high quality standards such as purity, reproducibility and/or absence of cross- reactivity.\nProduct quality and reputation are key purchasing decision factors for our Life Sciences customers. While our Life Sciences operations have experienced and qualified personnel, long operating histories and substantial production systems and protocols in place, failure on our part to meet our customers high-quality product expectations (in particular with respect to product purity, reproducibility and specificity) may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nThe success of Life Sciences is affected by its ability to maintain its intellectual property rights. If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, if third parties infringe on our intellectual property rights, or if we are involved in disputes to determine the scope and validity of others' proprietary rights, we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.\nIntellectual property rights heavily influence product development and differentiation. We own several patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others, which together are important to our business operations. However, the intellectual property rights we obtain are not always sufficiently broad and do not always guarantee a significant competitive advantage, and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned, submitted by, or licensed to us. Despite the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property, we cannot fully prevent such intellectual property from being challenged, invalidated, circumvented, designed-around or becoming subject to compulsory licensing. Sometimes, enforcement may not be available to us because a third-party may have a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons.\nWe also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. There can be no guarantee that these agreements sufficiently protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached, that we will have sufficient remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information, or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights.\nWe may also be sued by third parties alleging that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. Such lawsuits are expensive, time-consuming and divert management's focus away from other business concerns. If we are found to be infringing the intellectual property of others, we could be required to cease certain activities, alter our products or processes, or pay licensing fees, any of which could cause unexpected costs and delays that may materially adversely affect us. If we are unable to obtain a required license on acceptable terms, or if we are unable to design around any third-party patent, we may be unable to sell some of our products and services, which could reduce revenue. Additionally, if we do not prevail in such lawsuits, a court may find damages or award other remedies in favor of the opposing party, which may materially adversely affect our earnings.\nThe biomedical and life sciences industries that we serve are under constant pressures to increase the predictability of or reduce healthcare costs, all of which may materially adversely affect our business and financial results due to our role in the healthcare supply chain.\nOur Life Sciences products are sold primarily to research scientists at biomedical and life sciences companies and at academic research institutions. Development spending by our customers and the availability of government research funding can fluctuate due to changes in available resources, mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, spending priorities, general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies. Efforts to reduce or increase the predictability of healthcare costs may impact all stages of the healthcare supply chain, including the acquisition of antibodies, diagnostic reagents, diagnostic kits and other immunoreagents for biomedical research and antibody manufacturing. In addition, consolidation trends in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries have served to create fewer customer accounts and to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers. Failure to anticipate and respond to competitors actions may materially adversely affect the future sales and earnings of Life Sciences and, therefore, Janel.\nRisk Factors Related To Janels Manufacturing Business\nAny decrease in the availability, or increase in the cost, of raw materials could materially affect Indcos revenue and earnings.\nThe availability of certain critical raw materials such as motors, gear drivers, motor controls, standard hardware products, castings and steel bars, plates and shafts are subject to factors that are not within Indcos control. In some cases, these critical raw materials are purchased from suppliers operating in countries that may be subject to unstable political and economic conditions, or there may be other supply chain issues related to the procurement of such raw materials, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, international conflicts, or climate change.\nWhile Indco has historically been able to source its raw materials from an assortment of suppliers, at any given time, Indco may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of critical raw materials on a timely basis, at prices and other terms acceptable to it, or at all. If Indco is unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of required raw materials, it may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of products. This could cause Indco to lose sales, incur additional costs, delay new product introductions or suffer harm to Indcos reputation.\nIf suppliers increase the price of critical raw materials or are unwilling or unable to meet Indcos demand, it may not have alternative sources of supply. In addition, costs of certain critical raw materials have been volatile due to factors beyond Indcos control. Raw material costs are included in Indcos contracts with customers, but in some cases Indco is exposed to changes in raw material costs from the time purchase orders are placed to when it purchases the raw materials for production. Changes in business conditions may have a material adverse effect on Indcos ability to recover rapid increases in raw material costs and may materially adversely affect Indcos, and, therefore, Janels, results of operations.\nThe extensive environmental, health and safety regulatory regimes applicable to Indcos operations create potential exposure to significant liabilities.\nThe nature of Indcos manufacturing business subjects its operations to numerous and varied federal, state, local and international laws and regulations relating to pollution, protection of public health and the environment, natural resource damages and occupational safety and health. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or with the permits required for Indcos operations, could result in fines or civil or criminal sanctions, third-party claims for property damage or personal injury and investigation and cleanup costs. Potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with new environmental laws or requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future. Indco has used, and currently uses, certain substances that are considered hazardous, extremely hazardous or toxic under worker safety and health laws and regulations. Although Indco implements controls and procedures designed to reduce the continuing risk of adverse impacts and environmental, health and safety issues, Indco could incur substantial cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, and third-party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations, non-compliance or liabilities under these regulatory regimes.\nAs a manufacturing business, Indco also must comply with federal and state environmental laws and regulations that relate to the manner in which Indco stores and disposes of materials and the related reports that Indco is required to file. Indco cannot ensure that it will not incur additional costs to maintain compliance with environmental laws and regulations or that it will not incur significant penalties for failure to be in compliance.\nIndco relies on a single location to manufacture its products.\nIndcos business operates out of a single location in New Albany, Indiana. Indco employs lean manufacturing techniques and, therefore, carries little inventory. Indco could experience prolonged periods of reduced production due to unforeseen catastrophic events occurring in or around its facility in Indiana, including an outbreak of an infectious disease such as COVID-19. As a result, Indco may be unable to shift manufacturing capabilities to alternate locations, accept materials from suppliers, meet customer shipment needs or address other severe consequences that may be encountered, and Indco may suffer damage to its reputation. Indcos, and, therefore, Janels, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected were such events to occur.\nRisk Factors Related To Ownership of Janels Common Stock\nJanels officers and directors and one of its stockholders have a controlling influence over Janel.\nJanels officers and directors control the vote of approximately 61.7% of the outstanding shares of Janels common stock as of September 30, 2022, which includes Janel common stock such persons can acquire through the exercise of vested options granted to them. As a result, Janels officers and directors control the election of Janels directors and, therefore, have the ability to control the affairs of Janel. Furthermore, one particular investor in the Company has the right to appoint 50% of the members of Janels board of directors.\nAs a result, these officers, directors and stockholders have controlling influence over, among other things, the ability to amend Janels certificate of incorporation and bylaws or effect or preclude fundamental corporate transactions involving Janel, including the acceptance or rejection of any proposals relating to a merger of Janel or an acquisition of Janel by another entity. The interests of these officers, directors and stockholders may conflict with those of other stockholders. This concentration of ownership may also delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Janel, and some transactions may be more difficult or impossible without the support of these parties.\nIt is unlikely that Janel will issue dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future.\nJanel has never declared nor paid cash dividends on its common stock, and it does not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends in the future will be at the discretion of Janels board of directors.\nJanels stock price is subject to volatility.\nJanels common stock trades on the Pink tier of the OTC market under the symbol JANL. The market price of Janels common stock has been subject to significant fluctuations. There is an absence of a true market for Janel shares and thus a valid valuation is not readily maintained. This result is caused in part by the concentrated holdings of Janel, which has led to abnormal price volatility. Such fluctuations as well as economic conditions generally may adversely affect the market price of Janels common stock.\nOur common stock is not as frequently traded as compared to the volume of trading activity associated with larger companies whose shares trade on the larger national exchanges. Because of this limited liquidity, stockholders may be unable to sell their shares at the prices or volumes they desire. As a result, the trading price of our shares may occasionally fluctuate drastically. The trading price may be affected by a number of factors including events described in the risk factors set forth in this report as well as our operating results, financial condition, announcements, general conditions in the industry and the financial markets and other events or factors. In recent years, broad stock market indices, in general, and smaller capitalization companies, in particular, have experienced substantial price fluctuations. In a volatile market, we may experience wide fluctuations in the market price of our common stock. These fluctuations may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe have issued, and may continue to issue, shares of preferred stock with greater rights than our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms for those shares without the approval of our stockholders. As of September 30, 2022, for example, we had 11,368 shares of Series C Cumulative Preferred Stock outstanding. Any such preferred stock we may issue in the future could rank ahead of our common stock with respect to certain rights or obligations, including in terms of dividends and liquidation rights.\nJanel has no assurance of a continued public trading market.\nJanels common stock is quoted in the over-the-counter market on the Pink tier of the OTC market and, to the extent the market price of our common stock falls below $5.00 per share, may be subject to the low-priced security or so-called penny stock rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities. For any transaction involving a penny stock, the rules require, among other things, the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a disclosure schedule required by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stocks held in the customers account. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, to the extent we are subject to the penny stock rules, such rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. As a result, characterization as a penny stock can discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock.\nJanel incurs significant costs to comply with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, which could harm its business and results of operations.\nJanel is subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the Sarbanes- Oxley Act), and other applicable securities rules and regulations. These rules and regulations have increased, and will continue to increase, Janels legal, accounting and financial compliance costs and have made, and will continue to make, some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, these rules and regulations could make it more difficult and more costly for Janel to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and Janel may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage.\nThese rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for Janel to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on its board of directors or its board committees or as executive officers. Janels management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. As a result, managements attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm Janels business and operating results. ITEM 1B.\nUNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNot applicable.

ITEM 3.\nLEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nJanel is occasionally subject to claims and lawsuits that typically arise in the normal course of business.

The Company had 11,368 shares of Series C Stock outstanding as of September 30, 2022. ITEM 6.\nRESERVED ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOur discussions below in this Item 7 should be read along with Janels audited financial statements and related notes thereto as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 and for each of the two years in the period ended September 30, 2022 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nINTRODUCTION\nJanel is a holding company with subsidiaries in three business segments: Logistics, Life Sciences and Manufacturing. The Company strives to create shareholder value primarily through three strategic priorities: supporting its businesses efforts to make investments and to build long-term profits, allocating Janels capital at higher risk-adjusted rates of return and attracting and retaining exceptional talent. Management at the holding company level focuses on significant capital allocation decisions and corporate governance. Janel expects to grow through its subsidiaries organic growth and by completing acquisitions. We plan to either acquire businesses within our existing segments or expand our portfolio into new strategic segments. Our acquisition strategy focuses on reasonably-priced companies with strong and capable management teams, attractive existing business economics and stable and predictable earnings power.\nRecent Investment\nOn August 19, 2022, the Company acquired 1,108,000 shares of the common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Rubicon Technology, Inc. (\"Rubicon\"), at a price per share of $20.00, in a cash tender offer made pursuant to the Stock Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated July 1, 2022, between the Company and Rubicon (the \"Rubicon Purchase Agreement\"). Pursuant to the terms of the Rubicon Purchase Agreement, the acquired shares represented 44.99% of Rubicon's issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of August 3, 2022, as reported in Rubicon's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2022, filed with the SEC on August 12, 2022. The purpose of our investment in Rubicon is for Janel to acquire a significant ownership interest in Rubicon, together with representation on Rubicon's Board, in an attempt to (i) restructure the Rubicon business to achieve profitability and (ii) assist Rubicon in utilizing its NOL carry-forward assets.\nYear Ended September 30, 2022 Acquisitions\nOn August 15, 2022, the Company completed a business combination whereby it acquired all of the membership interests of ECM Biosciences LLC, which we include in our Life Sciences segment.\nYear Ended September 30, 2021 Acquisitions\nOn September 21, 2021, the Company completed a business combination whereby it acquired all of the membership interests of Expedited Logistics and Freight Services, LLC (\"ELFS\") and related subsidiaries, which we include in our Logistics segment.\nOn December 31, 2020, the Company completed a business combination whereby it acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of W.R. Zanes & Co. of LA., Inc. (W.R. Zanes), which we include in our Logistics segment.\nOn December 4, 2020, the Company completed a business combination whereby it acquired all of the membership interests of ImmunoChemistry Technologies, LLC (ICT), which we include in our Life Sciences segment.\nResults of Operations - Janel Corporation\nOur results of operations and period-over-period changes are discussed in the following section. The tables and discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto appearing in Item 8.\nRefer to Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2021, filed on December 23, 2021, for a comparison of fiscal year 2021 results of operations to the fiscal year 2020 results of operations, which specific discussion is incorporated herein by reference.\nOur condensed consolidated results of operations are as follows:\nFinancial Summary\nFiscal years ended September 30,\n(in thousands)\nRevenue\n$\n316,863\n$\n146,419\nForwarding expenses and cost of revenue\n250,666\n113,986\nGross profit\n66,197\n32,433\nOperating expenses\n56,699\n28,482\nIncome from operations\n$\n9,498\n$\n3,951\nNet (loss) income\n$\n(2,138\n)\n$\n5,203\nAdjusted operating income\n$\n12,797\n$\n5,894\nRevenue for the year ended September 30, 2022 was $316,863, or 116.4% higher than fiscal 2021. Revenue increased largely due to our Logistics segment which benefited from acquisitions and higher freight prices due to tight global shipping capacity relative to the prior fiscal year. Income from operations for fiscal 2022 was $9,498 compared to an income from operations of $3,951 for fiscal 2021, an increase of $5,547, largely as a result of our Logistics segment which benefited from acquisitions and strong demand due to tight global shipping capacity, partially offset by higher spending in the corporate segment for stock based compensation and legal fees related to the Rubicon investment. Adjusted operating income for fiscal 2022 increased to $12,797 versus $5,894 in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in Logistics profits partially offset by higher acquisition expenses at Corporate.\nThe Companys net loss for the year ended September 30, 2022 totaled $2,138 or $2.07 per diluted share, compared to net income of approximately $5,203 or $5.26 per diluted share for the year ended September 30, 2021. The decline in net income was largely due to a non-cash mark-to-market write-down of our equity investment in Rubicon, higher interest expenses and higher earn-out accruals as profit related to an acquisition were higher than expected.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of income from operations to adjusted operating income:\nAdjusted Operating Income\nFiscal years ended September 30,\n(in thousands)\nIncome from operations\n$\n9,498\n$\n3,951\nAmortization of intangible assets\n1,975\n1,120\nStock-based compensation\nCost recognized on sale of acquired inventory\nAdjusted operating income\n$\n12,797\n$\n5,894\nBUSINESS PERFORMANCE\nResults of Operations - Logistics\nOur Logistics business helps its clients move and manage freight efficiently to reduce inventories and to increase supply chain speed and reliability. Key services include arrangement of freight forwarding by air, ocean and ground, customs entry filing, warehousing, cargo insurance procurement, logistics planning, product repacking and online shipment tracking.\nFinancial Summary\nFiscal years ended September 30,\n(in thousands)\nRevenue\n$\n295,343\n$\n125,863\nForwarding expense\n242,946\n106,139\nGross profit\n$\n52,397\n$\n19,724\nGross profit margin\n17.7\n%\n15.7\n%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n$\n40,075\n$\n16,656\nIncome from operations\n$\n12,322\n$\n3,068\nFiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021\nRevenue\nTotal revenue in fiscal 2022 was $295,343 as compared to $125,863 in fiscal 2021, an increase of $169,480 or 134.7%. Of the increase in revenue, two acquisitions accounted for $102,412 of additional revenue compared to the prior year and $67,068 represented organic growth. A rise in transportation rates drove organic growth due to a shortage of transportation capacity globally. Higher prices for ocean, air and trucking services led to significant growth in both gross revenue and forwarding expenses. Our volume, as measured in ocean freight by twenty-foot equivalent units, grew 3%, air freight volume as measured by metric tons increased 17% and customs entries grew 4%. In fiscal 2023, we anticipate both gross revenue and forwarding expenses decreasing as demand is expected to decrease to match the industry's available capacity.\nGross Profit\nGross profit in fiscal 2022 was $52,397, an increase of $32,673, or 165.7%, as compared to $19,724 in fiscal 2021. Two acquisitions accounted for $26,170 of additional gross profit, while a 33% increase in organic gross profit was attributed to volume growth and higher pricing across most of our services-especially air and ocean-resulting in higher adjusted gross profits per transaction. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to 17.7% compared to 15.7% for the prior year, due to the higher gross profit margins at an acquired business partially offset by lower gross profit margins due to the increase in transportation rates.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses from continuing operations in fiscal 2022 were $40,075 as compared to $16,656 in fiscal 2021. The increase of $23,419, or 140.6%, was mainly due to additional expenses from acquired businesses and costs to support business growth. As a percentage of gross revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses were 13.6% and 13.2% for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively.\nIncome from Operations\nIncome from operations increased to $12,322 in fiscal 2022 compared to $3,068 in fiscal 2021. Income from operations increased as a result of the contribution from acquisitions, favorable industry pricing and operating leverage from revenue growth. Our operating margin as a percentage of gross profit was 23.5% in fiscal 2022 compared to 15.6% in fiscal 2021, largely due to operating leverage from significantly higher gross profit due to elevated industry demand and pricing.\nResults of Operations - Life Sciences\nThe Company's Life Sciences segment manufactures and distributes high-quality monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, diagnostic reagents and other immunoreagents for biomedical research and provides antibody manufacturing for academic and industry research scientists. Our Life Sciences business also produces products for other life science companies on an OEM basis.\nFinancial Summary\nFiscal years ended September 30,\n(in thousands)\nRevenue\n$\n11,625\n$\n11,992\nCost of sales\n2,441\n3,156\nCost recognized upon sale of acquired inventory\nGross profit\n$\n8,692\n$\n8,128\nGross profit margin\n74.8\n%\n67.8\n%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n$\n5,421\n$\n4,469\nIncome from operations\n$\n3,271\n$\n3,659\nFiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021\nRevenue\nTotal revenue was $11,625 in fiscal 2022 compared with $11,992 in fiscal 2021. Revenue decreased 3.0% or $367 primarily related to the timing of orders, in particular for diagnostic reagents.\nGross Profit\nGross profit was $8,692 and $8,128 for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of $564 or 6.9%. In the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Life Sciences segment had a gross profit margin of 74.8% and 67.8%, respectively. The increase in gross profit and the related margin reflected lower cost recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory and improved product mix. The gross profit margin was impacted by the amortization of non-cash acquired inventory expenses of $492 and $708 for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the Life Sciences segment were $5,421 and $4,469 for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The year-over-year increase was largely due to inflation, additional cost in the business to support future growth and expenses from acquired businesses. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses were 46.6% and 37.3% for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively.\nIncome from Operations\nThe Life Sciences business earned $3,271 and $3,659 in income from operations for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in operating income reflected a decline in revenue and higher expenses partially offset by favorable mix in the business. As a result of these factors, the income from operations as a percentage of revenue declined from 30.5% in fiscal year 2021 to 28.1% in fiscal year 2022.\nResults of Operations - Manufacturing\nThe Company's Manufacturing segment reflects its majority-owned Indco subsidiary, which manufactures and distributes industrial mixing equipment.\nFinancial Summary\nFiscal years ended September 30,\n(in thousands)\nRevenue\n$\n9,895\n$\n8,564\nCost of sales\n$\n4,787\n$\n3,983\nGross profit\n$\n5,108\n$\n4,581\nGross profit margin\n51.6\n%\n53.5\n%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n$\n3,095\n$\n2,696\nIncome from operations\n$\n2,013\n$\n1,885\nFiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021\nRevenue\nTotal revenue was $9,895 in fiscal 2022 compared with $8,564 in fiscal 2021, an increase of 15.5%. The revenue increase largely reflected higher product pricing implemented to address an increase in the cost of sales and an increase in volume as demand remained steady.\nGross Profit\nGross profit was $5,108 and $4,581 for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Gross profit margin for the Manufacturing segment during fiscal 2022 was 51.6%, as compared to 53.5%, in fiscal 2021. The year-over-year decrease in gross profit margin was generally due to mix of business.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the Manufacturing segment were $3,095 and $2,696 for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. As a percentage of gross revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses were 31.3% and 31.5% for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively, as expenses remained consistent with the growth of the business.\nIncome from Operations\nIncome from operations for fiscal 2022 was $2,013 compared to $1,885 in fiscal 2021, representing a 6.8% increase compared to the prior year and consistent with the growth in the business.\nResults of Operations - Corporate and Other\nBelow is a reconciliation of income from operating segments to net (loss) available to common stockholders:\nYears Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(In thousands)\nTotal income from operating segments\n$\n17,606\n$\n8,612\nCorporate expenses\n(5,342\n)\n(3,493\n)\nAmortization expense\n(1,976\n)\n(1,120\n)\nStock-based compensation\n(790\n)\n(48\n)\nTotal Corporate expenses\n(8,108\n)\n(4,661\n)\nInterest expense\n(1,276\n)\n(589\n)\nChange in fair value of mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest\n(93\n)\nFair value adjustments to Rubicon investment (net of dividends)\n(7,601\n)\n-\nChange in fair value of earnout\n(980\n)\n-\nGain on Paycheck Protection Program loan forgiveness\n-\n2,895\nNet income before taxes\n6,164\nIncome tax expense\n(2,190\n)\n(961\n)\nNet (loss) Income\n(2,138\n)\n5,203\nPreferred stock dividends\n(586\n)\n(766\n)\nNon-controlling interest dividends\n(404\n)\n-\nNet (loss) Income Available to Common Stockholders\n$\n(3,128\n)\n$\n4,437\nTotal Corporate Expenses\nCorporate expenses, which include amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and merger and acquisition expenses, increased by $3,447 to $8,108, or 74.0%, in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021. The increase was due primarily to legal and consulting costs related to the Rubicon investment, stock-based compensation related to restricted stock issuance with immediate vesting, higher accounting-related professional expense, increased merger and acquisition expenses and increases in amortization of intangible expenses. We incur merger and acquisition deal-related expenses and intangible amortization at the Corporate level rather than at the segment level.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the consolidated company increased $687, or 116.6%, to $1,276 in fiscal 2022 from $589 in fiscal 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher average debt balances to support our acquisition efforts and higher interest rates.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOn a consolidated basis, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $2,190 in fiscal 2022, as compared to an income tax expense of $961 in fiscal 2021. The increase in expense was primarily due to an increase in pretax income and the non-deductible legal consulting expense related to the Rubicon investment and utilization of prior NOL carry forwards. In 2016, a deferred tax asset was established to reflect a net operating loss carryforward. The Company fully utilized its Federal loss carryforwards in fiscal 2022 and still has a small number of state loss carryforwards that could be used in the future with ongoing profitability.\nPreferred Stock Dividends\nPreferred stock dividends include the Companys Series C Stock and dividends accrued but not paid. For the year ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, preferred stock dividends were $586 and $766, respectively. The decrease in dividends of $180, or 23.5%, was the result of the Company retiring $6,000 of Series C Preferred Stock on March 31, 2022 and the annual dividend rate change from 9% to 5%. Dividends accrued but not paid on the Companys Series C Stock were $1,745 and $2,427 as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNet (loss) Income\nNet (loss) income was ($2,138), or $2.07 per diluted share, for fiscal 2022 and $5,203, or $5.26 per diluted share, for fiscal year 2021. The decrease in net income was primarily due to an unrealized loss on the Rubicon investment, higher interest expense and the change in fair value of an earnout, partially offset by higher operating income.\nNet (loss) income Available to Common Stockholders\nNet (loss) income available to common stockholders was ($3,128) or ($3.03) per diluted share for fiscal 2022 and $4,437 or $4.48 per diluted share for fiscal 2021. The decrease in net income was primarily due to unrealized loss on the Rubicon investment, higher interest expense and the change in fair value of an earnout, partially offset by higher operating income and non-controlling interest dividend.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nGeneral\nOur ability to satisfy liquidity requirements-including satisfying debt obligations and funding working capital, day-to-day operating expenses and capital expenditures-depends upon future performance, which is subject to general economic conditions, competition and other factors, some of which are beyond Janels control. Our Logistics segment depends on commercial credit facilities to fund day-to-day operations, as there is a difference between the timing of collection cycles and the timing of payments to vendors.\nAs a customs broker, our Logistics segment makes significant cash advances for a select group of our credit-worthy customers. These cash advances are for customer obligations, such as the payment of duties and taxes to customs authorities primarily in the United States. Increases in duty rates could result in increases in the amounts we advance on behalf of our customers. Cash advances are a pass through and are not recorded as a component of revenue or expense. The billings of such advances to customers are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable from the customer and a corresponding increase in accounts payable to governmental customs authorities. These pass through billings can influence our traditional credit collection metrics. For customers that meet certain criteria, we have agreed to extend payment terms beyond our customary terms. Management believes that it has established effective credit control procedures and has historically experienced relatively insignificant collection problems.\nJanels cash flow performance for the 2022 fiscal year may not necessarily be indicative of future cash flow performance.\nAs of September 30, 2022, and compared with the prior fiscal year, the Companys cash and cash equivalents increased by $357, or 6%, to $6,591 from $6,234 as of September 30, 2021. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, Janels net working capital deficiency (current assets less current liabilities) decreased by $1,641, from ($14,784) at September 30, 2021 to ($13,143) at September 30, 2022.\nCash flows from continuing operating activities\nNet cash provided by (used in) continuing operating activities for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 was $12,107 and ($201), respectively. The increase in cash provided by operations for the year ended September, 2022 was driven principally by higher profits, timing of cash collections for accounts receivables and cash payments on accounts payables primarily in our Logistics segment for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nCash flows from investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities, mainly for the acquisition of subsidiaries, was $11,469 for fiscal 2022 and $16,108 for fiscal 2021. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2022 related to the Rubicon investment (net of dividend) and one Life Sciences acquisition. The fiscal 2021 amount was associated with two Logistics acquisitions and one Life Sciences acquisition. The Company also used $551 for the acquisition of property and equipment for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to $234 for the year ended September 30, 2021.\nCash flows from financing activities\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities was ($281) for fiscal 2022 and $19,194 for fiscal 2021. Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2022 primarily included proceeds from an increase in our amended term loan, proceeds from our private placement offering, offset by repayments on our line of credit and repurchase of Series C Preferred Stock. Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year 2021 primarily included proceeds from an increase in our line of credit-which financed our acquisition of ELFS-and proceeds from the sale of Series C Preferred Stock, partially offset by repayments on our term loan and notes payables to related party.\nCredit Facilities\nLogistics\nSantander Bank Facility\nOn October 17, 2017, the Janel Group (\"Janel Group\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and its subsidiaries, with the Company as a guarantor, entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the Santander Loan Agreement) with Santander Bank, N.A. (Santander) with respect to a revolving line of credit facility (the Santander Facility), as amended. The borrowers' obligations under the Santander Facility are secured by all of the assets of the borrowers, and the Santander Loan Agreement contains customary terms and covenants. On September 21, 2021, the Santander Loan Agreement was amended and restated by the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement by and among Janel Group and Janel Group's wholly-owned subsidiaries, ELFS and ELFS Brokerage, LLC, as borrowers (the \"Borrowers\"), the Company and Expedited Logistics and Freight services, LLC, an Oklahoma limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Janel Group, as loan party obligors, and Santander.\nAs amended and restated, the Santander Loan Agreement provided that the maximum revolving facility amount available increased from $17,000 to $30,000 (limited to 85% of the borrowers' eligible accounts receivable borrowing base and reserves, subject to adjustments set forth in the Loan Agreement), interest accrued at an annual rate equal to LIBOR (30, 60 or 90 day) plus 2.25% subject to a LIBOR floor of 75 basis points at close, with a potential LIBOR floor reduction to 25 basis points upon certain conditions; the Company was provided the option of making distributions of up to $1 million annually on its outstanding shares of Series C Cumulative Preferred Stock (the \"Series C Preferred Stock\") if specified conditions are met, and the maturity date of the Santander Facility was extended to September 21, 2026.\nOn March 31, 2022, the Santander Loan Agreement was amended to provide for, among other changes: (i) the maximum revolving facility amount available was increased from $30,000 to $31,500 (limited to 85% of the Borrowers' eligible accounts receivable borrowing base and reserves, subject to adjustments set forth in the Loan Agreement); (ii) the LIBOR basis on which interest under the Santander Loan Agreement was calculated was changed to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") and interest on the Santander Facility accrues at an annual rate equal to the one-month SOFR plus 2.75%; (iii) a one-time increase from $1 million to $3 million in the amount the Company was permitted to distribute to holders of the Company's Series C Preferred Stock if specified conditions are met; and (iv) the amount of indebtedness of the Company's Antibodies Incorporated subsidiary which the Company was permitted to guaranty was increased from $2,920 to $5,000.\nOn July 13, 2022, the Santander Loan Agreement was further amended by the Consent, Waiver and Second Amendment (the \"Second Santander Amendment\") to (i) increase the maximum revolving facility amount available to $35,000 (limited to 85% of the Borrowers' eligible accounts receivable borrowing base and reserves, subject to adjustments set forth in the Santander Loan Agreement), and (ii) provided for a new bridge term loan to the Company in the principal amount of up to $12,000 (the \"Bridge Facility\") to be funded in connection with the acquisition by the Company of up to 45% of the outstanding shares of Rubicon Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the \"Rubicon Transaction\"), subject to the satisfaction of certain customary limited conditions. The Bridge Facility was drawn on August 18, 2022 and matured on the earlier to occur of (i) twenty (20) business days following the funding of the Bridge Facility and (ii) the date of funding of the dividend to be paid by Rubicon in connection with the Rubicon Transaction. The Company repaid the Bridge Facility in full on August 30, 2022. The Second Santander Amendment also contained a one-time waiver and consent to (a) the consummation of the Rubicon Transaction, and (b) a dividend of $2,500 to be paid by Janel Group to the Company.\nAt September 30, 2022, outstanding borrowings under the Santander Facility were $26,396, representing 75.4% of the $35,000 available thereunder, and interest was accruing at an effective interest rate of 5.79%.\nAt September 30, 2021, outstanding borrowings under the Santander Facility were $29,637, representing 98.8% of the $30,000 available thereunder, and interest was accruing at an effective interest rate of 3.00%.\nThe Company was in compliance with the financial covenants defined in the Santander Loan Agreement at both September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021.\nWorking Capital Requirements\nThrough September 30, 2022, the Logistics segments cash needs were met by the Santander Facility and cash on hand. As of September 30, 2022, the Logistics segment had, subject to collateral availability, $7,400 available for future borrowings under its $35,000 Santander Facility and $1,882 in cash.\nThe Company believes that its current financial resources will be sufficient to finance the operations and obligations (current and long-term liabilities) of the Logistics segment for the short- and long-term. However, the actual working capital needs of the Logistics segment will depend upon numerous factors, including operating results; the costs associated with growing the Logistics segment, either organically or through acquisitions; competition and availability under the Santander Facility, none of which can be predicted with certainty. If cash flow and available credit are not sufficient to fund working capital, the operations of the Logistics segment will be materially negatively impacted.\nLife Sciences\nFirst Northern Bank of Dixon\nOn June 21, 2018, Antibodies Incorporated (Antibodies), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Business Loan Agreement (the First Northern Loan Agreement) with First Northern Bank of Dixon (First Northern). As amended, the First Northern Loan Agreement provides for a $2,235 term loan (the First Northern Term Loan), which bears interest at an annual rate of 4.00% and matures on November 14, 2029. In addition, Antibodies has a $750 revolving credit facility with First Northern, which currently bears interest at a variable index rate, currently 7.75% and matures on November 10, 2023 (the First Northern Revolving Loan). Antibodies also entered into two separate business loan agreements with First Northern: a $125 term loan in connection with a potential expansion of solar generation capacity on the Antibodies property (First Northern Solar Loan), bearing interest at the annual rate of 4.43% (subject to adjustment in five years) and maturing on November 14, 2029; and a $60 term loan in connection with a potential expansion of generator capacity on the Antibodies property (Generator Loan), bearing interest at the annual rate of 4.25% and maturing on November 5, 2025. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Generator Loan at September 30, 2022 and 2021. Antibodies' obligations to First Northern are secured by Antibodies' real property and are guaranteed by Janel.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the total amount outstanding under the First Northern Term Loan was $2,084, of which $2,027 is included in long-term debt and $57 is included in the current portion of long-term debt, with interest accruing at an effective interest rate of 4.18%.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the total amount outstanding under the First Northern Solar Loan was $23, of which $15 is included in long-term debt and $8 is included in the current portion of long-term debt, with interest accruing at an effective interest rate of 4.43%.\nAs of September 30, 2021, the total amount outstanding under the First Northern Term Loan was $2,139, of which $2,084 is included in long-term debt and $55 is included in the current portion of long-term debt, with interest accruing at an effective interest rate of 4.18%.\nAs of September 30, 2021, the total amount outstanding under the First Northern Solar Loan was $105, of which $101 is included in long-term debt and $4 is included in the current portion of long-term debt, with interest accruing at an effective interest rate of 4.43%.\nThe Company was in compliance with the financial covenants defined in the First Northern Loan Agreement at September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021.\nWorking Capital Requirements\nLife Sciences cash needs are currently met by the First Northern Loan Agreement and cash on hand of $1,147. The Company believes that the current financial resources will be sufficient to finance Life Sciences operations and obligations (current and long-term liabilities) for the long- and short- term. However, actual working capital needs will depend upon numerous factors, including operating results; the cost associated with growing Life Sciences, either organically or through acquisitions; competition and availability under the revolving credit facility, none of which can be predicted with certainty. If cash flow and available credit are not sufficient to fund working capital, Life Sciences operations will be materially negatively impacted.\nManufacturing\nFirst Merchants Bank Credit Facility\nOn March 21, 2016, Indco entered into a Credit Agreement (the \"First Merchants Credit Agreement\") with First Merchants Bank (\"First Merchant\"), which has been as amended.\nOn August 1, 2022, Indco and First Merchants entered into Amendment No. 3 to the First Merchants Credit Agreement, modifying the terms of Indco's credit facilities.\nUnder the revised terms, the credit facilities consist of a $5,500 term loan, a $1,000 (limited to the borrowing base and reserves) revolving loan and the continuation of a mortgage loan in the original principal amount of $680 (collectively, the \"First Merchants Facility\"). Interest will accrue on the term loan at an annual rate equal to one-month adjusted term SOFR plus either 2.75% (if Indco's total funded debt to EBITDA ratio is less than 2:1), or 3.5% (if Indco's total funded debt to EBITDA ratio is greater than or equal to 2:1). Interest will accrue on the revolving loan at an annual rate equal to one-month adjusted term SOFR plus 2.75%. Interest will accrue on the mortgage loan at a fixed annual rate of 4.19% until July 1, 2023. Indco's obligations under the First Merchants Credit Facility are secured by all of Indco's real property and other assets, and are guaranteed by Janel, and Janel's guarantee of Indco's obligations is secured by a pledge of Janel's Indco shares. The term loan and revolving loan portions of the First Merchants Credit Facility will expire on August 1, 2027, and the mortgage loan will mature on July 1, 2025 (subject to earlier termination as provided in the First Merchant Credit Agreement), unless renewed or extended.\nAs of September 30, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving loan, $5,420 of borrowings under the term loan, and $631 of borrowing under the mortgage loan, with interest accruing on the term loan and mortgage loan at an effective interest rate of 6.63% and 4.19%, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving loan, $2,713 of borrowings under the term loan, and $655 of borrowing under the mortgage loan, with interest accruing on the term loan and mortgage loan at an effective interest rate of 2.83% and 4.19%, respectively.\nIndco was in compliance with the financial covenants defined in the First Merchants Credit Agreement at both September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021.\nWorking Capital Requirements\nManufacturings cash needs are currently met by the term loan and revolving credit facility under the First Merchants Credit Agreement and cash on hand. As of September 30, 2022, Manufacturing had $1,000 available under its $1,000 revolving facility subject to collateral availability and $1,221 in cash. The Company believes that the current financial resources will be sufficient to finance the Manufacturing segment's operations and obligations (current and long-term liabilities) for the long- and short- term. However, actual working capital needs will depend upon numerous factors, including operating results; the cost associated with growing the Manufacturing segment, either organically or through acquisitions; competition; and availability under the revolving credit facility, none of which can be predicted with certainty. If cash flow and available credit are not sufficient to fund working capital, Manufacturings operations will be materially negatively impacted.\nCURRENT OUTLOOK\nThe results of operations in the Logistics, Life Sciences and Manufacturing segments are affected by the general economic cycle, particularly as it influences global trade levels and specifically the import and export activities of our Logistics segments various current and prospective customers. Historically, the Companys annual results of operations have been subject to seasonal trends which have been the result of, or influenced by, numerous factors including climate, national holidays, consumer demand, economic conditions, the growth and diversification of the segments international network and service offerings and other similar and subtle forces.\nThe Company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors, nor can it estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and, as a result, there can be no assurance that historical patterns, if any, will continue in future periods.\nThe Companys subsidiaries are implementing business strategies to grow revenue and profitability for fiscal 2023 and beyond. Our Logistics strategy calls for additional branch offices, introduction of new revenue streams for existing locations, sales force expansion, additional acquisitions and a continued focus on implementing lean methodologies to contain operating expenses. In fiscal 2023, we anticipate both gross revenue and profit declines relative to the prior fiscal year as transportation demand moderates to match the industry's available capacity.\nOur Life Sciences and Manufacturing segments expect to introduce new product lines and wider distribution and promotion of their products with internet sales efforts. In addition to supporting its subsidiaries growth plans, the Company may seek to grow by entering new business segments through acquisition.\nCertain elements of the Companys profitability and growth strategy, including proposals for acquisition and accelerating revenue growth, are contingent upon the availability of adequate financing on terms acceptable to the Company.\nWithout adequate equity and/or debt financing, the implementation of significant aspects of the Companys strategic growth plan may be deferred beyond the originally anticipated timing, and the Companys operations may be materially negatively impacted.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur accounting policies are described in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, included herein, which contains a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nBusiness Combinations and Related Acquired Intangible Assets and Goodwill. We record all tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination at fair value as of the acquisition date in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805 Business Combinations. Acquisition date fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as measured on the acquisition date. The valuations are based on information that existed as of the acquisition date. During the measurement period, which shall not exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may adjust provisional amounts recorded for assets acquired and liabilities assumed to reflect new information that we have subsequently obtained regarding facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. Such fair value assessments require judgments and estimates, which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates.\nAs part of acquisitions of businesses, we acquired certain identifiable intangible assets, which are valued as of the acquisition date using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. Key assumptions in the DCF model include (i) future revenues, (ii) earnings before interest, taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and (iii) the weighted average cost of capital discount rate. Estimated future revenues include assumptions about our ability to renew contracts in a competitive bidding process. A decrease in revenues or gross and EBITDA margins may adversely affect the value of identifiable intangible assets. The discount rate focuses on rates of return for equity and debt and is calculated using public information from selected guideline companies. The magnitude of the discount rate reflects the perceived risk of an investment. A change in the estimated risk of the acquired company cash flows would change the discount rate, which in turn could significantly affect the valuation of acquired identifiable intangible assets.\nThe excess amount of the aggregated purchase consideration paid over the fair value of the net of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change, such as material deterioration in performance that would indicate an impairment may exist. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment (step zero of the impairment test) to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we decide not to perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is more likely than not the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its the fair value, then we perform a quantitative assessment (step one of the impairment test) and calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge would be recorded to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated fair value. The decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment in a given year is influenced by a number of factors, including the significance of the excess of the reporting units estimated fair value over carrying amount at the last quantitative assessment date, the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of our acquisitions.\nNo indicators of impairment were identified from the date of our annual impairment test through September 30, 2022.\nA qualitative assessment is performed for intangibles and long-lived assets to determine if there are any indicators that the carrying amount might not be recovered. A quantitative analysis may be performed in order to test the intangibles and long-lived assets for impairment. If a quantitative analysis is necessary, an income approach, specifically a relief from royalty method, is used to estimate the fair value of the intangibles and long-lived assets. Principal factors used in the relief from royalty method that require judgment are projected net sales, discount rates, royalty rates and terminal growth assumptions.\nThe estimated fair value of each intangible and long-lived assets is compared to its carrying amount to determine if impairment exists. If the carrying amount of a intangibles and long-lived assets exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge would be recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the intangibles and long-lived assets. No indicators of impairment of our intangibles and long-lived assets were identified from the date of our annual impairment test through September 30, 2022.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nThe recent accounting standards is discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nWhile we prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we also utilize and present certain financial measures, in particular adjusted operating income, which is not based on or included in U.S. GAAP (we refer to these as non-GAAP financial measures).\nOrganic Growth\nOur non-GAAP financial measure of organic growth represents revenue growth excluding revenue from acquisitions within the preceding 12 months. The organic growth presentation provides useful period-to-period comparison of revenue results as it excludes revenue from acquisitions that would not be included in the comparable prior period.\nAdjusted Operating Income\nAs a result of our acquisition strategy, our net income includes material non-cash charges relating to the amortization of customer-related intangible assets in the ordinary course of business as well as other intangible assets acquired in our acquisitions. Although these charges may increase as we complete more acquisitions, we believe we will be growing the value of our intangible assets such as customer relationships. Because these charges are not indicative of our operations, we believe that adjusted operating income is a useful financial measure for investors because it eliminates the effect of these non-cash costs and provides an important metric for our business that is more representative of the actual results of our operations.\nAdjusted operating income (which excludes the non-cash impact of amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and cost recognized on the sale of acquired inventory valuation) is used by management as a supplemental performance measure to assess our businesss ability to generate cash and economic returns.\nAdjusted operating income is a non-GAAP measure of income and does not include the effects of preferred stock dividends, interest and taxes.\nWe believe that organic growth and adjusted operating income provide useful information in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as management. However, organic growth and adjusted operating income are not financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for total revenue, operating income or any other operating performance measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Using these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze our business has material limitations because the calculations are based on the subjective determination of management regarding the nature and classification of events and circumstances that users of the financial statements may find significant.\nIn addition, although other companies in our industry may report measures titled organic growth, adjusted operating income or similar measures, such non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from how we calculate our non-GAAP financial measures, which reduces their overall usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, you should consider organic growth and adjusted operating income alongside other financial performance measures, including total revenue, operating income and our other financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. ITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK\nConsistent with the rules applicable to smaller reporting companies, we have omitted the information required by Item 7A. ITEM 8.\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nThe financial statements and supplementary data required by this Item 8 are included in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements and set forth in the pages indicated in Item 15(a) of this Annual Report and are incorporated herein by reference. ITEM 9.\nCHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES\nNone. ITEM 9A.\nCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nJanel maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures that is designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and is accumulated and communicated to management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. The Companys management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2022, and based on their evaluation, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company\u037e (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that the Companys receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company\u037e and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, we have performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Commission. Based on this assessment, management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2022.\nThis Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Companys registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by the Companys registered public accounting firm pursuant to the exemption provided to issuers that are neither large accelerated filers nor accelerated filers under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

The executive officers are elected by the Board of Directors on an annual basis and serve under the direction of the Board. Executive officers devote all of their business time to the Companys affairs.\nDelinquent Section 16(a) Reports\nSection 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Companys directors, executive officers and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of its Class A common stock to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC and to furnish the Company with copies of all such reports they file.\nBased on the Companys review of the copies of such forms received by it, or written representations from certain reporting persons, the Company believes that none of its directors, executive officers or persons who beneficially own more than 10% of the Companys common stock failed to comply with Section 16(a) reporting requirements during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.\nBoard of Directors\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the board of directors met fourteen times. No incumbent director attended fewer than 75% of the aggregate of the total number of meetings of the board of directors of the Company and the total number of meetings held by all board committees in which that director served.\nCommittees.\nThe Companys Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Each committee operates under a charter that has been approved by the Companys board of directors and is available on its website located at www.janelcorp.com.\nAudit Committee.\nThe Companys audit committee (Audit Committee) oversees its corporate accounting and financial reporting process. The Audit Committee consists of Mr. van Kesteren as the chair, Mr. Gonzalez, Mr. Melsen and Ms. Miller Ryan. The Audit Committee met five times during fiscal 2022. The Audit Committee has the following responsibilities, among others, as set forth in the Audit Committee charter:\nreviewing and assessing the effectiveness of external auditors, their independence from Janel and any additional assignments they may be given, as well as reviewing their appointment, termination and remuneration\u037e\nreviewing and assessing the scope and plan of the audit, the examination process, audit results and reports, as well as whether auditor recommendations have been implemented by management\u037e\nrecommending the approval of the annual internal audit report, including the responses of management thereto\u037e\nassessing managements established risk assessment and any proposed measures to reduce risk\u037e\nassessing the Companys efforts and policies of compliance with relevant laws and regulations\u037e\nreviewing, in tandem with external auditors, as well as the Chief Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer, whether accounting principles and the financial control mechanisms of Janel and its subsidiaries are appropriate in view of Janels size and complexity\u037e and\nreviewing annual and interim statutory and consolidated financial statements intended for publication and recommending such financial statements to the board of directors.\nThe Companys board of directors designated Gerard van Kesteren as an audit committee financial expert considering his experience as Chief Financial Officer of Kuehne + Nagel Group. In addition, the Companys board of directors has determined that Mr. Melsens extensive experience as a partner with Deloitte and his experience as Chief Financial Officer of Healthsense, Inc. and Techne Corporation qualifies him as an audit committee financial expert. The board of directors of the Company has determined that Messrs. Gonzalez, Melsen and van Kesteren and Ms. Miller Ryan meet the definition of independent directors under the Companys criteria. The board of directors of the Company has determined that Ms. Miller Ryan and Mr. Melsen meet the Companys independence criteria for audit committee membership, which is based on the Nasdaq rules regarding audit committee independence. The board of directors of the Company, however, has determined that Mr. van Kesteren does not meet the Companys independence criteria for audit committee membership, as he received an annual $40,000 consulting fee during the fiscal year 2022 for services rendered to the Companys Logistics segment. The board of directors of the Company has also determined that Mr. Gonzalez does not meet the Companys independence criteria for audit committee membership, as he received an annual $90,000 consulting fee and cost of health insurance of $19,000 during the fiscal year 2022 for services rendered to the Companys Logistics segment.\nCompensation Committee\nThe Companys compensation committee (the Compensation Committee) formulates, reviews and recommends compensation policies that are consistent with Janels established compensation philosophy and that will enable it to attract and retain high-quality leadership.\nThe Compensation Committee met four times during fiscal 2022. The Compensation Committee has the following responsibilities, among others, as set forth in the Compensation Committees charter:\nreviewing and approving the Companys general compensation philosophy and objectives\u037e\nreviewing and approving the corporate goals and individual objectives relevant to the compensation of the Companys Chief Executive Officer and evaluating the performance of the Chief Executive Officer considering these objectives\u037e\napproving base salary amounts, incentive and bonus compensation amounts and individual stock and/or option grants and awards for the Chief Executive Officer and, based on the recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer, all corporate officers at or above the Vice President level\u037e\nreviewing all forms of compensation for the Companys senior management, including the form and amount of current salary, deferred salary, cash and non-cash benefits, and all compensation plans\u037e\nreviewing the Companys severance or similar termination payments and administering the Companys stock option and other incentive compensation plans and programs\u037e\namending or modifying, where appropriate, the provisions of any compensation or benefit plan that does not require stockholder approval\u037e\npreparing and approving reports to stockholders on compensation matters which are required by the SEC and other government bodies\u037e\nperforming an annual performance appraisal for members of the Companys senior management designated by the board of directors\u037e\nestablishing levels of director compensation to include marketplace reviews of retainers, meeting fees, stock plans and other similar components of compensation\u037e and\nannually reviewing succession plans for key positions within the Company.\nThe Companys Compensation Committee consists of Messrs.

On September 28, 2022, Ms. Miller Ryan was appointed as chair of the Compensation Committee. The Companys board of directors has determined that Messrs. Gonzalez, Melsen and van Kesteren, and Ms. Miller Ryan are independent members of the Compensation Committee.\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee\nThe Companys nominating and corporate governance committee (the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee) is responsible for developing and implementing policies and procedures that are intended to assure that Janels board of directors and the boards of directors (or equivalent) of its subsidiaries will be appropriately constituted and organized to meet its fiduciary obligations to the Company and its stockholders on an ongoing basis. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee met four times during fiscal 2022. Among other matters, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for the following, as set forth in the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees charter:\nmaking recommendations to Janels board of directors regarding matters and practices concerning the board, its committees and individual directors, as well as matters and practices of the boards, committees and individual directors of each of Janels subsidiaries\u037e\nperiodically evaluating the size, composition and governance structure of Janels board of directors and its committees and the boards and committees of Janels subsidiaries and determining the future requirements of each such body\u037e\nperiodically making recommendations concerning the qualifications, criteria, compensation and retirement age of members of Janels board of directors and the boards of its subsidiaries, which recommendations, upon approval by Janels board of directors, shall be incorporated in Janels Corporate Governance Guidelines\u037e\nrecommending nominees for election to Janels board of directors and the boards of its subsidiaries and establishing and administering a board evaluation process\u037e and\nreviewing timely nominations by stockholders for the election of individuals to Janels board of directors and ensure that such stockholders are advised of any action taken by the board of directors with respect thereto.\nThe Companys Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee consists of the Companys full board of directors. Mr. Melsen serves as the chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.\nIndependence of Directors\nThe Company is not currently subject to listing requirements of any national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system which has requirements that a majority of the board of directors be independent and, as a result, is not at this time required to (and does not) have a board of directors comprised of a majority of independent directors. Pursuant to Item 407(a) of Regulation S-K, however, Janel must disclose each director that is independent under the independence standards of either the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, as selected by Janel. The Company has elected to use the independence standards prescribed under Nasdaq Rule 5605(a)(2), which defines an independent director as a person who does not have any relationship with the Company which, in the opinion of the Companys board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Based on the applicable criteria, the Companys board of directors has determined that Mr. Killackey is not independent, as he is an employee of the Company. Ms. Schulte is not independent by virtue of the fact that she is an Executive Officer of the Company.\nThe board of directors has determined that Messrs. Gonzalez, Melsen and van Kesteren and Ms. Miller Ryan are independent directors.\nDirector Compensation\nThe following table summarizes the compensation paid to the Companys non-executive directors for their services during the Companys fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 (actual dollar amounts):\nName\nFees Earned or\nPaid in Cash(1)\nOption\nAwards(2)\nAll Other\nCompensation\nTotal\nGerard van Kesteren\n$\n50,000\n$\n47,675\n$\n40,000\n(3)\n$\n137,675\nJohn J.

Directors who also serve as executive officers of the Company do not receive additional compensation for their board service.\nCommittee chairs receive an additional retainer at an annual rate of $10,000. According to the non-employee director compensation policy, non-employee directors will be reimbursed for their reasonable travel and other expenses incurred to attend board of directors or board committee meetings.\nEmployment Arrangements\nNo active employment arrangements.\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\nThe Company has adopted a code of business conduct and ethics, including a whistleblower policy, that applies to all of its employees, including executive officers and directors. The code of business conduct and ethics, including our whistleblower policy, is available on the Companys website at www.janelcorp.com. The Company intends to disclose, if required, any future amendments to, or waivers from, the code of business conduct and ethics within four business days of the waiver or amendment through a website posting or by filing a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC.\nCorporate Governance Guidelines\nThe Companys board of directors has adopted corporate governance guidelines that serve as a flexible framework within which its board of directors and its committees operate. These guidelines cover a number of areas, including the size and composition of the board of directors, director selection criteria and qualifications, the agenda for board meetings, board member access to management and independent advisors, director compensation, director orientation and continuing education and annual board and committee self-evaluations. A copy of the corporate governance guidelines is available on the Companys website at www.janelcorp.com.\nCommunications with the Board\nAny stockholder desiring to contact the board, or any specific director(s), may send written communications to: Board of Directors (Attention: (Name(s) of director(s), as applicable)), c/o the Companys Secretary, 80 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10011. Any proper communication so received will be processed by the Secretary. If it is unclear from the communication received whether it was intended or appropriate for the board, the Secretary will (subject to any applicable regulatory requirements) use his or her judgment to determine whether such communication should be conveyed to the board of directors or, as appropriate, to the member(s) of the board of directors named in the communication.\nLeadership Structure and Risk Oversight\nWhile the board of directors believes that there are various structures that can provide successful leadership to the Company, the Companys executive functions are carried out by Ms. Schulte, the Companys President and Chief Executive Officer, who also serves as chair of the Companys board of directors and, together with the other directors, brings experience, oversight and expertise to the management of the Company.\nThe board of directors believes that, due to the small size of the Company, this leadership structure best serves the Company and its stockholders. Management is responsible for the day-to-day management of risks the Company faces, while the board of directors has collective responsibility for the oversight of risk management. In its risk oversight role, the board of directors has the responsibility to satisfy itself that the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are adequate and functioning as designed. To do this, management discusses with the board of directors the risks facing the Company and its strategy for managing them.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations, stockholders equity and its cash flows for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to an account or disclosure that is material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.\n/s/ Prager Metis CPAs, LLC\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2019\nBasking Ridge, New Jersey\nDecember 9, 2022\nJANEL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nSeptember 30,\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets:\nCash\n$\n6,591\n$\n6,234\nAccounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts\n57,077\n52,312\nInventory, net\n4,802\n3,227\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n3,423\n3,002\nTotal current assets\n71,893\n64,775\nProperty and Equipment, net\n5,044\n4,977\nOther Assets:\nIntangible assets, net\n22,420\n24,173\nGoodwill\n18,622\n18,486\nInvestment in Rubicon at fair value\n2,371\n-\nOperating lease right of use asset\n5,660\n2,936\nSecurity deposits and other long-term assets\nTotal other assets\n49,595\n46,172\nTotal assets\n$\n126,532\n$\n115,924\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY\nCurrent Liabilities:\nLine of credit\n$\n26,396\n$\n29,637\nAccounts payable -

The Company strives to create shareholder value primarily through three strategic priorities: supporting its businesses efforts to make investments and to build long-term profits; allocating Janels capital at high risk-adjusted rates of return; and attracting and retaining exceptional talent.\nManagement at the holding company focuses on significant capital allocation decisions, corporate governance and supporting Janels subsidiaries where appropriate. Janel expects to grow through its subsidiaries organic growth and by completing acquisitions. We plan to either acquire businesses within our existing segments or expand our portfolio into new strategic segments. Our acquisition strategy focuses on reasonably-priced companies with strong and capable management teams, attractive existing business economics and stable and predictable earnings power.\nLogistics\nThe Companys Logistics segment is comprised of several wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Logistics business is a non-asset based, full-service provider of cargo transportation logistics management services, including freight forwarding via air-, ocean- and land-based carriers, customs brokerage services, warehousing and distribution services, trucking and other value-added logistics services. In addition to these revenue streams are accessorial revenue to the core services. Accessorial revenue includes, but is not limited to, fuel service charges, wait time fees, hazardous cargo fees, labor charges, handling, cartage, bonding and additional labor charges.\nOn September 21, 2021, the Company completed a business combination whereby it acquired all of the membership interests of Expedited Logistics and Freight Services, LLC (ELFS) and related subsidiaries, which we include in our Logistics segment.\nOn December 31, 2020, the Company completed a business combination whereby it acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of W.R. Zanes & Co. of LA., Inc. (W.R. Zanes), which we include in our Logistics segment.\nLife Sciences\nThe Companys Life Sciences segment is comprised of several wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Companys Life Sciences segment manufactures and distributes high-quality monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, diagnostic reagents and other immunoreagents for biomedical research and provides antibody manufacturing for academic and industry research scientists. Our Life Sciences business also produces products for other life science companies on an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) basis.\nOn August 15, 2022, the Company completed a business combination whereby it acquired all of the membership interests of ECM Biosciences LLC, which we include in our Life Sciences segment.\nOn December 4, 2020, the Company completed a business combination whereby it acquired all of the membership interests of ImmunoChemistry Technologies, LLC (ICT), which we include in our Life Sciences segment.\nManufacturing\nThe Companys manufacturing segment is comprised of Indco, Inc. (Indco), a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company that manufactures and distributes mixing equipment and apparatus for specific applications within various industries. Indcos customer base is comprised of small- to mid-sized businesses as well as other larger customers for which Indco fulfills repetitive production orders.\nRecent Investment\nOn August 19, 2022, the Company acquired 1,108,000 shares (the Acquired Shares) of the common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Rubicon Technology, Inc. (Rubicon), at a price per share of $20.00, in a cash tender offer made pursuant to the Stock Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated July 1, 2022, between the Company and Rubicon (the Purchase Agreement). Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Acquired Shares represented 44.99% of Rubicons issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of August 3, 2022, as reported in Rubicons Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2022, filed with the SEC on August 12, 2022.\nRubicon is a vertically integrated, advanced materials provider specializing in monocrystalline sapphire for applications in optical and industrial systems. Rubicon uses proprietary crystal growth technology to produce high-quality sapphire products to meet customers exacting specifications.\nBasis of consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, as well as Indco, of which Janel owns 90.23%, with a non-controlling interest held by existing Indco management. The Indco non-controlling interest is mandatorily redeemable and is recorded as a liability. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUses of estimates in the preparation of financial statements\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The most critical estimates made by the Company are those relating to accounts receivables valuation, the useful lives of long-term assets, accrual of cost related to ancillary services the Company provides, accrual of tax expense on an interim basis and potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, long-lived assets impairment.\nCash\nThe Company maintains cash balances at various financial institutions. Accounts at each institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250. The Companys accounts at these institutions may, at times, exceed the federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.\nAccounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts receivable\nAccounts receivable are recorded at the contractual amount. The Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. The Company considers historical collection experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the Companys customers, any specific customer collection issues that have been identified, current economic conditions and other factors that may affect the customers ability to pay. The Company writes off accounts receivable balances that have aged significantly once all collection efforts have been exhausted and the receivables are no longer deemed collectible from the customer. The allowance for doubtful accounts as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 was $1,547 and $812, respectively.\nInventory\nInventory is valued at the lower of cost (using the first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. The Company maintains an inventory valuation reserve to provide for slow moving and obsolete inventory, inventory not meeting quality control standards and inventory subject to expiration for its Life Sciences business. The products of the Life Sciences business require the initial manufacture of multiple batches to determine if quality standards can consistently be met. In addition, the Company will produce larger batches of established products than current sales requirements due to economies of scale. The manufacturing process for these products, therefore, has and will continue to produce quantities in excess of forecasted usage. The Company values acquired manufactured antibody inventory based on a three-year forecast. Inventory quantities in excess of the forecast are not valued due to uncertainty over salability.\nProperty and equipment and depreciation policy\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost. Property and equipment acquired in business combinations are initially recorded at fair value. Depreciation is provided for in amounts sufficient to amortize the costs of the related assets over their estimated useful lives on the straight-line and accelerated methods for both financial reporting and income tax purposes. Maintenance and repairs are recorded as expenses when incurred.\nGoodwill\nThe Company records as goodwill the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Under current authoritative guidance, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates impairment may have occurred. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the Companys individual reporting units to their carrying amount to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If there is a material change in economic conditions, or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or significantly affecting the fair value of our reporting units, the Company could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future.\nWe have determined that it is impracticable to objectively determine projected cash flows and related valuation estimates that would have been used as of each July 1 of prior reporting periods without the use of hindsight. As such, the change in annual impairment test date has been prospectively applied beginning July 1, 2021.\nThe fair value of our reporting units were in excess of carrying value and goodwill was not deemed to be impaired as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nIntangibles and long-lived assets\nLong-lived assets, including fixed assets and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In reviewing for impairment, the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition.\nIf such cash flows are not sufficient to support the assets recorded value, an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived asset to its estimated fair value.\nThe determination of future cash flows, as well as the estimated fair value of long-lived assets, involves significant estimates on the part of management. If there is a material change in economic conditions, or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value, the Company could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future.\nThe Company concluded that the fair value of intangibles and long-lived assets were not deemed to be impaired as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nEquity-Method Investments\nThe Company has determined that its investment in Rubicon is subject to the equity method of accounting, and the Company has elected the fair value option under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 825-10, Financial Instruments (ASC 825-10) to account for the equity method investment. In accordance with ASC 825-10, the Company will present its equity method investment in Rubicon at fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value and dividends received from Rubicon recorded to income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate on the Companys statements of operations.\nSee Note 17 for further information about the Companys investment in Rubicons equity securities accounted for under the fair value option.\nBusiness segment information\nThe Company operates in three reportable segments: Logistics, Life Sciences and Manufacturing. The Companys Chief Executive Officer regularly reviews financial information at the reporting segment level in order to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and to assess their performance.\nRevenue and revenue recognition\nLogistics\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised services to customers. With respect to its Logistics segment, the Company has determined that in general each shipment transaction or service order constitutes a separate contract with the customer. When the Company provides multiple services to a customer, different contracts may be present for different services.\nThe Company typically satisfies its performance obligations as services are rendered at a point in time. A typical shipment would include services rendered at origin, such as pick-up and delivery to port, freight services from origin to destination port and destination services, such as customs clearance and final delivery. The Company measures the performance of its obligations as services are completed at a point in time during the life of a shipment, including services at origin, freight and destination. The Company fulfills nearly all of its performance obligations within a one to two-month period.\nThe Company evaluates whether amounts billed to customers should be reported as gross or net revenue. Generally, revenue is recorded on a gross basis when the Company is acting as principal and is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the services, when it has discretion in setting the prices for the services to the customers, and the Company has the ability to direct the use of the services provided by the third party. Revenue is recognized on a net basis when the Company is acting as agent and we do not have latitude in carrier selection or establish rates with the carrier.\nIn the Logistics segment, the Company disaggregates its revenues by its five primary service categories: ocean freight, trucking, air freight, custom brokerage and other. A summary of the Companys revenues disaggregated by major service lines for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was as follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\nService Type\nOcean freight\n$\n123,989\n$\n61,436\nTrucking\n95,333\n22,198\nAir freight\n48,312\n26,970\nCustom brokerage\n12,518\n14,424\nOther\n15,191\nTotal\n$\n295,343\n$\n125,863\nLife Sciences and Manufacturing\nRevenues from the Life Sciences segment are derived from the sale of high-quality monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, diagnostic reagents and diagnostic kits and other immunoreagents for biomedical research and antibody manufacturing. Revenues from the Companys Manufacturing segment, which is comprised of Indco, a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company that manufactures and distributes mixing equipment and apparatus for specific applications within various industries, are derived from the engineering, manufacture and delivery of specialty mixing equipment and accessories. Revenues for Life Sciences and Manufacturing are recognized when products are shipped, and risk of loss is transferred to the carrier(s) used.\nIncome (loss) per common share\nBasic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, excluding unvested restricted stock, during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share reflects the additional dilution from potential issuances of common stock, such as stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options. The treasury stock method is used to calculate the potential dilutive effect of these common stock equivalents. Potentially dilutive shares are excluded from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share when their effect is anti-dilutive.\nEquity classified share-based awards\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense for stock-based payments granted based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation- Stock Compensation. For employee stock-based awards, we calculate the fair value of the award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes method for stock options and the quoted price of our common stock for restricted shares\u037e the expense is recognized over the service period for awards expected to vest.\nStock-based compensation to non-employees\nLiability classified share-based awards\nThe Company maintains other share unit compensation grants for shares of Indco, which vest over a period of up to three years following their grant. The shares contain certain put features where the Company is either required or expects to settle vested awards on a cash basis.\nThese awards are classified as liability awards, measured at fair value at the date of grant and re-measured at fair value at each reporting date up to and including the settlement date. The determination of the fair value of the share units under these plans is described in Note 11. The fair value of the awards is expensed over the respective vesting period of the individual awards with recognition of a corresponding liability. Changes in fair value after vesting are recognized through compensation expense. Compensation expense reflects estimates of the number of instruments expected to vest. The impact of forfeitures and fair value revisions, if any, are recognized in earnings such that the cumulative expense reflects the revisions, with a corresponding adjustment to the settlement liability. Liability-classified share unit liabilities due within 12 months of the reporting date are presented in trade and other payables while settlements due beyond 12 months of the reporting date are presented in non-current liabilities.\nNon-employee share-based awards\nThe Company grants restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and stock options to certain directors, officers and employees. The Company accounts for share-based compensation as equity awards such that compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is expensed ratably over the vesting period. The fair value of restricted stock is the market price as of the grant date, and the fair value of each stock option grant is estimated as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment about, among other things, stock volatility, the expected life of the award and other inputs. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.\nThe Company issues new shares of common stock to satisfy exercises and vesting of awards granted under its stock plans. Share-based compensation expense is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as part of selling general and administrative expenses.\nMandatorily Redeemable Non-Controlling Interests\nThe non-controlling interests that are reflected as mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interests in the consolidated financial statements consist of non-controlling interests related to the Indco acquisition whose owners have certain redemption rights that allow them to require the Company to purchase the non-controlling interests of those owners upon certain events outside the control of the Company, including upon the death of the holders. The Company is required to purchase 20% per year of the mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest at the option of the holders beginning on the third anniversary of the date of the Indco acquisition, which was March 21, 2019. As of September 30, 2022, the holders had not exercised their redemption rights.\nOn December 13, 2021, two minority owners of Indco exercised 7,000 and 3,372 options to purchase Indcos common stock at an exercise price of $6.48 and $12.07 for an aggregate purchase price of $45 and $41, respectively. Indco issued related party promissory notes in the amount of $45 and $41, respectively, which bear interest at 1% per annum; both interest and principal are payable on the maturity date of December 31, 2024. On November 30, 2020, a minority owner of Indco exercised 7,000 options to purchase Indcos common stock at an exercise price of $6.48 for an aggregate purchase price of $45. Indco issued a related party promissory note in the amount of $45, which bears interest at 1% per annum\u037e both interest and principal are payable on the maturity date of December 31, 2023. These notes are included in security deposits and other long-term assets. The fair value of the shares issued of Indcos common stock was recorded as an increase in mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest. As a result of the exercise of options to purchase Indcos stock, the mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest percentage was 9.77% and 9.32% as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nOn the date the Company acquires the controlling interest in a business combination, the fair value of the non-controlling interest is recorded in the long-term liabilities section of the consolidated balance sheet under the caption Mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest. The mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest is adjusted each reporting period, if required, to its then current redemption value, based on the predetermined formula defined in the respective agreement. The Company reflects any adjustment in the redemption value and any earnings attributable to the mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest in its consolidated statements of operations by recording the adjustments and earnings to other income and expense in the caption change in fair value of mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year and (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\nThe effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities during the period in which related temporary differences become deductible. The benefit of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the Companys income tax returns are recognized in the consolidated financial statements if such positions are more likely than not of being sustained.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Assets and obligations related to operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets; current portion of operating lease liability; and operating lease liability, net of current portion in our consolidated balance sheets. Assets and obligations related to finance leases are included in property, technology and equipment, net; current portion of finance lease liability; and finance lease liability, net of current portion in our consolidated balance sheets.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Companys leases do not provide an implicit rate, the incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date is used in determining the present value of lease payments. We use the implicit rate when readily determinable. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.\nThe Companys agreements with lease and non-lease components are all each accounted for as a single lease component.\nFor leases with an initial term of twelve months or less, the Company elected the exemption from recording right of use assets and lease liabilities for all leases that qualify and records rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Expenses for these short-term leases for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 amounted to $353.\nContingent Earnout Liabilities\nThe Company accounts for contingent consideration relating to business combinations as a contingent earnout liability and a decrease (increase) to goodwill at the date of the acquisition and continually remeasures the asset or liability at each balance sheet date by recording changes in the fair value through change in fair value of contingent consideration in the consolidated statements of operations. The ultimate settlement of contingent earnout liabilities relating to business combinations may be for amounts that are materially different from the amounts initially recorded and may cause volatility in the Companys results of operations.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\nIn March 2020 and January 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2020-04, Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (ASU 2020-04), and ASU No. 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform: Scope (ASU 2021-01), respectively. Together, ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2021-01 provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions for the application of U.S. GAAP, if certain criteria are met, to contract modifications, hedging relationships, and other arrangements that are expected to be impacted by the global transition away from certain reference rates, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other interbank offered rates, towards new reference rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). The guidance in ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2021-01 was effective upon issuance and, once adopted, may be applied prospectively to contract modifications and hedging relationships through December 31, 2022. We are currently evaluating the effect that the new guidance will have on our financial position, results of operations and related disclosures.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. This standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Early adoption of the new standard is permitted\u037e however, we have not elected to early adopt the standard. The new standard is required to be applied using a cumulative-effect transition method. We are currently evaluating the effect that the new standard will have on our financial position, results of operations and related disclosures.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), which replaces the incurred loss methodology previously employed to measure credit losses for most financial assets and requires the use of a forward-looking expected loss model. Current accounting delays the recognition of credit losses until it is probable a loss has been incurred, while the update will require financial assets to be measured at amortized costs less a reserve and equal to the net amount expected to be collected. This standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Early adoption of the new standard is permitted\u037e however, we have not elected to early adopt the standard. The new standard is required to be applied using a cumulative-effect transition method. We are currently evaluating the effect that the new standard will have on our financial position, results of operations and related disclosures.\n2.\nACQUISITIONS\n2022 Acquisitions\nLife Sciences\nOn August 15, 2022, the Company completed a business combination whereby it acquired all of the membership interests of ECM Biosciences LLC (ECM), for $850, net of $16 cash received. At closing, the former member of ECM was paid $600 in cash and an additional $250 was due to the former member which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. In connection with the combination, the Company recorded an aggregate of $24 in goodwill and $222 in other identifiable intangibles. This acquisition was funded with cash provided by normal operations. The results of operations of the acquired businesses are included in the Janels consolidated results of operations since the date of the acquisition. Supplemental pro forma information has not been provided as the acquisition did not have a significant impact on Janels consolidated results of operations individually or in aggregate.\n2021 Acquisitions\nLogistics\nOn September 21, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the membership interests of ELFS and ELFS Brokerage LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ELFS. The purchase price for the membership interests was $19,000, subject to certain closing adjustments as set forth in the related purchase agreement. Further earnout payments in an amount not anticipated to exceed $4,500 will be due to the former members of ELFS based on the operating profit earned by ELFS. Upon the closing of the transaction, the former members of ELFS were paid $13,000 in cash and were issued an aggregate amount of $6,000 in subordinated promissory notes. Refer to Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for ELFS subordinated promissory notes information.\nThe ELFS acquisition was funded with cash provided by normal operations, borrowings under the Amended Loan and Security Agreement (the Santander Loan Agreement) with Santander Bank, N.A. (Santander) dated September 21, 2021, as well as subordinated promissory notes issued to the former members of ELFS. This acquisition was completed to expand our product offerings in our Logistics segment. The preliminary fair value of the consideration transferred of $21,437 was valued a of the date of the acquisition as follows: cash - $13,000; earnout payments - $3,600; and subordinated promissory notes - $4,837 (preliminary net of working capital adjustment of $1,163). In March 2022, the fair value of the consideration transferred was adjusted to $21,700, and the fair value of the subordinated promissory notes was adjusted to $5,100, in each case due to a change in the net working capital adjustment of $263.\nELFS provides a variety of logistics services, which include domestic and international freight shipping and forwarding and hazardous material warehousing and distribution. The Company is headquartered in Houston, Texas and also has other offices in Texas, Louisiana, Colorado and Oklahoma and has dedicated agents, who work in specific areas to assist in logistics, in the following locations: Texas, Louisiana, North Dakota and Oklahoma.\nPurchase price allocation\nIn accordance with the acquisition method of accounting, the Company allocated the consideration paid for ELFS to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets based on their estimated fair values. The Companys valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and the fair value amounts noted, are in the table below. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and identifiable intangible assets (in thousands).\nFair Value\nAccounts Receivable\n$\n11,017\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n2,252\nProperty & equipment, net\nSecurity deposits and other long-term assets\nOperating lease right of use asset\nGoodwill\n2,643\nIntangible assets\n10,000\nAccounts payable\n(2,399\n)\nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities\n(445\n)\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n(2,194\n)\nLong-term operating lease liabilities\n(456\n)\nTotal Consideration Paid\n$\n21,700\nThe following table summarizes, on an unaudited pro forma basis, the condensed combined results of operations of the Logistics Segment for the years ended September 30, 2021 assuming the acquisition of ELFS was made on October 1, 2020 (in thousands).\nRevenues\n$\n199,017\nForwarding expense\n158,859\nGross profit\n40,158\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n34,011\nIncome from operations\n$\n6,147\nThe foregoing unaudited pro forma results are for informational purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the actual results of operations that might have occurred had the acquisition occurred on October 1, 2020, nor are they necessarily indicative of future results.

In applying this model, we use the following assumptions:\nRisk-free interest rate - We determine the risk-free interest rate by using a weighted average assumption equivalent to the expected term based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity rate.\nExpected term - We estimate the expected term of our options on the average of the vesting date and term of the option.\nExpected volatility - We estimate expected volatility using daily historical trading data of a peer group.\nDividend yield - We have never paid dividends on our common stock and currently have no plans to do so\u037e therefore, no dividend yield is applied.\nThe fair values of our employee option awards were estimated using the assumptions below, which yielded the following weighted average grant date fair values for the periods presented:\nRisk-free interest rate\n1.10\n%\n0.46\n%\nExpected option term in years\n5.5 - 6.5\n5.5 - 6.5\nExpected volatility\n100.3% - 110.3\n%\n100.3% - 105.4\n%\nDividend yield\n- %\n-\n%\nWeighted average grant date fair value\n$\n5.57 - $6.66\n$\n6.90 - $7.19\nOptions for Employees\nNumber of\nOptions\nWeighted\nAverage\nExercise Price\nWeighted\nAverage\nRemaining\nContractual\nTerm (in years)\nAggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue\n(in thousands)\nOutstanding balance September 30, 2021\n98,994\n$\n5.93\n4.5\n$\n1,689.38\nGranted\n10,000\n$\n23.00\n9.0\n$\n-\nExercised\n(78,001\n)\n$\n5.44\n-\n$\n-\nOutstanding balance at September 30, 2022\n30,993\n$\n12.68\n6.8\n$\n1,251.45\nExercisable at September 30, 2022\n13,497\n$\n7.08\n4.6\n$\n620.53\nThe aggregate intrinsic value in the above table was calculated as the difference between the closing price of the Companys Common Stock at September 30, 2022 of $53.06 per share and the exercise price of the stock options that had strike prices below such closing price.\nAs of September 30, 2022, there was approximately $133 of total unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested employee stock options which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of two years.\nLiability classified share-based awards\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, 7,018 options were granted and 10,372 options were exercised with respect to Indcos common stock.

The accrued compensation cost related to these options was approximately $311 and $361 as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively, and is included in other liabilities in the condensed consolidated financial statement.The compensation cost related to these options was approximately $42 and $67 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively, and is included in other liabilities in the consolidated financial statement.The cost associated with the options issued on each grant date is being recognized ratably over the period of service required to earn each tranche of options.\nUpon vesting, the options continue to be accounted for as a liability in accordance with ASC 480-10-25-8 and are measured in accordance with ASC 480-10-35 at every reporting period until the options are settled.\nChanges in the fair value of the vested options are recognized in earnings in the consolidated financial statements.\nThe options are classified as liabilities, and the underlying shares of Indcos common stock also contain put options which result in their classification as a mandatorily redeemable security. While their redemption does not occur on a fixed date, there is an unconditional obligation for the Company to repurchase the shares upon death.\nAs of September 30, 2022, there was approximately $39 of total unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested Indco stock options. This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of two years.\n(B)\nRestricted Stock\nOn March 30, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an equity grant of 15,000 shares of restricted stock to an employee of the Company pursuant to the Companys Amended and Restated Plan, vesting immediately.

Income tax returns for tax years from 2017 through 2021 remain subject to examination by the taxing jurisdictions.\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law in the United States. Among other provisions, the IRA includes a 15% corporate minimum tax rate applied to certain large corporations and a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. We do not expect the IRA to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n14.\nPROFIT SHARING AND 401(K) PLANS\nThe Company maintains a qualified retirement plan commonly referred to as a 401(k) Plan covering substantially all full-time employees under each segment.\nThe Janel Corporation 401(k) allows for employee salary deferrals including Roth 401(k) deferrals, employer matching contributions, employer profit sharing contributions and employee rollovers.

As of September 30, 2022, the remaining terms of the Companys operating leases were between one and 60 months and certain lease agreements contain provisions for future rent increases. Payments due under the lease contracts include the minimum lease payments that the Company is obligated to make under the non-cancelable initial terms of the leases as the renewal terms are at the Companys option and the Company is not reasonably certain to exercise those renewal options at lease commencement.\nThe components of lease cost for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\nOperating lease cost\n$\n1,869\n$\nShort-term lease cost\nTotal lease cost\n$\n2,222\n$ 1,029\nRent expense for the year ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was $2,222 and $1,029, respectively.\nOperating lease right of use assets, current portion of operating lease liabilities and long-term operating lease liabilities reported in the consolidated balance sheets for operating leases as of September 30, 2022 were $5,660, $1,825 and $4,001, respectively.\nOperating lease right of use assets, current portion of operating lease liabilities and long-term operating lease liabilities reported in the consolidated balance sheets for operating leases as of September 30, 2021 were $2,936, $1,281 and $1,751, respectively.\nDuring the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company entered into new operating leases and recorded an additional $4,397 and $ 1,075, respectively in operating lease right of use assets and corresponding lease liabilities.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the weighted-average remaining lease term and the weighted-average discount rate related to the Companys operating leases were 4.6 years and 3.05% and 2.9 years and 3.89% respectively.\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease obligations were $1,797 and $785 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nFuture minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases as of September 30, 2022 are as follows (in thousands):\nYear End\nSeptember 30, 2022\nFiscal Year 2023\n$\n1,793\nFiscal Year 2024\n1,425\nFiscal Year 2025\n1,066\nFiscal Year 2026\nFiscal Year 2027\nThereafter\nTotal undiscounted loan payments\n6,226\nLess imputed interest\n(400\n)\nTotal lease obligation\n$\n5,826\n17.\nRUBICON INVESTMENT\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nOn August 19, 2022, the Company acquired 1,108,000 shares of the common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Rubicon, at a price per share of $20.00, in a cash tender offer made pursuant to the Stock Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated July 1, 2022, between the Company and Rubicon. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Acquired Shares represented 44.99% of Rubicons issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of August 3, 2022, as reported in Rubicons Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2022, filed with the SEC on August 12, 2022. The purchase price for the acquired Rubicon shares was $22,160 and was paid from the Companys cash on hand, proceeds of the Bridge Loan, funds available under the Santander Credit Facility and funds available under the First Merchant Facility. On August 12, 2022 Rubicon announced that, in connection with the cash tender offer by the Company for up to 45% of Rubicons issued and outstanding common stock, par value $0.001 per share, the Rubicon Board of Directors set August 23, 2022 (the Record Date) as the record date for its cash distribution of $11.00 per share of Common Stock (the Distribution). The Distribution and the Record Date was conditioned upon the consummation of the cash tender offer on August 19, 2022, and the Distribution in the amount of $12,188 was paid to the Company on August 29, 2022.\nThe Company revalued the investment in Rubicons securities on September 30, 2022 and recorded a loss of $19,789 within other income (loss), net of dividends on the Companys consolidated. Below is reconciliation for the changes to the investment in Rubicon for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nBalance as of September 30, 2021\n$\n-\nPurchase of Rubicon investment\n22,160\nFair value adjustments to Rubicon investment\n(19,789\n)\nTotal\n$\n2,371\nThe summarized financial information of Rubicon as of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 is as follows: total assets $5,340, total liabilities $2,337, total revenues $3,883, gross profit $1,505 and net income $810.\n18.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nTopic 820 established a framework for measuring fair value. That framework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under Topic 820 are described below:\nLevel 1:\nInputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company has the ability to access.\nLevel 2:\nInputs to the valuation methodology are quoted market prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market.\nLevel 3:\nInputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\nThis includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nThe following table presents the Companys assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis based on the three-level valuation hierarchy (in thousands):\nTotal fair value at\nSeptember 30, 2022\nQuoted prices in active\nmarkets for identical\nassets (Level 1)\nSignificant other\nobservable inputs\n(Level 2)\nSignificant\nunobservable inputs\n(Level 3)\nAssets:\nInvestment in Rubicon at fair value\n$\n2,371\n$\n2,371\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n2,371\n$\n2,371\n$\n-\n$\n-\nLiabilities:\nContingent earnout liabilities\n$\n4,580\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n4,580\n$\n4,580\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n4,580\nTotal fair value at\nSeptember 30, 2021\nQuoted prices in active\nmarkets for identical\nassets (Level 1)\nSignificant other\nobservable inputs\n(Level 2)\nSignificant\nunobservable inputs\n(Level 3)\nLiabilities:\nContingent\nearnout liabilities\n$\n3,600\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n3,600\n$\n3,600\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n3,600\nInvestment in Rubicon at fair value\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company held approximately 45% of the total issued and outstanding shares of Rubicon and reported its investment under the fair value method pursuant to ASC 320. Management determined that it was appropriate to carry its investment in Rubicon at fair value because the investment is traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange and has daily trading activity and is a better indicator of value. The investment in Rubicon is re-measured at the end of each quarter based on the trading price and any change in the value is reported on the income statement as a realized gain or loss in other income (expense). Refer to Note 17 to Consolidated Financial Statements for reconciliation of changes to the investment in Rubicon for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nContingent earnout liabilities\nThis liability relates to the estimated fair value of earnout payments to former ELFS owners for the earnout period ending September 30, 2022. The current and non-current portions of the fair value of the contingent earnout liability at September 30, 2022 were $1,664 and $2,916, respectively. The current and non-current portions of the fair value of the contingent earnout liability at September 30, 2021 were $1,054 and $2,546, respectively.\nRefer to Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements for ELFS acquisition information. The following table sets forth a summary of the changes in the fair value of the Companys contingent earnout liabilities, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis utilizing Level 3 assumptions in their valuation (in thousands):\nSeptember 30,\nBalance at beginning of year\n$\n3,600\n$ -\nFair value of contingent consideration recorded in connection with business combinations\n3,600\nTotal\n$\n4,580\n$ 3,600\nThe\nCompany determined the fair value of the contingent earnout liability at September 30, 2022, using forecasted results through the expected earnout period. The principal inputs to the approach include expectations of the specific businesss revenue in fiscal years 2023 through 2025 using an appropriate discount rate. Given the use of significant inputs that are not observable in the market, the contingent liability is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. There were no significant changes to this methodology during the year ended September 30, 2022.\n19.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nEmployment Agreements\nThe Company has various employment agreements, including employment agreements with the previous owners of ELFS and PhosphoSolutions.\n20.\nRISK AND UNCERTAINTIES\n(A)\nCurrency Risks\nThe nature of Janels operations requires it to deal with currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. As a result, the Company is exposed to the inherent risks of international currency markets and governmental interference. A number of countries where Janel maintains agent relationships have currency control regulations. The Company attempts to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among those agents.\n(B)\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Companys assets that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and receivables from customers. The Company places its cash with financial institutions that have high credit ratings. The receivables from clients are spread over many customers. The Company maintains an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable based on expected collectability and performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition. We have continued to experience heightened customer credit risk as a result of the negative impact to customers financial condition, employment levels and consumer confidence arising from economic disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect that our risk in this area will remain high as long as the disruptions persist.\n(C)\nLegal Proceedings\nJanel is occasionally subject to claims and lawsuits which typically arise in the normal course of business. While the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not believe that the outcome of any of these legal matters will have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\n(D)\nConcentration of Customers\nNo customer accounts for 10% or more of consolidated sales for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. No customer accounted for 10% or more of consolidated accounts receivable at September 30, 2022 and 2021.\n(E)\nAuto Insurance\nIn the ordinary course of our Logistics business, we are a defendant in several legal proceedings arising out of the conduct of our Logistics business. These proceedings include third party claims for property damage or bodily injury incurred in connection with our services. Although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate disposition of these proceedings, we do not believe, based upon the information available at this time, that these property damage or bodily injury claims, in the aggregate, will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Within our Logistics segment, ELFS, maintains auto liability for commercial trucking claims of up to $6,000 per occurrence, and general liability with of up to $6,000 per occurrence.\n21.\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nOn November 1, 2022, the Company completed a business combination whereby it acquired all of the outstanding stock of ImmunoBioScience Corporation (IBS), which we include in our Life Sciences segment. The aggregate purchase price for the outstanding stock was $4,000, subject to certain closing adjustments, as set forth in the related stock purchase agreement. At closing, $3,000 was paid in cash, while $250 is due to the former stockholder of IBS as a deferred acquisition payment upon integration. Further earnout payments-in an amount not to exceed $750-will be due to the former stockholder of IBS, based on applicable sales targets achieved during the three years post-close. IBS is a developer and manufacturer of high-quality reagents used by research and diagnostic customers. IBS was founded in 2007 and is headquartered in Mukilteo, Washington. The acquisition of IBS was completed to expand our product offerings in our Life Sciences segment."
