    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGeneral\nMesa Air Group, Inc. is the holding company of Mesa Airlines, Inc., a regional air carrier providing scheduled passenger service to 107 cities in 39 states, the District of Columbia, the Bahamas, and Mexico as well as cargo services out of Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. All of our flights are operated as either American Eagle, United Express, or DHL Express flights pursuant to the terms of capacity purchase agreements (CPAs) entered into with American Airlines, Inc. (\"American\") and United Airlines, Inc. (\"United\"), and pursuant to the terms of a Flight Services Agreement (FSA) with DHL Network Operations (USA), Inc. (DHL) (each, our \"major partner\"). We have a significant presence in several of our major partners' key domestic hubs and focus cities, including Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, and Washington-Dulles.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we operated under the CPAs and FSA, or maintained as operational spares, a fleet of 158 aircraft with approximately 306 daily departures. We also lease two (2) aircraft to a third party as of September 30, 2022. We operate 42 CRJ-900 aircraft under our capacity purchase agreement and as spares with American (the \"American CPA\"); 20 E-175LL, and 60 E-175 aircraft under our capacity purchase agreement with United (the \"United CPA\"), and three (3) Boeing 737-400F aircraft under our flight services agreement with DHL (the DHL FSA). For our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, approximately 45% of our revenues were earned under the American CPA, approximately 48% were earned under the United CPA, approximately 5% were earned from leases of aircraft to a third party and approximately 2% were earned under the DHL FSA. All our operating revenue in our fiscal year 2022 and 2021 was derived from operations associated with our American and United CPAs, DHL FSA, or from leases of aircraft to a third party.\nOur agreements provide us guaranteed monthly revenue for each aircraft under contract, a fixed fee for each block hour (measured from takeoff to landing, including taxi time) and flight actually flown, and reimbursement of certain direct operating expenses in exchange for providing regional flying on behalf of our major partners. Our agreements also shelter us, to an extent, from many of the elements that cause volatility in airline financial performance, including fuel prices, variations in ticket prices, and fluctuations in number of passengers. In providing regional flying and cargo flight services under our agreements, we use the logos, service marks, flight crew uniforms and aircraft paint schemes of our major partners. Our major partners control route selection, pricing, seat inventories, marketing, and scheduling, and provide us with ground support services, airport landing slots and gate access.\nRegional aircraft are optimal for short- and medium-haul scheduled flights that connect outlying communities with larger cities and act as \"feeders\" for domestic and international hubs. In addition, regional aircraft are well suited to serve larger city pairs during off-peak times when load factors on larger jets are low. The lower trip costs and operating efficiencies of regional aircraft, along with the competitive nature of the capacity purchase agreement bidding process, provide significant value to major airlines.\nImpact of Pilot Shortage and Attrition\nDuring our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the severity of the pilot shortage and attrition and increasing costs associated with pilot wages adversely impacted our financial results, cash flows, financial position, and other key financial ratios. One of the primary factors contributing to the pilot shortage and attrition is the demand for pilots at major carriers, which are hiring at an accelerated rate to backfill the thousands of pilots whom they offered early retirements to at the beginning of the pandemic. These airlines now seek to increase their capacity to meet the growing demand for air travel as the global pandemic has moderated. A primary source of pilots for the major US passenger and cargo carriers are the US regional airlines. As a result of the pilot shortage and attrition, the Company has increased overall hourly pay by nearly 118% for captains and 172% for new-hire first officers.\nIn response to this pilot shortage and attrition, pilot wage increases and their negative impacts on our financial results, we have implemented and continue to put in place the following plans and initiatives:\n\u25aa\nWorking collaboratively with our major partners, we have and continue to address financial and operational impacts of pilot attrition, hiring and overall associated costs.\n\u25aa\nWe established the Mesa Pilot Development Program (the \"MPD Program\") to increase the pilot throughput. We have purchased 29 state-of-the-art Pipistrel Alpha Trainer 2 aircraft, with the option to buy an additional 75 over the next year. This new fleet will be the backbone of our MPD Program to help commercial pilots accelerate their accumulation of flight hours to reach the minimum flight hours required by FAA. As part of the program, pilots will be provided with the opportunity to accumulate up to 1,500 flight hours required to fly a commercial aircraft at Mesa Airlines. Flights costs of $25 per hour, per pilot, will be fully financed by us with zero interest, providing no upfront out-of-pocket expense for flight time while the candidate is accruing the required hours to earn their ATP certificate.\n\u25aa\nWe added flight training simulators and flight training instructors to expand our training capacity to backfill pilots lost to attrition.\n\u25aa\nWe increased the hourly pay for pilots to exceed the industry average in an effort to retain current pilots and attract new pilots.\n\u25aa\nWe expanded the United Aviate program participation to include all pilots flying for Mesa. Previously, pilots had to fly under the United Express contract for a minimum of two (2) years to qualify for the flow through to United Airlines. Now, all pilots regardless of contract, are eligible to flow through to United Airlines enhancing Mesa's ability to attract and retain pilots.\n\u25aa\nWe continue to evaluate other initiatives to increase pilot recruitment and accelerate training throughput.\n\u25aa\nWe formally listed 11 of our CRJ-900 aircraft and one (1) CRJ-200 aircraft for sale to raise capital and retire debt.\n\u25aa\nWe listed 18 CRJ-700 aircraft during the reporting period, of which 10 were sold. The approximate proceeds from the sale in the quarter was $50 million.\n\u25aa\nWe initiated discussions to refinance and defer repayment of our outstanding and drawn balance on our revolving credit facility with CIT Bank, N.A which is currently due in December 2022.\n\u25aa\nWe delayed and/or deferred major spending on aircraft and engine maintenance to match the current and projected level of flight activity.\nWhile these initiatives outlined above may alleviate pressure on financial performance, there is no guarantee these initiatives will come to fruition or otherwise achieve their desired objective. See the disclosure under Note 1 - Organizations and Operations - Impact of Pilot Shortage and Attrition\" in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the above initiatives that were implemented subsequent to our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 and the disclosures under Note 18 - Subsequent Events in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of certain other agreements entered into subsequent to our fiscal year ended September 30, 2002, including an amendment to our American CPA to wind down our operations with American, an expansion of our United CPA to transition aircraft from the American CPA to operate under the United CPA, and certain other financial accommodations.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nBeginning in fiscal 2020, COVID-19 surfaced in nearly all regions around the world and resulted in travel restrictions and business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected our revenue and operating results during fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020. Any similar outbreaks in the future may have a material impact on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations in future periods. See Part II. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for discussion regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial results. Also, see Part I. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and the related notes, and in our other filings with the SEC. Our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks or uncertainties. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisk Factor Summary\nThe following is a summary of the material risk factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations:\n\u25aa\nWe are highly dependent on our agreements with our major partners and our operations may be negatively impacted if our major partners experience events that negatively impact their financial strength or operations.\n\u25aa\nReduced utilization levels of our aircraft under our agreements with our major partners would adversely impact our financial results.\n\u25aa\nIf our major partners experience events that negatively impact their financial strength or operations, our operations may be negatively impacted.\n\u25aa\nWe have a significant amount of debt and other contractual obligations, certain of which are subject to financial and other covenants.\n\u25aa\nThe loss of key personnel or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.\n\u25aa\nIf the supply of pilots to the airline industry remains constrained and pilot attrition continues to exceed historical levels, our results of operations and financial condition would be negatively impacted.\n\u25aa\nIncreases in our labor costs may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\u25aa\nOur major partners may expand their direct operation of regional jets or seek other independent airlines to service their regional aircraft needs.\n\u25aa\nWe may be limited from expanding our flying within our major partners' flight systems.\n\u25aa\nThe residual value of our owned aircraft may be less than estimated in our depreciation policies.\n\u25aa\nThe amounts we receive under our agreements with our major partners may be less than the corresponding costs we incur.\n\u25aa\nStrikes, labor disputes and increased unionization of our workforces may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and reduce our profitability.\n\u25aa\nWe face tail risk in that we have aircraft lease commitments that extend beyond our existing contractual terms on certain aircraft, and may incur substantial maintenance costs as part of return obligations on leased aircraft.\n\u25aa\nWe may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us.\n\u25aa\nMaintenance costs will likely increase as the age of our jet fleet increases.\n\u25aa\nDisagreements regarding the interpretation of our agreements with our major partners could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\n\u25aa\nIf we face problems with any of our third-party service providers, our operations could be adversely affected.\n\u25aa\nRegulatory changes or tariffs could negatively impact our business and financial condition.\n\u25aa\nThe issuance of operating restrictions applicable to one of the fleet types we operate could negatively impact our business and financial condition.\n\u25aa\nIf we have a failure in our technology or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure our business and financial condition may be adversely affected.\n\u25aa\nWe are subject to various environmental and noise laws and regulations.\n\u25aa\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\n\u25aa\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy, or make opportunistic acquisitions.\n\u25aa\nOur ability to obtain financing or access capital markets may be limited.\n\u25aa\nNegative publicity regarding our customer service could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u25aa\nRisks associated with our presence in international emerging markets may materially adversely affect us.\n\u25aa\nFuture public health threats similar to COVID-19 that negatively impact the demand for air travel could adversely impact our business.\n\u25aa\nThe airline industry is highly competitive and has undergone a period of consolidation and transition leaving fewer potential major partners.\n\u25aa\nWe are subject to significant governmental regulation.\n\u25aa\nAirlines are often affected by factors beyond their control including: air traffic congestion at airports; air traffic control inefficiencies; adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes or blizzards; increased security measures; new travel-related taxes; or the outbreak of disease; any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\u25aa\nTerrorist activities or warnings have dramatically impacted the airline industry and are likely to continue to do so.\n\u25aa\nThe occurrence of an aviation accident involving our aircraft would negatively impact our operations and financial condition.\n\u25aa\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of an investment in our stock to decline.\n\u25aa\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or publish negative reports about our business, our stock price and trading volumes could decline.\n\u25aa\nAdditional issuances of our common stock, whether by us or as a result of the exercise of our outstanding warrants, could materially affect the value of our common stock.\n\u25aa\nOur corporate charter limits certain transfers of our stock, which could have an effect on the market price and liquidity of our common stock.\n\u25aa\nWe currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock.\n\u25aa\nAs an emerging growth company, reduced disclosure and regulatory requirements applicable to us may make our stock less attractive to investors.\n\u25aa\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, increase our operating costs and divert managements attention.\n\u25aa\nWe are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis, and any future adverse findings from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFor a more complete discussion of the material risk factors relevant to us, see below.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are highly dependent on our agreements with our major partners.\nWe derive substantially all of our operating revenue from our capacity purchase agreements with our major partners. American accounted for approximately 45% and 45% of our total revenue for our fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. United accounted for approximately 48% and 52% of our revenue for our fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. A termination of either our American or United capacity purchase agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. See Item 1. Business for additional information on our capacity purchase agreements with American and United.\nIf our capacity purchase agreements with American or United were terminated or not renewed, we would be significantly impacted and likely would not have an immediate source of revenue or earnings to offset such loss. Neither American nor United are under any obligation to renew their respective capacity purchase agreements with us. A termination or expiration of either of these agreements would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows, ability to satisfy debt and lease obligations, operating revenues, and net income unless we are able to enter into satisfactory substitute arrangements for the utilization of the affected aircraft by other airline partners, or, alternatively, obtain the airport facilities, gates, ticketing and ground services and make the other arrangements necessary to fly as an independent airline. We may not be able to enter into substitute capacity purchase arrangements, and any such arrangements we might secure may not be as favorable to us as our current agreements. Operating an airline independently from our major partners would be a significant departure from our business plan and would likely require significant time and resources, which may not be available to us when needed.\nReduced utilization levels of our aircraft under our agreements with our major partners, to the extent they continue, would have a material adverse impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nHistorically, our major partners have utilized our flight operations at levels at or near the maximum capacity of our fleet allocations under the applicable CPA agreements. As previously reported, we operated at significantly lower block hours during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 due to the COVID pandemic, though we experienced a recovery in demand for air travel during the second half of fiscal 2021, which has continued into fiscal 2022.\nNotwithstanding the increase in demand for air travel, in recent periods our high level of pilot attrition and pilot training output limitations has resulted in a reduction of our block hours flown. If we continue to experience pilot attrition above historic levels, we may experience further reductions in the block hours flown under our CPAs by our major partners, and we may not be able to maintain operating efficiencies previously obtained, each of which would negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately address the pilot attrition issues or that our major partners will increase the utilization of our aircraft to historical levels in future periods if we do experience an improvement in pilot attrition. If pilot attrition persists, we may experience additional declines in utilization levels, which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur American CPA establishes minimum levels of flight operations. In prior periods, the FAA Qualification Standards and associated regulation related to pilot qualification and flight training standards have negatively impacted our ability to hire pilots at a rate sufficient to support required utilization levels, resulting in certain cases issuing credits to American pursuant to the terms of our American CPA, temporarily removing aircraft from service or performance penalties. Additionally, American may withdraw covered aircraft under certain circumstances pursuant to the terms of our American CPA.\nOur United CPA does not require United to schedule any specified minimum level of flight operations for our aircraft. Additionally, United may remove aircraft from our United CPA with 90 days' prior notice to us. While United pays us a fixed monthly revenue amount for each aircraft under contract, a significant reduction in the utilization levels of our fleet in the future or removal of aircraft from our United CPA at United's election could reduce our revenues based on the number of flights and block hours flown for United.\nContinued challenges with hiring, training, and retaining replacement pilots may lead to reduced utilization levels of our aircraft and additional penalties under our capacity purchase agreements and our operations and financial results could be materially and adversely impacted. Additionally, our major partners may change routes and frequencies of flights, which can negatively impact our operating efficiencies. Changes in schedules may increase our flight costs, which could exceed the reimbursed rates paid by our major partners. Reduced utilization levels of our aircraft or other changes to our schedules under our capacity purchase agreements would adversely impact our operating results and financial condition.\nIf our major partners experience events that negatively impact their financial strength or operations, our operations also may be negatively impacted.\nWe may be directly affected by the financial and operating strength of our major partners. Any events, such as COVID-19 or other pandemics, that negatively impact the financial strength of our major partners or have a long-term effect on the use of our major partners by airline travelers would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In the event of a decrease in the financial or operational strength of any of our major partners, such partner may seek to reduce, or be unable to make, the payments due to us under their capacity purchase or flight services agreement. In addition, in some cases, they may reduce utilization of our aircraft. Although we receive guaranteed monthly revenue for each aircraft under contract and a fixed fee for each block hour or flight actually flown, our major partners are not required to schedule any specified level of flight operations for our aircraft. If any of our current or future major partners become bankrupt, our agreement with such partner may not be assumed in bankruptcy and could be terminated. This and other events, which are outside of our control, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, any negative events that impact other regional carriers and that affect public perception of such carriers generally could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have a significant amount of debt and other contractual obligations that could impair our liquidity and thereby harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe airline business is a capital-intensive business and, as a result, we are highly leveraged. As of September 30, 2022, we had approximately $615.3 million in total long-term principal balance (including current portion of $97.2 million, of which $2.7 million pertain to finance lease obligations) and $19.4 million available for borrowing under our CIT Revolving Credit Facility. Substantially all of our long-term debt was incurred in connection with the acquisition of aircraft and aircraft engines. During our fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, our principal debt service payments totaled $114.9 million, $271.0 million, and $138.3 million, respectively.\nWe also have significant long-term lease obligations, primarily relating to our aircraft fleet, office space, and other facilities. As of September 30, 2022, we had 16 aircraft under operating leases (excluding aircraft leased at nominal amounts from United and DHL) in addition to other leases of facilities and equipment, with an average remaining term of 3.8 years. As of September 30, 2022, future minimum lease payments due under all long-term operating leases were approximately $37.2 million and future debt service obligations were $720.7 million, including finance lease obligations and interest payments.\nThe Company's substantial level of indebtedness, non-investment grade credit ratings, and the availability of Company assets as collateral for future loans or other indebtedness, which available collateral would be reduced under other future liquidity-raising transactions and was reduced during our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 as a result of CARES Act loan program borrowings, may make it difficult for the Company to raise additional capital if required to meet its liquidity needs on acceptable terms, or at all.\nThe Company is evaluating strategies to obtain the required additional funding for future operations. These strategies may include, but are not limited to, obtaining equity financing, issuing debt, entering into other financing arrangements, restructuring of operations to grow revenues and decrease expenses, or selling the aircraft held for sale. However, given the impact of the current economic condition on the U.S. financial markets, the Company may be unable to access further equity or debt financing when needed. As such, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional liquidity when needed or under acceptable terms, if at all. If the Company's liquidity is materially diminished, the Company's cash flow available to fund its working capital requirements, capital expenditures and business development efforts may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe cannot assure you that our operations will generate sufficient cash flow to make our required payments, or that we will be able to obtain financing to acquire additional aircraft or make other capital expenditures necessary for expansion. Our ability to pay the high level of fixed costs associated with our contractual obligations will depend on our operating performance, cash flow, and ability to secure adequate financing, which will in turn depend on, among other things, the success of our current business strategy, the U.S. economy, availability and cost of financing, as well as general economic and political conditions and other factors that are, to some extent, beyond our control. The amount of our fixed obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to holders of our securities, including the following:\n\u25aa\nwe must dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on applicable indebtedness which, in turn, reduces funds available for operations and capital expenditures;\n\u25aa\nour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the markets in which we compete may be limited;\n\u25aa\nwe may be at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less indebtedness;\n\u25aa\nwe are rendered more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25aa\nwe are exposed to increased interest rate risk given that a majority of our indebtedness obligations are at variable interest rates; and\n\u25aa\nour credit ratings may be reduced, and our debt and equity securities may significantly decrease in value.\nAdditionally, failure to pay our operating leases, debt or other fixed cost obligations or a breach of our contractual obligations could result in a variety of further adverse consequences, including the exercise of remedies by our creditors and lessors. In such a situation, it is unlikely that we would be able to cure our breach, fulfill our obligations, make required lease payments, or otherwise cover our fixed costs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, several of the Company's debt agreements contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to enter into, create, incur, assume, or suffer to exist any liens. See Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report for additional information regarding the Company's liquidity and capital resources as of September 30, 2022.\nWe are required to comply with certain ongoing financial and other covenants under certain credit facilities and leases, and if we fail to meet those covenants or otherwise suffer a default thereunder, our lenders and lessors may accelerate the payment of such obligations.\nUnder our (i) credit and guaranty agreement with CIT (\"CIT Revolving Credit Facility\"), we are required to comply with a minimum consolidated interest and rental coverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter during the term of such credit facility, (ii) credit agreement with EDC, we are required to comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter during the term of such credit facility, (iii) aircraft lease facility (\"RASPRO Lease Facility\") with RASPRO we are required to comply with minimum current ratio and debt ratio covenants and a minimum available cash covenant\nuntil all amounts outstanding thereunder have been paid in full, and (iv) loan and guarantee agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, we are required to comply with a minimum collateral coverage ratio, measured monthly during the term of such credit facility, and a minimum liquidity level, measured at the close of any business day during the term of such credit facility.\nFailure to comply with the terms of these credit facilities and financing arrangements and the ongoing financial and other covenants thereunder would result in an event of default (as defined in the applicable credit facility and financing agreement) and, to the extent the applicable lenders so elect, an acceleration of our existing indebtedness following the expiration of any applicable cure periods, causing such debt to be immediately due and payable. Acceleration of such indebtedness would also trigger cross-default clauses under our other indebtedness. It could also result in the termination of all commitments to extend further credit under the CIT Revolving Credit Facility. We currently do not have sufficient liquidity to repay all of our outstanding debt in full if such debt were accelerated. If we are unable to pay our debts as they come due, or obtain waivers for such payments, our secured lenders could foreclose on any assets securing such debt. These events could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe loss of key personnel upon whom we depend on to operate our business or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to retain or attract highly qualified management, technical and other personnel. We may not be successful in retaining key personnel or in attracting other highly qualified personnel. Among other things, the CARES Act imposes significant restrictions on executive compensation, which will remain in place through the date that is one (1) year after the amounts outstanding under our Loan and Guarantee Agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury are fully repaid. Such restrictions, over time, will likely result in lower executive compensation in the airline industry than is prevailing in other industries which may present retention challenges in the case of executives presented with alternative, non-airline opportunities. Any inability to retain or attract significant numbers of qualified management and other personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf the supply of pilots to the airline industry remains constrained and pilot attrition continues to exceed historical levels, our results of operations and financial condition would be negatively impacted.\nIn prior periods, the FAA Qualification Standards (and associated regulations) related to pilot qualification and flight training standards discussed in Item 1. Government Regulation dramatically reduced the supply of qualified pilot candidates and negatively impacted our ability to hire pilots at a rate sufficient to support required utilization levels under our CPAs, resulting in certain cases issuing credits to our major partners, temporarily removing aircraft from service under a CPA, or performance penalties.\nMore recently, our operations have continued to be negatively impacted by the pilot shortages that have plagued the airline industry as whole, and by the associated pilot attrition that we believe has disproportionately impacted regional airlines, including us. Our pilots continue to be recruited by other carriers, primarily the major carriers and heavy equipment cargo operators, which generally offer higher salaries and more extensive benefit programs. The magnitude of this attrition in fiscal 2022 created significant backlogs in training, further exacerbating an already challenging environment. These events have had, and continue to have, a negative impact on pilot scheduling, work hours, and the number of pilots required to support our operations.\nThere has been significant press coverage during fiscal 2022 regarding the issues stemming from the pilot shortages (namely flight cancellations and delays by the major carriers), with no airline being immune to the issues created by the pilot shortage or the associated negative press. As we have in the past, we are taking important steps to further attract, hire and retain qualified pilots, including the ongoing implementation of significant pilot wage and bonus increases, pilot retention initiatives, increases in training capacity, and other cost efficiency initiatives. Notwithstanding these steps, our current rate of hiring has not kept pace with attrition. As such, even with increases in training capacity we are not currently able to hire qualified pilots at a rate sufficient to fill all available classroom training spaces, which in turn has negatively impacted the number of pilots available for scheduled operations. No assurance can be given that the measures we are currently taking or may take in the future will enable us to attract, hire and train pilots at a rate necessary to support our operations.\nIn August 2022, we entered into a Letter of Agreement with the Airline Pilots Association (ALPA), which provided for increased overall hourly pay increases of nearly 118% for captains and 172% for new-hire first officers. While we remain engaged in negotiations with ALPA over other areas of our collective bargaining agreement with ALPA, we believe these pay increases will positively impact our ability to attract, hire, and retain pilots in future periods.\nIn addition to the foregoing, our pilot premium wage and bonus initiatives have substantially increased our labor costs and continue to negatively impact our operations and financial condition. Other regional air carriers have implemented similar measures, which has only served to increase the competition for qualified pilots and the costs associated with hiring pilots. We expect these increased costs, to the extent they persist, to materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations in future periods.\nIf the high levels of pilot attrition persist and we are unable to attract, hire and retain pilots at a rate sufficient to support required utilization levels under our CPAs, we may be required to issue credits or provide offsets to our major partners, as we have done in the past, and to reduced flight schedules with our major partners, which has resulted in and may continue to result in monetary performance penalties under our CPAs, as well as give rise to the ability of our major partners in certain circumstances to elect to remove aircraft from the scope of our CPAs. Should any of these events arise in the future, they could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nMechanic attrition, together with difficulty recruiting and retaining qualified maintenance technicians, may negatively affect our operations and financial condition.\nOur operations rely on qualified personnel, including maintenance technicians. Our maintenance technicians may seek employment at mainline airlines, which generally offer higher salaries and more extensive benefit programs than regional airlines are financially able to offer. Should the turnover of maintenance technicians increase, we may not be able to hire sufficient maintenance technicians to replace those leaving. Additionally, FAA regulations regarding personnel certification and qualifications, and potential future changes in FAA regulations, could limit the number of qualified new entrants that we could hire. In the event we are unable to hire and retain qualified mechanics, our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIncreases in our labor costs, which constitute a substantial portion of our total operating costs, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a result of the FAA Qualification Standards, the supply of qualified pilots has been dramatically reduced. This shortage of pilots has driven up our pilot salaries and sign-on bonuses and resulted in a material increase in our labor costs. A continued shortage of pilots could require us to further increase our labor costs, which would result in a material reduction in our earnings.\nOur major partners may expand their direct operation of regional jets or seek other independent airlines to service their regional aircraft needs, thus limiting the expansion of our relationships with them.\nWe depend on our major partners electing to contract with us instead of operating their own regional jets or operating their own \"captive\" regional airlines through wholly owned subsidiaries. Currently, the captive regional airlines include Endeavor (owned by Delta), Envoy (owned by American), PSA (owned by American), Piedmont (owned by American), and Horizon (owned by Alaska). These major airlines possess the financial and other resources to acquire and operate their own regional jets, create, or grow their own captive regional airlines, or acquire other regional air carriers instead of entering into contracts with us. In particular, American, which procures approximately 40% of its regional flying from its wholly owned regional subsidiaries, has expressed a goal of increasing its share to a majority of American's regional flying over time. We have no guarantee that in the future our major partners will choose to enter into contracts with us, or renew their existing agreements with us, instead of operating their own regional jets, allocating flying to their captive regional airlines, or entering into relationships with competing regional airlines. A decision by American or United to phase out or limit our capacity purchase agreements or to enter into similar agreements with our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe may be limited from expanding our flying within our major partners' flight systems and there are constraints on our ability to provide services to airlines other than American and United.\nAdditional growth opportunities within our major partners' flight systems are limited by various factors, including a limited number of independent regional aircraft that each such major partner can operate in its regional network due to \"scope\" clauses in the current collective bargaining agreements with their pilots that restrict the number and size of regional jets that may be operated in their flight systems not flown by their pilots. Except as contemplated by our existing agreements, we cannot be sure that our major partners will contract with us to fly any additional aircraft.\nWe may not have additional growth opportunities or may agree to modifications to our agreements that reduce certain benefits to us in order to obtain additional aircraft, or for other reasons. Given the competitive nature of the airline industry, we believe limited growth opportunities may result in competitors accepting reduced margins and less favorable contract terms in order to secure new or additional capacity purchase operations. Even if we are offered growth opportunities by our major partners, those opportunities may involve economic terms or financing commitments that are unacceptable to us.\nAdditionally, our major partners may reduce the number of regional jets in their system by not renewing or extending existing flying arrangements with regional operators or transitioning those flying arrangements to their own captive regional carriers. Any one or more of these factors may reduce or eliminate our ability to expand our flight operations with our existing major partners.\nAdditionally, our capacity purchase agreements limit our ability to provide regional flying services to other airlines in certain major airport hubs of American and United. These restrictions may make us a less attractive partner to other major airlines whose regional flying needs do not align with our geographical restrictions.\nThe residual value of our owned aircraft may be less than estimated in our depreciation policies.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had approximately $865.3 million of property and equipment and related assets, net of accumulated depreciation, of which $660.8 million relates to aircraft. In accounting for these long-lived assets, we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, the expected residual values of certain of these assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate. Factors indicating potential impairment include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the long-lived assets, a significant change in the condition of the long-lived assets and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long-lived assets. In the event the estimated residual value of any of our aircraft types is determined to be lower than the residual value assumptions used in our depreciation policies, the applicable aircraft type in our fleet may be impaired and may result in a material reduction in the book value of applicable aircraft types we operate or we may need to prospectively modify our depreciation policies. An impairment on any of the aircraft types we operate or an increased level of depreciation expense resulting from a change to our depreciation policies could result in a material negative impact to our financial results. For our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we recognized approximately $109.7 million of impairment losses on our owned and leased aircraft and related assets. See Note 8 - Balance Sheet Information in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our impairment of long-lived assets.\nThe amounts we receive under our agreements may be less than the corresponding costs we incur.\nUnder our capacity purchase agreements with American and United and flight services agreement with DHL, a portion of our compensation is based upon pre-determined rates typically applied to production statistics (such as departures and block hours flown). The primary operating costs intended to be compensated by the pre-determined rates include labor costs, including crew training costs, certain aircraft maintenance expenses and overhead costs. During our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, approximately $51.4 million, or 8.5%, of our operating costs under our agreements were pass-through costs, excluding fuel which is paid directly to suppliers by our major partners. If our operating costs for labor, aircraft maintenance and overhead costs exceed the compensation earned from our pre-determined rates under our agreements, our financial position and operating results will be negatively affected.\nStrikes, labor disputes and increased unionization of our workforces may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and reduce our profitability.\nAs of September 30, 2022, approximately 66.9% of our workforce was represented by labor unions, including the Air Line Pilots Association, International (\"ALPA\") and the Association of Flight Attendants (\"AFA\"). In August 2022, we entered into a Letter of Agreement with the Airline Pilots Association (ALPA), which provided for increased overall hourly pay increases of nearly 118% for captains and 172% for new-hire first officers. While we remain engaged in negotiations with ALPA over other areas of our collective bargaining agreement, we believe these pay increases will positively impact our ability to attract, hire, and retain pilots in future periods.\nThe inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with existing unions or with new unions could result in work stoppages by the affected workers, lost revenues resulting from the cancellation of flights and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members. The terms and conditions of our future collective bargaining agreements may be affected by the results of collective bargaining negotiations at other airlines that may have a greater ability, due to larger scale, greater efficiency or other factors, to bear higher costs than we can. In addition, if we are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups in future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements, we may be subject to work interruptions, stoppages, or shortages. We may also become subject to additional collective bargaining agreements in the future as non-unionized workers may unionize. We are also subject to various ongoing employment disputes outside of the collective bargaining agreements. We consider these disputes to not be material, but any current or future dispute could become material.\nRelations between air carriers and labor unions in the United States are governed by the RLA. Under the RLA, collective bargaining agreements generally contain \"amendable dates\" rather than expiration dates, and the RLA requires that a carrier maintain the existing terms and conditions of employment following the amendable date through a multi-stage and usually lengthy series of bargaining processes overseen by the NMB. This process continues until either the parties\nhave reached agreement on a new collective bargaining agreement, or the parties have been released to \"self-help\" by the NMB. In most circumstances, the RLA prohibits strikes; however, after release by the NMB, carriers and unions are free to engage in self-help measures such as lockouts and strikes.\nAny strike, labor dispute or increased unionization among our employees could disrupt our operations, reduce our profitability, or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies. For example, if a labor strike were to continue for several consecutive days, our major partners may have cause to terminate the applicable CPA. As a result, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nWe face tail risk in that we have aircraft lease commitments that extend beyond our existing contractual terms on certain aircraft.\nWe currently have aircraft with leases extending past the term of their corresponding agreement. We may not be successful in extending the flying contract terms on these aircraft with our major partners. In that event, we intend to pursue alternative uses for those aircraft over the remaining portions of their leases including, but not limited to, operating the aircraft with another major airline under a negotiated capacity purchase agreement, subleasing the aircraft to another operator or marketing them for sale. Additionally, we may negotiate an early lease return agreement with an aircraft's lessor. In such event, we may incur cash and non-cash early lease termination costs that would negatively impact our operations and financial condition. Additionally, if we are unable to extend a flying contract with an existing major partner but reach an agreement to place an aircraft into service with a different major partner, we likely will incur inefficiencies and incremental costs, such as changing the aircraft livery, which would negatively impact our financial results.\nWe may incur substantial maintenance costs as part of our leased aircraft return obligations.\nOur aircraft lease agreements contain provisions that require us to return aircraft airframes and engines to the lessor in a specified condition or pay an amount to the lessor based on the actual return condition of the equipment. These lease return costs are recorded in the period in which they are incurred. We estimate the cost of maintenance lease return obligations and accrue such costs over the remaining lease term when the expense is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Any unexpected increase in maintenance return costs may negatively impact our financial position and results of operations.\nWe may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including employment, commercial, product liability, class action, whistleblower and other litigation and claims, and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. Such matters can be time-consuming, divert management's attention and resources, cause us to incur significant expenses or liability and/or require us to change our business practices. Because of the potential risks, expenses, and uncertainties of litigation, we may, from time to time, settle disputes, even where we believe that we have meritorious claims or defenses. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDisagreements regarding the interpretation of our agreements with our major partners could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nTo the extent that we experience disagreements regarding the interpretation of our capacity purchase or other agreements, we will likely expend valuable management time and financial resources in our efforts to resolve those disagreements. Those disagreements may result in litigation, arbitration, settlement negotiations, or other proceedings. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any or all of those proceedings, if commenced, would be resolved in our favor or that we would be able to exercise sufficient leverage in any proceeding relative to our major partner to achieve a favorable outcome. An unfavorable result in any such proceeding could have adverse financial consequences or require us to modify our operations. Such disagreements and their consequences could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers as the sole manufacturers of our aircraft and aircraft engines.\nWe depend upon MHI, Boeing, and Embraer as the sole manufacturers of our aircraft and GE as the sole manufacturer of our aircraft engines. Our operations could be materially and adversely affected by the failure or inability of MHI, Boeing, Embraer or GE to provide sufficient parts or related maintenance and support services to us in a timely manner, or the interruption of our flight operations as a result of unscheduled or unanticipated maintenance requirements for our aircraft or engines.\nMaintenance costs will likely increase as the age of our jet fleet increases.\nThe average age of our E-175, CRJ-900, Boeing 737 and CRJ-700 type aircraft is approximately 6.9, 16.0, 29.0, and 17.5 years, respectively. We have incurred relatively low maintenance expenses on our E-175 aircraft because most of the parts are under multi-year warranties and a limited number of heavy airframe checks and engine overhauls have occurred. Our maintenance costs will increase significantly, both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of our operating expenses, as our fleet ages and the E-175 warranties expire. In addition, because our current aircraft were acquired over a relatively short period of time, significant maintenance events scheduled for these aircraft will occur at roughly the same intervals, meaning we will incur our most expensive scheduled maintenance obligations across our present fleet at approximately the same time. These more significant maintenance activities will result in out-of-service periods during which aircraft are dedicated to maintenance activities and unavailable for flying under our agreements. Any unexpected increase in our maintenance costs as our fleet ages or decreased revenues resulting from out-of-service periods could have an adverse effect on our cash flows, operating results, and financial condition.\nIf we face problems with any of our third-party service providers, our operations could be adversely affected.\nOur reliance upon others to provide essential services on behalf of our operations may limit our ability to control the efficiency and timeliness of contract services. We have entered into agreements with contractors to provide various facilities and services required for our operations, including aircraft maintenance, ground facilities and IT services, and expect to enter into additional similar agreements in the future. In particular, we rely on AAR and Aviall to provide fixed-rate parts procurement and component overhaul services for our aircraft fleet and GE to provide engine support. Our agreements with AAR, and other service providers, are subject to termination after notice. If our third-party service providers terminate their contracts with us, or do not provide timely or consistently high-quality service, we may not be able to replace them in a cost-efficient manner or in a manner timely enough to support our operational needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, our operations could be materially and adversely affected by the failure or inability of AAR, Aviall or GE to provide sufficient parts or related maintenance and support services to us in a timely manner.\nRegulatory changes or tariffs could negatively impact our business and financial condition.\nWe import a substantial portion of the equipment we utilize in our operations. For example, the sole manufacturers of our regional aircraft, MHI and Embraer, are headquartered in Japan and Brazil, respectively. We cannot predict the impact of potential regulatory changes or action by U.S. regulatory agencies, including the potential impact of tariffs or changes in international trade treaties on the cost and timing of parts and aircraft. Our business may be subject to additional costs as a result of potential regulatory changes, which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nThe issuance of operating restrictions applicable to one of the fleet types we operate could negatively impact our business and financial condition.\nWe rely on a limited number of aircraft types, including CRJ-700, CRJ-900, Boeing 737, and E-175 aircraft. The issuance of FAA or manufacturer directives restricting or prohibiting the use of the aircraft types we operate could negatively impact our business and financial results.\nIf we have a failure in our technology or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure our business and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nThe performance and reliability of our technology, and the technology of our major partners, are critical to our ability to compete effectively. Any internal technological error or failure or large-scale external interruption in the technological infrastructure we depend on, such as power, telecommunications, or the internet, may disrupt our internal network. Any individual, sustained or repeated failure of our technology or that of our major partners could impact our ability to conduct our business, lower the utilization of our aircraft and result in increased costs. Our technological systems and related data, and those of our major partners, may be vulnerable to a variety of sources of interruption due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers, and other security issues.\nIn addition, as a part of our ordinary business operations, we collect and store sensitive data, including personal information of our employees and information of our major partners. Our information systems are subject to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or information through fraud or other means of deception. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable, or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving, and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time. We may not be able to prevent all data security breaches or misuse of data. The compromise of our technology systems resulting in the loss, disclosure, misappropriation of, or access to, employees' or business partners' information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disruption to our operations and damage to our reputation, any or all of which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe are subject to various environmental and noise laws and regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to increasingly stringent federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations and ordinances relating to the protection of the environment and noise, including those relating to emissions to the air, discharges (including storm water discharges) to surface and subsurface waters, safe drinking water and the use, management, disposal and release of, and exposure to, hazardous substances, oils and waste materials. We are or may be subject to new or proposed laws and regulations that may have a direct effect (or indirect effect through our third-party specialists or airport facilities at which we operate) on our operations. In addition, U.S. airport authorities are exploring ways to limit de-icing fluid discharges. Any such existing, future, new or potential laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nSimilarly, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations that require us to investigate and remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain remediation standards. Under certain laws, generators of waste materials, and current and former owners or operators of facilities, can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at locations that have been identified as requiring response actions. Liability under these laws may be strict, joint and several, meaning that we could be liable for the costs of cleaning up environmental contamination regardless of fault or the amount of wastes directly attributable to us.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had aggregate federal and state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $591.4 million and $247.0 million, which expire in fiscal years 2027-2038 and 2022-2042, respectively. Approximately $180.9 million of our federal NOL carryforwards are not subject to expiration. Our unused losses generally carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire. We may be unable to use these losses to offset income before such unused losses expire. However, US federal net operating losses generated in fiscal years 2018 and forward are not subject to expiration and, if not utilized by fiscal 2023, are only available to offset eighty percent of taxable income each year due to changes in tax law attributable to the passage of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In addition, if a corporation undergoes an \"ownership change\" (generally defined as a greater than 50% cumulative change in the equity ownership of certain shareholders over a rolling three-year period) under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), the corporation's ability to use its pre- change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset future taxable income or taxes may be limited. We have experienced ownership changes in the past and may experience ownership changes as a result of future changes in our stock ownership (some of which changes may not be within our control). This, in turn, could materially reduce or eliminate our ability to use our losses or tax attributes to offset future taxable income or tax and have an adverse effect on our future cash flows.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy.\nOur growth strategy includes, among other things, providing regional flying to other airlines and/or entering into the cargo and express shipping business. We face numerous challenges in implementing our growth strategy, including our ability to:\n\u25aa\nprovide regional flying to other airlines with hub cities that overlap with our existing airline partners; and\n\u25aa\nenter into relationships with third parties to carry their cargo on terms that are acceptable to us.\nOur capacity purchase agreements limit our ability to provide regional flying services to other airlines in certain major airport hubs of American and United. These restrictions may make us a less attractive partner to other major airlines whose regional flying needs do not align with our geographical restrictions.\nThe potential benefits of entering the air cargo and express shipping sector will depend substantially on our ability to enter into additional relationships with integrated logistics companies and transition our existing business strategies into a new sector. We may be unsuccessful in entering into relationships with integrated logistics companies to carry cargo on terms that are acceptable to us. Additionally, our ability to transition our existing business strategies into a new sector may be costly, complex, and time-consuming, and our management will have to devote substantial time and resources to such effort. As we transition into this new sector, we may experience difficulties or delays in securing gate access and other airport services necessary to operate in the air cargo and express shipping sector. Our inability to successfully implement our growth strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and any assumptions underlying estimates of expected cost savings or expected revenues may be inaccurate.\nWe may not be able to make opportunistic acquisitions should we elect to do so as part of our growth strategy.\nIf we elect to pursue an acquisition, our ability to successfully implement this transaction would depend on a variety of factors, including the approval of our acquisition target's major partners, obtaining financing on acceptable terms and compliance with the restrictions contained in our debt agreements. If we need to obtain our lenders' consent prior to an acquisition, they may refuse to provide such consent or condition their consent on our compliance with additional restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility. Acquisition transactions involve risks, including those associated with integrating the operations or (as applicable) separately maintaining the operations, financial reporting, disparate technologies and personnel of acquired companies; managing geographically dispersed operations; the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; unknown risks; and the potential loss of key employees. We may not successfully integrate any businesses we may acquire in the future and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits relating to any such transactions. Strategic transactions may be expensive, time consuming and may strain our resources. Strategic transactions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of, among other things, the incurrence of debt, one-time write-offs of goodwill and amortization expenses of other intangible assets. In addition, strategic transactions that we may pursue could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities.\nOur ability to obtain financing or access capital markets may be limited.\nThere are a number of factors that may limit our ability to raise financing or access capital markets in the future, including our significant debt and future contractual obligations, our liquidity and credit status, our operating cash flows, the market conditions in the airline industry, U.S. and global economic conditions, the general state of the capital markets and the financial position of the major providers of commercial aircraft financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to source external financing for future aircraft acquisitions or for other significant capital needs, and if we are unable to source financing on acceptable terms, or unable to source financing at all, our business could be materially adversely affected. To the extent we finance our activities with additional debt, we may become subject to additional financial and other covenants that may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategy or otherwise constrain our growth and operations.\nNegative publicity regarding our customer service could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business strategy includes the implementation of our major partners' brand and product in order to increase customer loyalty and drive future ticket sales. In addition, we also receive certain amounts under our United CPA upon the results of passenger satisfaction surveys. However, we may experience a high number of passenger complaints related to, among other things, our customer service. These complaints, together with delayed and cancelled flights, and other service issues, are reported to the public by the DOT. If we do not meet our major partners' expectations with respect to reliability and service, our and our major partners' brand and product could be negatively impacted, which could result in customers deciding not to fly with our major partners or with us. If we are unable to provide consistently high-quality customer service, it could have an adverse effect on our relationships with our major partners.\nRisks associated with our presence in international emerging markets, including political or economic instability, and failure to adequately comply with existing legal requirements, may materially adversely affect us.\nSome of our target growth markets include countries with less developed economies, legal systems, financial markets and business and political environments are vulnerable to economic and political disruptions, such as significant fluctuations in gross domestic product, interest and currency exchange rates, civil disturbances, government instability, nationalization and expropriation of private assets, trafficking and the imposition of taxes or other charges by governments. The occurrence of any of these events in markets served by us now or in the future and the resulting instability may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe emphasize compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and have implemented and continue to implement and refresh policies, procedures and certain ongoing training of our employees, third-party specialists and partners with regard to business ethics and key legal requirements; however, we cannot assure you that our employees, third-party specialists or partners will adhere to our code of ethics, other policies or other legal requirements. If we fail to enforce our policies and procedures properly or maintain adequate recordkeeping and internal accounting practices to record our transactions accurately, we may be subject to sanctions. In the event we believe or have reason to believe our employees, third-party specialists or partners have or may have violated applicable laws or regulations, we may incur investigation costs, potential penalties and other related costs which in turn may materially adversely affect our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nThe outbreak and global spread of COVID-19 beginning in our 2020 fiscal year resulted in a severe decline in demand for air travel, which has adversely impacted the business of our major partners, and in turn has had an adverse impact that has been material to our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity. The duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and similar public health threats that we may face in the future, could result in additional adverse effects on our business, operating results, financial condition, and liquidity.\nThe airline industry is highly competitive and has undergone a period of consolidation and transition leaving fewer potential major partners.\nThe airline industry is highly competitive. We compete primarily with other regional airlines, some of which are owned by or operated by major airlines. In certain instances, our competitors are larger than us and possess significantly greater financial and other resources than we do. The airline industry has undergone substantial consolidation, including the mergers between Alaska Airlines and Virgin America Inc. in 2016, American and US Airways in 2013, Southwest Airlines Co. and AirTran Airways in 2011, United and Continental Airlines in 2010 and Delta and Northwest Airlines in 2008. Any additional consolidation or significant alliance activity within the airline industry could further limit the number of potential partners with whom we could enter into capacity purchase agreements.\nWe are subject to significant governmental regulation.\nAll interstate air carriers, including us, are subject to regulation by the DOT, the FAA and other governmental agencies, as described in Item 1. Government Regulation. We cannot predict whether we will be able to comply with all present and future laws, rules, regulations, and certification requirements or that the cost of continued compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our operations. We incur substantial costs in maintaining our current certifications and otherwise complying with the laws, rules, and regulations to which we are subject. A decision by the FAA to ground, or require time consuming inspections of or maintenance on, all or any of our aircraft for any reason may have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition to state and federal regulation, airports and municipalities enact rules and regulations that affect our operations and require that we incur substantial on-going costs.\nAirlines are often affected by factors beyond their control, including: air traffic congestion at airports; air traffic control inefficiencies; adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes or blizzards; increased security measures; new travel-related taxes; or the outbreak of disease; any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nLike other airlines, our business is affected by factors beyond our control, including air traffic congestion at airports, air traffic control inefficiencies, increased security measures, new travel-related taxes and fees, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, and the outbreak of disease. Factors that cause flight delays frustrate passengers and increase operating costs and decrease revenues, which in turn could adversely affect profitability. The federal government singularly controls all U.S. airspace, and airlines are completely dependent on the FAA to operate that airspace in a safe, efficient, and affordable manner. The air traffic control system, which is operated by the FAA, faces challenges in managing the growing demand for U.S. air travel. U.S. and foreign air-traffic controllers often rely on outdated technologies that routinely overwhelm the system and compel airlines to fly inefficient, indirect routes resulting in delays. In addition, there are currently proposals before Congress that could potentially lead to the privatization of the United States' air traffic control system, which could adversely affect our business. Further, implementation of the Next Generation Air Transport System by the FAA would result in changes to aircraft routings and flight paths that could lead to increased noise complaints and lawsuits, resulting in increased costs. There are additional proposals before Congress that would treat a wide range of consumer protection issues, including, among other things, proposals to regulate seat size, which could increase the costs of doing business.\nAdverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, winter snowstorms, or earthquakes, can cause flight cancellations or significant delays. Cancellations or delays due to adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, air traffic control problems or inefficiencies, breaches in security or other factors may affect us to a greater degree than other, larger airlines that may be able to recover more quickly from these events, and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition to a greater degree than other air carriers. Any general reduction in airline passenger traffic could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nTerrorist activities or warnings have dramatically impacted the airline industry and will likely continue to do so.\nThe terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and their aftermath have negatively impacted the airline industry in general, including our operations. If additional terrorist attacks are launched against the airline industry, there will be lasting consequences of the attacks, which may include loss of life, property damage, increased security and insurance costs, increased concerns about future terrorist attacks, increased government regulation and airport delays due to heightened security. We cannot provide any assurance that these events will not harm the airline industry generally or our operations or financial condition in particular.\nThe occurrence of an aviation accident involving our aircraft would negatively impact our operations and financial condition.\nAn accident or incident involving our aircraft could result in significant potential claims of injured passengers and others, as well as repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequential temporary or permanent loss from service. In the event of an accident, our liability insurance may not be adequate to offset our exposure to potential claims and we may be forced to bear substantial losses from the accident. Substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance coverage would harm our operational and financial results. Moreover, any aircraft accident or incident, even if fully insured, could cause a public perception that our operations are less safe or reliable than other airlines.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of an investment in our stock to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: (i) announcements concerning our major partners, competitors, the airline industry, or the economy in general; (ii) strategic actions by us, our major partners, or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings; (iii) media reports and publications about the safety of our aircraft or the types of aircraft we operate; (iv) new regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines; (v) announcements concerning the availability of the types of aircraft we use; (vi) significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of companies in the airline industry; (vii) changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts or failure to meet analysts' performance expectations; (viii) sales of our common stock or other actions by insiders or investors with significant shareholdings, including sales by our principal shareholders; and (ix) general market, political and other economic conditions.\nThe stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In the past, shareholders have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. Any similar litigation against us could result in substantial costs, divert management's attention and resources, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or publish negative reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities and industry analysts may publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the trading price of our common stock would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which may cause the trading price of our common stock and the trading volume of our common stock to decline.\nThe value of our common stock may be materially adversely affected by additional issuances of common stock underlying our outstanding warrants.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of 4,899,497 shares of our common stock, all of which were issued to the U.S. Treasury pursuant to the terms of the Loan and Guarantee Agreement dated October 30, 2020. The warrants have a term of five (5) years from the date of issuance and an initial exercise price of $3.98 per share. Any future warrant exercises by the U.S. Treasury, or any authorized transferee of the U.S. Treasury, will be dilutive to our existing common shareholders. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public or private market, a perception in the market that such sales could occur, or the issuance of securities exercisable into our common stock, could adversely affect the prevailing price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our charter documents might deter acquisition bids for us, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOur second amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that, among other things:\n\u25aa\nauthorize our Board of Directors, without shareholder approval, to designate and fix the voting powers, designations, preferences, limitations, restrictions, and relative rights of one or more series of preferred stock so designated, or right to acquire such preferred stock;\n\u25aa\ndilute the interest of, or impair the voting power of, holders of our common stock and could also have the effect of discouraging, delaying, or preventing a change of control;\n\u25aa\nestablish advance notice procedures that shareholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our Board of Directors and propose matters to be brought before an annual or special meeting of our shareholders, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company;\n\u25aa\nauthorize a majority of our Board of Directors to appoint a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our Board of Directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which may prevent shareholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors;\n\u25aa\nrestrict the number of directors constituting our Board of Directors to within a set range, and give our Board of Directors exclusive authority to increase or decrease the number of directors within such range, which may prevent shareholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors; and\n\u25aa\nrestrict the ability of shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders.\nOur corporate charter includes provisions limiting ownership by non-U.S. citizens.\nTo comply with restrictions imposed by federal law on foreign ownership of U.S. airlines, our second amended and restated articles of incorporation restrict the ownership and voting of shares of our common stock by people and entities who are not \"citizens of the United States\" as that term is defined in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 40102(a). That statute defines \"citizen of the United States\" as, among other things, a U.S. corporation, of which the president and at least two-thirds of the board of directors and other managing officers are individuals who are citizens of the United States, which is under the actual control of citizens of the United States and in which at least 75% of the voting interest is owned or controlled by persons who are citizens of the United States. Our second amended and restated articles of incorporation prohibit any non-U.S. citizen from owning or controlling more than 24.9% of the aggregate votes of all outstanding shares of our common stock or 49.0% of the total number of outstanding shares of our capital stock. The restrictions imposed by the above-described ownership caps are applied to each non-U.S. citizen in reverse chronological order based on the date of registration on our foreign stock record. At no time may shares of our capital stock held by non-U.S. citizens be voted unless such shares are reflected on the foreign stock record. The voting rights of non-U.S. citizens having voting control over any shares of our capital stock are subject to automatic suspension to the extent required to ensure that we are in compliance with applicable law. In the event any transfer or issuance of shares of our capital stock to a non-U.S. citizen would result in non-U.S. citizens owning more than the above-described cap amounts, such transfer or issuance will be void and of no effect.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had outstanding warrants to purchase 4,899,497 shares of our common stock, all of which were held by the U.S. Treasury. We are currently in compliance with all applicable foreign ownership restrictions.\nOur corporate charter limits certain transfers of our stock, which limits are intended to preserve our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards, and these limits could have an effect on the market price and liquidity of our common stock.\nTo reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes, our second amended and restated articles of incorporation prohibit the transfer of any shares of our capital stock that would result in (i) any person or entity owning 4.75% or more of our then-outstanding capital stock, or (ii) an increase in the percentage ownership of any person or entity owning 4.75% or more of our then-outstanding capital stock. These transfer restrictions expire upon the earliest of (i) the repeal of Section 382 of the Code or any successor statute if our Board of Directors determines that such restrictions are no longer necessary to preserve our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards, (ii) the beginning of a fiscal year to which our Board of Directors determines that no net operating losses may be carried forward, or (iii) such other date as determined by our Board of Directors. These transfer restrictions apply to the beneficial owner of the shares of our capital stock. The clients of an investment advisor are treated as the beneficial owners of stock for this purpose if the clients have the right to receive dividends, if any, the power to acquire or dispose of the shares of our capital stock, and the right to proceeds from the sale of our capital stock. Certain transactions approved by our Board of Directors, such as mergers and consolidations meeting certain requirements set forth in our articles of incorporation, are exempt from the above-described transfer restrictions. Our Board of Directors also has the ability to grant waivers, in its discretion, with respect to transfers of our stock that would otherwise be prohibited.\nThe transfer restrictions contained in our second amended and restated articles of incorporation may impair or prevent a sale of common stock by a shareholder and may adversely affect the price at which a shareholder can sell our common stock. In addition, this limitation may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company, creating a perception that a change in control cannot occur or otherwise discouraging takeover attempts that some shareholders may consider beneficial, which could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We cannot predict the effect that this provision in our second amended and restated articles of incorporation may have on the market price of our common stock.\nWe currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our common stock appreciates.\nWe have not historically paid dividends on shares of our common stock and do not expect to pay dividends on such shares in the foreseeable future. Additionally, certain of our aircraft lease facilities and our loan with the U.S. Treasury contain restrictions that limit our ability to or prohibit us from paying dividends to holders of our common stock. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, restrictions contained in current or future leases and financing instruments, business prospects and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant, including restrictions under applicable law. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a positive return on your investment in us will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe are an \"emerging growth company,\" and the reduced disclosure and regulatory requirements applicable to \"emerging growth companies\" may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe qualify as an \"emerging growth company\" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \"JOBS Act\"), and therefore we may take advantage of reduced disclosure and regulatory requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. As an emerging growth company:\n\u25aa\nwe are not required to obtain an attestation and report from our independent registered public accounting firm on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u25aa\nwe may present reduced disclosure regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and\n\u25aa\nwe are not required to hold nonbinding advisory shareholder votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.\nWe may take advantage of these reduced requirements until we are no longer an \"emerging growth company,\" which will occur upon the earliest of (i) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our IPO (i.e. September 30, 2023), (ii) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenue is $1.07 billion or more, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous rolling three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities and (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a \"large accelerated filer\" as defined in the Exchange Act. Investors may find our common stock less attractive or our company less comparable to certain other public companies because we will rely on these reduced requirements.\nIn addition, the JOBS Act permits an \"emerging growth company\" to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards. This effectively permits the delayed adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we have elected to \"opt out\" of such extended transition period and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the dates for which compliance is required for non-emerging growth companies. This election is irrevocable.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, increase our operating costs, divert management's attention, and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members or executive officers.\nWe became a public company in August 2018. As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We also have incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and related rules implemented or to be implemented by the SEC and the Nasdaq Global Select Market. The expenses incurred by public companies generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly and divert management's time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. It could also make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees, or as our executive officers and may divert managements attention. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.\nWe are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis, and any future adverse findings from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports, result in significant expenses to remediate any internal control deficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 and each subsequent year. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC following the later of the date we are deemed to be an \"accelerated filer\" or a \"large accelerated filer,\" each as defined in the Exchange Act, or the date we are no longer an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the JOBS Act. We are required to disclose, to the extent material, changes made in our internal control over financial reporting on a quarterly basis.\nTo comply with the requirements of being a public company, we may need to undertake various actions, such as implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring accounting or internal audit staff. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at September 30, 2022. In making these assessments, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessments and those criteria, management determined that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022. See ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nIn future periods, if we fail to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment, it could result in material misstatements in our financial statements and failure to meet our reporting obligations, which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and adversely impact our stock price. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nFlight Equipment\nAs of September 30, 2022, our aircraft fleet consisted of the following:\nAverage\nPassenger\nFlight\nCruising\nAverage\nAircraft Type\nOwned\nLeased\nTotal\nCapacity\nRange (miles)\nSpeed (mph)\nAge (years)\nE-175 Regional Jet\n70-76\n2,100\n6.9\nCRJ-900 Regional Jet\n76-79\n1,500\n16.0\nCRJ-700 Regional Jet\n50-70\n1,600\n17.5\nCRJ-200 Regional Jet\n-\n1,500\n28.7\nBoeing 737 Cargo Jet\n-\n2,600\n29.0\nTotal\nSeveral factors impact our fleet size, including contract expirations, lease expirations, growth opportunities and opportunities to transition to an alternative airline partner. Below is a summary of our fleet by aircraft type. Our actual future fleet size and mix of aircraft types will likely vary, and may vary materially, from our current fleet size.\n\u25aa\nE-175s - As of September 30, 2022, we operated 60 E-175 and 20 E-175LL aircraft under our United CPA. As part of our amended and restated United CPA, we agreed to extend the term of 42 of our E-175 aircraft (owned by United) for an additional five (5) years which will now expire between 2024 and 2028, subject to United's early termination rights. United also has the right to extend the term of these aircraft for four (4) additional three-year increments. In addition, 18 of the E-175 aircraft (owned by us) operating under our United CPA expire between January 2028 and November 2028, subject to United's early termination rights. In the current period, we added 20 E-175LL aircraft under the United CPA with a term of 12 years. Our United CPA permits United, subject to certain conditions, including the payment of certain costs tied to aircraft type, to terminate the United CPA in its discretion, or remove aircraft from service, by giving us 90 days notice.\n\u25aa\nCRJ-900s - As of September 30, 2022, we operated 42 CRJ-900 aircraft under our American CPA and 11 CRJ-900 aircraft as operational spares. Our American CPA will expire in 2025 unless otherwise extended or amended. Our American CPA is subject to termination prior to that date, subject to our right to cure, in various circumstances. Eleven (11) of these CRJ-900 aircraft have been classified as held for sale during fiscal year 2022.\n\u25aa\nCRJ-700s - As of September 30, 2022, our fleet included 10 CRJ-700 aircraft. Eight (8) of these CRJ-700 aircraft are classified as assets held for sale, and the remaining two (2) aircraft were leased to a third party.\n\u25aa\nCRJ-200s - As of September 30, 2022, our fleet included one (1) CRJ-200 aircraft that has been classified as held for sale during fiscal year 2022.\n\u25aa\nBoeing 737 Cargo Jets - As of September 30, 2022, we leased one (1) Boeing 737 aircraft from a third party and subleased two Boeing 737 aircraft from DHL under our DHL FSA. The DHL FSA expires five (5) years from the commencement date of the first aircraft placed into service. The first revenue generating flight took place in October 2020.\nFacilities\nIn addition to aircraft, we have office and maintenance facilities to support our operations. Each of our facilities are summarized in the following table:\nType\nLocation\nOwnership\nApproximate\nSquare Feet\nCorporate Headquarters\nPhoenix, Arizona\nLeased\n33,770\nTraining Center\nPhoenix, Arizona\nLeased\n23,783\nParts/Stores\nPhoenix, Arizona\nLeased\n12,000\nHangar\nPhoenix, Arizona\nLeased\n22,467\nOffice, Hangar and Warehouse\nEl Paso, Texas\nLeased\n31,292\nOffice, Hangar\nDallas, Texas\nLeased\n30,440\nParts Storage\nDallas, Texas\nLeased\n8,143\nHangar\nHouston, Texas\nLeased\n74,524\nHangar\nLouisville, Kentucky\nLeased\n26,762\nHangar\nDulles, Washington\nLeased\n28,451\nWarehouse\nTucson, Arizona\nLeased\n10,590\nWarehouse, Office\nErlanger, Kentucky\nLeased\n6,025\nWe believe our facilities are suitable and adequate for our current and anticipated needs. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nWe are subject to two (2) putative class action lawsuits alleging federal securities law violations in connection with our IPO, one (1) in the Superior Court of the State of Arizona and one (1) in U.S. District Court of Arizona. These purported class actions were filed in March and April 2020 against the Company, certain current and former officers and directors, and certain underwriters of the Companys IPO. The state and federal lawsuits each make the same or similar allegations of violations of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for allegedly making materially false and misleading statements in, or omitting material information from, our IPO registration statement.\nOn March 2, 2022, the parties in the federal lawsuit attended a mediation and reached an agreement in principle to settle all claims asserted in that action for the sum of $5 million, which will be paid by the Companys directors and officers insurance carriers. The settlement is subject to preliminary and final approval by the federal court. The motion for preliminary approval was filed on May 6, 2022, and no objections to the settlement were filed by the deadline for such objections. The parties are waiting for the Court to schedule a date for the preliminary approval hearing. If preliminary and final approval is obtained, the claims of all putative class members, whether asserted in the federal or state actions, will be extinguished, unless and only to the extent that a particular class member takes affirmative steps to have its claims excluded.\nIn addition, we are subject to certain legal actions which we consider routine to our business activities. As of September 30, 2022, our management believed that the ultimate outcome of the two (2) putative class action lawsuits and such other routine legal matters are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nPART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nMarket Information\nOur common stock has traded on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \"MESA\" since August 10, 2018. Prior to that date, there was no public market for our common stock.\nHolders of Record\nAs of November 11, 2022, there were approximately 75 holders of record of our common stock. Because many of our shares of common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, as a result, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders.\nThe transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is ComputerShare Trust Company, N.A.\nDividends\nWe have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors, subject to applicable laws, and will depend on our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, general business conditions, and other factors that our Board of Directors considers relevant.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans\nThe information required by this item with respect to our equity compensation plans is incorporated by reference to our definitive proxy statement for our 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (\"2023 Proxy Statement\") to be filed with the SEC within 120 days of our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.\nStock Performance Graph\nThe following Performance Graph and related information shall not be deemed \"soliciting material\" or \"filed\" with the SEC, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, except to the extent we specifically incorporate it by reference into such filing.\nThe following graph compares the cumulative total return on our common stock with that of the Nasdaq Stock Market (U.S. Companies) and the Nasdaq Stock Market Transportation Index. The period shown commences on August 10, 2018, and ends on September 30, 2022, the end of our fiscal year. The graph assumes an investment of $100.00 in each of the above on the close of market on August 10, 2018. The stock performance shown on the graph below represents historical stock performance and is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance.\nThis performance graph is not deemed to be incorporated by reference into any of our other filings under the Exchange Act, or the Securities Act, except to the extent we specifically incorporate it by reference into such filings.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nNone.\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2022, the Company repurchased a total of 14,957 shares of its common stock for $0.1 million to cover the income tax obligation on vested employee equity awards. The Company repurchased a total of 147,108 shares of its common stock for $0.5 million to cover the income tax obligation on vested employee equity awards during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. ITEM 6. [RESERVED] ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements, the accompanying notes, and the other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties such as our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements below. Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences in our actual results include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and those discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in the sections \"Cautionary Notes Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" and Part I, Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" above.\nOverview\nMesa Airlines is a regional air carrier providing scheduled passenger service to 107 cities in 39 states, the District of Columbia, the Bahamas, and Mexico, as well as cargo services out of Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. All of our flights are operated as either American Eagle, United Express, or DHL Express flights pursuant to the terms of capacity purchase agreements (\u2018CPA) with American and United and a flight services agreement (FSA) with DHL. We have a significant presence in several of our major partners' key domestic hubs and focus cities, including Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, and Washington-Dulles.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we operated under the CPAs and FSA, or maintained as operational spares, a fleet of 158 aircraft with approximately 306 daily departures. During 2022, we committed to a formal plan to sell certain of our CRJ-900 and CRJ-200 aircraft. We classified 11 CRJ-900 and one (1) CRJ-200 aircraft as assets held for sale as of September 30, 2022. We also leased 20 CRJ-700 aircraft to a third party for majority of the fiscal year. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we committed to a formal plan to sell 18 of the 20 CRJ-700 aircraft and terminated the leases on these 18 aircraft. We completed the sale of 10 CRJ-700 aircraft and eight (8) remained as assets held for sale as of September 30, 2022. We operate 42 CRJ-900 aircraft under our American CPA; 20 E-175LL and 60 E-175 aircraft under our United CPA. We operate three (3) Boeing 737-400F aircraft under the DHL FSA. For our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, approximately 34% of our aircraft in scheduled service were operated for American, 64% were operated for United, and 2% were operated for DHL. All our operating revenue in our 2022 and 2021 fiscal years were derived from operations associated with our American and United CPAs, DHL FSA, and from leases of aircraft to a third party. All our operating revenue in our 2020 fiscal year was derived from operations associated with our American and United CPAs.\nOur long-term agreements provide us guaranteed monthly revenue for each aircraft under contract, a fixed fee for each block hour and flight actually flown, and reimbursement of certain direct operating expenses in exchange for providing regional flying on behalf of our major partners. Our capacity purchase and flight services agreements also shelter us from many of the elements that cause volatility in airline financial performance, including fuel prices, variations in ticket prices, and fluctuations in number of passengers. In providing regional flying under our capacity purchase agreements, and cargo flight services under our flight services agreement, we use the logos, service marks, flight crew uniforms and aircraft paint schemes of our major partners. Our major partners control route selection, pricing, seat inventories, marketing, and scheduling, and provide us with ground support services, airport landing slots and gate access.\nUnder our DHL FSA, we receive a fee per block hour with a minimum block hour guarantee in exchange for providing cargo services. Ground support including fueling and airport fees are paid directly by DHL.\n2022 Financial Highlights\nFor our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we had total operating revenues of $531.0 million, a 5.4% increase, compared to $503.6 million for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. Net loss for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 was $182.7 million, or $(5.06) per diluted share, compared to net income of $16.6 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021.\nDuring our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, our completed block hours decreased by 51,708, or 16.0%, compared to our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021.\nIndustry Trends\nWe believe our operating and business performance is driven by various factors that typically affect regional airlines and their markets, including trends which affect the broader airline and travel industries, though our capacity purchase and flight services agreements reduce our exposure to fluctuations in certain trends. The following key factors may materially affect our future performance.\nAvailability and Training of Qualified Pilots. On July 8, 2013, as directed by the U.S. Congress, the FAA issued more stringent pilot qualification and crew member flight training standards, which, among other things, increased the required training time for new airline pilots from 250 hours to 1,500 hours of flight time. With these changes, the supply of qualified pilot candidates eligible for hiring by the airline industry has been dramatically reduced. To address the diminished supply of qualified pilot candidates, regional airlines implemented significant pilot wage and bonus increases.\nIn more recent periods, our pilots continue to be recruited by other carriers, primarily the major carriers and heavy equipment cargo operators, which generally offer higher salaries and more extensive benefit programs. The magnitude of this attrition in fiscal 2022 created significant backlogs in training, further exacerbating an already challenging environment. These events have had, and continue to have a negative impact on pilot scheduling, work hours, and the number of pilots required to support our operations.\nIn August 2022, we entered into a Letter of Agreement with the Airline Pilots Association (ALPA), which provided for increased overall hourly pay increases of nearly 118% for captains and 172% for new-hire first officers. While we remain engaged in negotiations with ALPA over other areas of our collective bargaining agreement with ALPA, we believe these pay increases will positively impact our ability to attract, hire, and retain pilots in future periods.\nTo further address the diminished supply of qualified pilots, we recently launched the Mesa Pilot Development Program (MPD). As part of this program, on September 22, 2022, we purchased 29 Pipistrel Alpha Trainer 2 aircrafts, with the option to buy an additional 75 over the next year. This new fleet will be the backbone of the MPD program, with pilots being provided with the opportunity to accumulate up to 1,500 flight hours required to fly a commercial aircraft at Mesa Airlines. Flight costs of $25 per hour, per pilot, will be fully financed by us with zero interest, providing no upfront out-of-pocket expense for flight time while the candidate is accruing the required hours to earn their Airline Transport Pilot (ATP) certificate. As part of candidates commitment to flying for Mesa Airlines, flight costs will be repaid over three (3) years during the term of their employment.\nNo assurance can be given that the measures we are currently taking or may take in the future will enable us to attract, hire and train pilots at a rate necessary to support our operations.\nPilot and Mechanic Attrition. In recent years, we have experienced significant volatility in our attrition as a result of pilot wage and bonus increases at other regional air carriers, the growth of cargo, low-cost and ultra-low-cost carriers, and the number of pilots at major airlines reaching the statutory mandatory retirement age of 65 years. If our actual pilot attrition rates are materially different than our projections, our operations and financial results could be materially and adversely affected. Although we target maintenance staffing levels above our projected needs in order to account for attrition, which is widespread in the industry, from time to time we have experienced attrition with our maintenance technicians, who have the option to seek employment at mainline airlines, which generally offer higher salaries and more extensive benefit programs than regional airlines are financially able to offer. Attrition of maintenance technicians has sometimes required us to supplement our staff with qualified temporary employees.\nAs discussed generally above, we have announced a new pay structure whereby starting September 15, 2022, we will offer starting wages of $100 an hour for entry-level first officers, and $150 an hour for first-year captains while captains with 20 years of experience will be paid $215 an hour to remain competitive and attract and retain experienced, qualified pilots.\nEconomic Conditions, Challenges and Risks\nMarket Volatility. The airline industry is volatile and affected by economic cycles and trends. Consumer confidence and discretionary spending, spread of a virus, fear of terrorism or war, weakening economic conditions, fare initiatives, fluctuations in fuel prices, labor actions, changes in governmental regulations on taxes and fees, weather and other factors have contributed to a number of reorganizations, bankruptcies, liquidations, and business combinations among major and regional airlines. The effect of economic cycles and trends may be somewhat mitigated by our reliance on capacity purchase agreements. If, however, any of our major partners experiences a prolonged decline in the number of passengers or is negatively affected by low ticket prices or high fuel prices, it may seek rate reductions in future capacity purchase agreements, or materially reduce our scheduled flights in order to reduce its costs. Our financial performance could be negatively impacted by any adverse changes to the rates, number of aircraft or utilization under our capacity purchase agreements.\nLabor. The airline industry is heavily unionized. The wages, benefits and work rules of unionized airline industry employees are determined by collective bargaining agreements. As of September 30, 2022, approximately 66.9% of our workforce was represented by the ALPA and AFA. In August 2022, we entered into a three-year Letter of Agreement with ALPA, which provided for increased overall hourly pay increases of nearly 118% for captains and 172% for new-hire first officers. While we remain engaged in negotiations with ALPA over other areas of our collective bargaining agreement with ALPA, we believe these pay increases will positively impact our ability to attract, hire, and retain pilots in future periods. In September 2022, we entered into a Letter of Agreement with AFA to extend the term of our agreement by two years. Our extension with AFA provided, among other things, an increase in compensation for our flight attendants. The terms and conditions of our future collective bargaining agreements may be affected by the results of collective bargaining negotiations at other airlines that may have a greater ability, due to larger scale, greater efficiency or other factors, to bear higher costs than we can. In addition, conflicts between airlines and their unions can lead to work slowdowns or stoppages. A strike or other significant labor dispute with our unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct business.\nImpact of Pilot Shortage. During our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the severity of the pilot shortage, elevated pilot attrition, and increasing costs associated with pilot wages adversely impacted our financial results, cash flows, financial position, and other key financial ratios. One of the primary factors contributing to the pilot shortage and attrition is the demand for pilots at major carriers, which are hiring at an accelerated rate to backfill the thousands of pilots whom they offered early retirements to at the beginning of the pandemic. These airlines now seek to increase their capacity to meet the growing demand for air travel as the global pandemic has moderated. A primary source of pilots for the major US passenger and cargo carriers are the US regional airlines.\nAs a result of pilot shortage and attrition, we produced less block hours to generate revenues and incurred penalties for operational shortfalls under our CPAs. These challenges resulted in a negative impact on the Companys financial results highlighted by operating cash flows of $13.4 million and net loss of $182.7 million including a non-cash impairment charge related to the Companys American asset group of $171.8 million. These conditions and events raised financial concerns about our ability to continue to fund our operations and meet debt obligation in the next twelve months\nTo address the events that gave rise to such concerns, management developed and implemented the following material changes to its business designed to ensure the Company could continue to fund its operations and meet its debt obligations over the next 12 months. In addition to successfully implementing these effective measures, the Company expects to develop and implement additional measures aimed at addressing periods beyond the next 12 months\n\u25aa\nIn the fourth quarter, the Company reached an agreement with ALPA which increased overall pilot hourly pay by nearly 118% for captains and 172% for new-hire first officers. As a result of this agreement, we have experienced reduced attrition rates and attracted new pilots.\n\u25aa\nThe Company and American have agreed to terminate and complete a wind-down of the American CPA. This will ultimately eliminate financial penalties incurred under the American CPA. In December 2022, we entered into Amendment No.11 to our American CPA. See the disclosure under Note 18 - \"Subsequent Events\" in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of Amendment No. 11 which includes among other things, disclosure regarding the wind-down of our operations with American and the termination of the American CPA.\n\u25aa\nIn December 2022, we entered into the Third Amended and Restated Capacity Purchase Agreement with United which amended and restated the existing United CPA. This agreement increases block hour revenues to cover increased wages agreed to with ALPA and adds CRJ 900 aircraft currently operating under the American CPA. See the disclosure under Note 18 - \"Subsequent Events\" in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statement included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the Amended and Restated United CPA which includes among others, disclosure regarding the transition of the aircraft operated under the American CPA to be operated under the Third Amended and Restated United CPA.\n\u25aa\nWe entered into an agreement with United to sell 18 CRJ-700 aircraft during the reporting period, of which 10 were sold. The approximate net proceeds from the sale in the quarter was $ 36.8 million after retirement of debt. The remaining eight (8) are expected to close in early January 2022. The approximate net proceeds from the sale and after retirement of debt is $8 million.\n\u25aa\nWe entered into an agreement with a third party to sell eleven (11) of our CRJ-900 aircraft and one CRJ-200 aircraft to raise capital and retire debt. The approximate net proceeds from the sale are expected to be $8.2 million after retirement of debt.\n\u25aa\nWe have entered into an agreement to sell 30 spare engines to United to raise capital and retire debt. The approximate gross proceeds from the sale is expected to be $80 million and will retire debt of $26.4 million.\n\u25aa\nWe established a new line of credit totaling $25.5 million to draw upon when needed. See the disclosure under Note 18 - \"subsequent Events\" in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the line of credit and amount drawn upon subsequently.\n\u25aa\nWe entered into an agreement with Export Development Bank of Canada (EDC), reducing debt and interest payments on all seven aircraft for the period of January 2023 through December 2024, providing up to $14 million of liquidity. Additionally, the junior noteholder MHIRJ agreed to reduce its loan amount by approximately $5 million.\n\u25aa\nWe entered into an agreement with RASPRO Trust, reducing the buyout pricing on all 15 aircraft at lease termination by a total of $25 million.\n\u25aa\nWe established the Mesa Pilot Development Program (the \"MPD Program\") to increase the pilot supply to Mesa.. We have entered into an agreement to purchase up to 29 state-of-the-art Pipistrel Alpha Trainer 2 aircraft. This new fleet will be the backbone of our MPD Program to help commercial pilots accelerate their accumulation of flight hours to reach the minimum flight hours required by FAA and then be hired by Mesa. As part of the program, pilots will be provided with the opportunity to accumulate up to 1,500 flight hours required to fly a commercial aircraft at Mesa Airlines. Flights costs of $25 per hour, per pilot, will be fully financed by us with zero interest, providing no upfront out-of-pocket expense for flight time while the candidate is accruing the required hours to earn their ATP certificate.\n\u25aa\nWe added flight training simulators and flight training instructors to expand our training capacity to backfill pilots lost to attrition.\n\u25aa\nWe have expanded the United Aviate program participation to include all pilots flying for Mesa. Previously, pilots had to fly under the United Express contract for a minimum of two (2) years to qualify for the flow through to United Airlines. Now, all pilots regardless of contract, are eligible to flow through to United Airlines enhancing Mesa's ability to attract and retain pilots.\n\u25aa\nWe have delayed and/or deferred major spending on aircraft and engine maintenance to match the current and projected level of flight activity.\nThese plans and initiatives outlined above have effectively alleviated pressure on financial performance. While we continue implement and monitor our plans and initiatives, there is no guarantee that these will continue to be effective and achieve their desired objectives.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company has $97.2 million of short-term debt due within the next twelve months. We plan to meet these obligations with our cash on hand, ongoing cashflows from our operations, as well as the liquidity we have achieved as outlined above.\nCompetition. The airline industry is highly competitive. We compete principally with other regional airlines. Major airlines typically award capacity purchase agreements to regional airlines based on the following criteria: ability to fly contracted schedules, availability of labor resources including pilots, low operating cost, financial resources, geographical infrastructure, overall customer service levels relating to on-time arrival and flight completion percentages, and the overall image of the regional airline. Our ability to renew our existing agreements and earn additional flying opportunities in the future will depend, in significant part, on our ability to maintain a low-cost structure competitive with other regional air carriers.\nMaintenance Contracts, Costs and Timing. Our employees perform routine airframe and engine maintenance along with periodic inspections of equipment at their respective maintenance facilities. We also use third-party vendors, such as AAR, Aviall, MHI, GE, and StandardAero, for certain heavy airframe and engine maintenance work, along with parts procurement and component overhaul services for our aircraft fleet. As of September 30, 2022, $ 50.6 million of parts inventory was consigned to us by AAR and Aviall under long-term contracts that is not reflected in our consolidated balance sheet.\nThe average age of our E-175, CRJ-900, Boeing 737, and CRJ-700 type aircraft is approximately 6.9, 16.0, 29.0, and 17.5 years, respectively. Due to the relatively young age of our E-175 aircraft, they require less maintenance now than they will in the future. In prior periods, we incurred relatively low maintenance expenses on our E-175 aircraft because most of the parts are under multi-year warranties and a limited number of heavy airframe checks and engine overhauls have occurred. As our E-175 aircraft age and these warranties expire, we expect that maintenance costs will increase in absolute terms and as a percentage of revenue. In addition, because our current aircraft were acquired over a relatively short period of time, significant maintenance events scheduled for these aircraft will occur at roughly the same intervals, meaning we will incur our most expensive scheduled maintenance obligations across our present fleet at approximately the same time. These more significant maintenance activities result in out-of-service periods during which aircraft are dedicated to maintenance activities and unavailable for flying under our capacity purchase agreements.\nWe use the direct expense method of accounting for our maintenance of regional jet engine overhauls, airframe, auxiliary power units and landing gear for the majority of our fleets, with the exception of Mesa-owned E-175 aircraft. Heavy maintenance and major overhaul costs on our owned E-175 fleet are deferred and amortized until the earlier of the end of the useful life of the related asset or the next scheduled heavy maintenance event. Normal recurring maintenance is expensed when the maintenance work is completed, or over the repair period, if materially different. Our maintenance policy is determined by fleet when major maintenance is incurred. While we keep a record of expected maintenance events, the actual timing and costs of major engine maintenance expense are subject to variables such as estimated usage, government regulations and the level of unscheduled maintenance events and their actual costs. Accordingly, we cannot reliably quantify the costs or timing of future maintenance-related expenses for any significant period of time.\nAircraft Leasing and Finance Determinations. We have generally funded aircraft acquisitions through a combination of operating leases and debt financing. Our determination to lease or finance the acquisition of aircraft may be influenced by a variety of factors, including the preferences of our major partners, the strength of our balance sheet and credit profile and those of our major partners, the length and terms of the available lease or financing alternatives, the applicable interest rates, and any lease return conditions. When possible, we prefer to finance aircraft through debt rather than operating leases, due to lower operating costs, extended depreciation period, opportunity for aircraft equity, absence of lease return conditions and greater flexibility in renewing the aircraft under our capacity purchase agreements with our major partners after paying off the principal balance.\nSubsequent to the initial acquisition of an aircraft, we may also refinance the aircraft or convert one form of financing to another (e.g., replacing an aircraft lease with debt financing). The purchase of leased aircraft allows us to lower our operating costs and avoid lease-related use restrictions and return conditions.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had 82 aircraft in our fleet under lease, including 62 E-175 aircraft owned by United and leased to us at nominal amounts and three (3) Boeing 737 cargo jets subleased to us by DHL at nominal amounts. In order to determine the proper classification of our leased aircraft as either operating leases or finance leases, we must make certain estimates at the inception of the lease relating to the economic useful life and the fair value of an asset as well as select an appropriate discount rate to be used in discounting future lease payments. These estimates are utilized by management in making computations as required by existing accounting standards that determine whether the lease is classified as an operating lease or a finance lease. All of our aircraft leases have been classified as operating leases, which results in rental payments being charged to expense over the terms of the related leases.\nWe are also subject to lease return provisions that require a minimum portion of eligible flight time for certain components remain when the aircraft is returned at the lease expiration. We estimate the cost of maintenance lease return obligations and accrue such costs over the remaining lease term when the expense is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nSee \"Risk Factors\" for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\nSeasonality\nOur results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year since the airline industry is subject to seasonal fluctuations and general economic conditions. Our operations are somewhat favorably affected by increased utilization of our aircraft in the summer months and are unfavorably affected by increased fleet maintenance and by inclement weather during the winter months.\nGlossary of Airline Terms\nSet forth below is a glossary of industry terms used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\n\"Available seat miles\" or \"ASMs\" means the number of seats available for passengers multiplied by the number of miles the seats are flown.\n\"Average stage length\" means the average number of statute miles flown per flight segment.\n\"Block hours\" means the number of hours during which the aircraft is in revenue service, measured from the time of gate departure before take-off until the time of gate arrival at the destination.\n\"CRASM\" means contract revenue divided by ASMs.\n\"DOT\" means the United States Department of Transportation.\n\"FAA\" means the United States Federal Aviation Administration.\n\"FTE\" means full-time equivalent employee.\n\"Load factor\" means the percentage of aircraft seat miles actually occupied on a flight (RPMs divided by ASMs).\n\"NMB\" means the National Mediation Board.\n\"Pass-through and other revenue\" means costs from our major partners under our agreements that we equally recognize as both a revenue and an expense, including passenger and hull insurance, aircraft property taxes, landing fees, catering and certain maintenance costs related to our E-175 aircraft.\n\"Revenue Passenger Miles\" or \"RPMs\" means the number of miles traveled by paying passengers.\n\"TSA\" means the United States Transportation Security Administration.\n\"Utilization\" means the percentage derived from dividing (i) the number of block hours actually flown during a given month under a particular capacity purchase agreement by (ii) the maximum number of block hours that could be flown during such month under the particular capacity purchase agreement.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nThe following discussion summarizes the key components of our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income.\nOperating Revenues\nOur consolidated operating revenues consist of contract revenue as well as pass-through and other revenue.\nContract Revenue. Contract revenue consists of the fixed monthly amounts per aircraft received pursuant to our capacity purchase agreements and flight services agreement with our major partners, along with the additional amounts received based on the number of flights and block hours flown, and rental revenue for aircraft leased to a third party. Contract revenues we receive from our major partners are paid on a weekly basis and recognized over time consistent with the delivery of service under our agreements.\nPass-Through and Other Revenue. Pass-through and other revenue consists of passenger and hull insurance, aircraft property taxes, landing fees, and other aircraft and traffic servicing costs received pursuant to our agreements with our major partners, as well as certain maintenance costs related to United owned E-175 aircraft.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of the following items:\nFlight Operations. Flight operations expense includes costs related to salaries, bonuses and benefits earned by our pilots, flight attendants, and dispatch personnel, as well as costs related to technical publications, lodging of our flight crews, and pilot training expenses.\nFuel. Fuel expense includes fuel and related fueling costs for flying we undertake outside of our capacity purchase agreements and flight services agreement, including aircraft repositioning and maintenance. All aircraft fuel and related fueling costs for flying under our capacity purchase agreements were directly paid and supplied by our major partners. The fuel and related cost for flying under our DHL FSA were directly paid and supplied by DHL. Accordingly, we do not record an expense or the related revenue for fuel supplied by American and United for flying under our capacity purchase agreements or DHL under our flight services agreement except fuel costs incurred for controllable ferry flights for American and United.\nMaintenance. Maintenance expense includes costs related to engine overhauls, airframe, landing gear and normal recurring maintenance, which includes pass-through maintenance costs related to our E-175 aircraft. Heavy maintenance and major overhaul costs on our owned E-175 fleet are deferred and amortized until the earlier of the end of the useful life of the related asset or the next scheduled heavy maintenance event. All other maintenance costs are expensed as incurred, except for certain maintenance contracts where labor and materials price risks have been transferred to the service provider and require payment on a utilization basis, such as flight hours. Costs incurred for maintenance and repair for utilization maintenance contracts where labor and materials price risks have been transferred to the service provider are charged to maintenance expense based on contractual payment terms. As a result of using the direct expense method for heavy maintenance on the majority of our fleets, the timing of maintenance expense reflected in the financial statements may vary significantly from period to period.\nAircraft Rent. Aircraft rent expense includes costs related to leased engines and aircraft.\nAircraft and Traffic Servicing. Aircraft and traffic servicing expense includes expenses related to our capacity purchase agreements and flight services agreement, including aircraft cleaning, passenger disruption reimbursements, international navigation fees and wages of airport operations personnel, a portion of which are reimbursable by our major partners.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expense includes insurance and taxes, the majority of which are pass-through costs, non-operational administrative employee wages and related expenses, building rents, real property leases, utilities, legal, audit and other administrative expenses.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation expense is a periodic non-cash charge primarily related to aircraft, engine, and equipment depreciation. Amortization expense is a periodic non-cash charge related to our customer relationship intangible asset.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nInterest Expense. Interest expense is interest on our debt to finance purchases of aircraft, engines, and equipment, including amortization of debt financing costs and discounts.\nInterest Income. Interest income includes interest income on our cash and cash equivalent balances.\nLoss on Investments, Net. Loss on investments consists of losses on our investments in equity securities.\nOther Expense. Other expense includes expense derived from activities not classified in any other area of the consolidated statements of income.\nSegment Reporting\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which discrete financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (CODM) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing operating performance. In consideration of ASC 280, Segment Reporting, we are not organized around specific services or geographic regions. We currently operate in one service line providing scheduled flight services in accordance with our capacity purchase agreements and flight services agreement.\nWhile we operate under two (2) separate capacity purchase agreements and one (1) flight services agreement, we do not manage our business based on any performance measure at the individual contract level. Additionally, our CODM uses consolidated financial information to evaluate our performance, which is the same basis on which he communicates our results and performance to our Board of Directors. The CODM bases all significant decisions regarding the allocation of our resources on a consolidated basis. Based on the information described above and in accordance with the applicable literature, management has concluded that we are organized and operated as one (1) operating and reportable segment.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of our Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2022 and 2021\nWe had an operating loss of $189.7 million in our year ended September 30, 2022 compared to operating income of $63.2 million in our year ended September 30, 2021. In our year ended September 30, 2022, we had a net loss of $182.7 million compared to net income of $16.6 million in our year ended September 30, 2021.\nOur operating results for the year ended September 30, 2022 reflect an increase in flight operations expense resulting from increased pilot training as well as a decrease in maintenance expense mainly as a result of fewer C-checks. Additionally, there were no government grant funds utilized as an offset to operating expenses during the year ended September 30, 2022, compared to $119.5 million during the year ended September 30, 2021. Lastly, we recorded impairment charges of $62.1 million on certain of our CRJ aircraft that were classified as held for sale and $109.7 million on certain long-lived and ROU assets in our year ended September 30, 2022.\nOperating Revenues\nYear Ended September 30,\nChange\nOperating revenues ($ in thousands):\nContract\n$\n478,482\n$\n434,518\n$\n43,964\n10.1\n%\nPass-through and other\n52,519\n69,073\n(16,554\n)\n(24.0\n)%\nTotal operating revenues\n$\n531,001\n$\n503,591\n$\n27,410\n5.4\n%\nOperating data(1):\nAvailable seat miles-ASMs (thousands)\n6,674,748\n7,851,798\n(1,177,050\n)\n(15.0\n)%\nBlock hours\n271,511\n323,219\n(51,708\n)\n(16.0\n)%\nRevenue passenger miles-\nRPMs (thousands)\n5,549,595\n5,893,195\n(343,600\n)\n(5.8\n)%\nAverage stage length (miles)\n(152\n)\n(23.0\n)%\nContract revenue per available seat\nmile-CRASM (in cents)\n\u00a2\n7.18\n\u00a2\n5.53\n\u00a2\n1.65\n29.8\n%\nPassengers\n8,083,870\n8,881,431\n(797,561\n)\n(9.0\n)%\n(1)\nThe definitions of certain terms related to the airline industry used in the table can be found under \"Glossary of Airline Terms\" above.\nTotal operating revenue increased by $27.4 million, or 5.4%, during our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, compared to our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. Contract revenue increased by $44.0 million, or 10.1%, primarily due to normalized contractual rates from our major partners and recognition of higher deferred revenue, partially offset by reduced block hours flown and partner utilization penalties compared to the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. The increase in rates compared to the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 is attributable to temporarily reduced rates from our major partners impacting the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 as a result of lower labor costs due to government assistance received during the same period. Our pass-through and other revenue decreased during our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 by $16.6 million, or 24.0%, primarily due to an increase in pass-through maintenance related to our E-175 fleet.\nOperating Expenses\nYear Ended September 30,\nChange\nOperating expenses ($ in thousands):\nFlight operations\n$\n177,038\n$\n162,137\n$\n14,901\n9.2\n%\nMaintenance\n201,930\n217,646\n(15,716\n)\n(7.2\n)%\nAircraft rent\n36,989\n39,345\n(2,356\n)\n(6.0\n)%\nGeneral and administrative\n43,966\n49,855\n(5,889\n)\n(11.8\n)%\nDepreciation and amortization\n81,508\n82,847\n(1,339\n)\n(1.6\n)%\nLease termination\n4,508\n(4,275\n)\n(94.8\n)%\nAsset impairment\n171,824\n-\n171,824\n100.0\n%\nGovernment grant recognition\n-\n(119,479\n)\n119,479\n(100.0\n)%\nOther operating expenses\n7,238\n3,536\n3,702\n104.7\n%\nTotal operating expenses\n$\n720,726\n$\n440,395\n$\n280,331\n63.7\n%\nOperating data:\nAvailable seat miles-ASMs (thousands)\n6,674,748\n7,851,798\n(1,177,050\n)\n(15.0\n)%\nBlock hours\n271,511\n323,219\n(51,708\n)\n(16.0\n)%\nAverage stage length (miles)\n(152\n)\n(23.0\n)%\nDepartures\n137,625\n160,019\n(22,394\n)\n(14.0\n)%\nFlight Operations. Flight operations expense increased by $14.9 million, or 9.2%, to $177.0 million for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, compared to our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in pilot training costs.\nMaintenance. Aircraft maintenance expense decreased $15.7 million, or 7.2%, to $201.9 million for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, compared to our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in C-check expense, Engine overhaul expense, and pass-through maintenance on our E-175 fleet due to overall fewer maintenance events. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in labor and other costs. Total pass-through maintenance expenses reimbursed by our major partners decreased by $8.1 million during fiscal year 2022, compared to fiscal year 2021.\nThe following table presents information regarding our aircraft maintenance costs during our fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021:\nYear Ended September 30,\nChange\nEngine overhaul\n$\n1,924\n$\n14,598\n$\n(12,674\n)\n(86.8\n)%\nPass-through engine overhaul\n21,710\n16,815\n4,895\n29.1\n%\nC-check\n18,910\n30,593\n(11,683\n)\n(38.2\n)%\nPass-through C-check\n3,173\n20,549\n(17,376\n)\n(84.6\n)%\nComponent contracts\n26,223\n25,890\n1.3\n%\nRotable and expendable parts\n26,967\n26,741\n0.8\n%\nOther pass-through\n20,358\n15,963\n4,395\n27.5\n%\nLabor and other\n82,665\n66,497\n16,168\n24.3\n%\nTotal\n$\n201,930\n$\n217,646\n$\n(15,716\n)\n(7.2\n)%\nAircraft Rent. Aircraft rent expense decreased by $2.4 million, or 6.0%, to $37.0 million for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, compared to our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in engine rent due to fewer leased engines as well as a decrease in rent expense from aircraft leases due to the Companys purchase of a previously leased aircraft in March 2021.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expense decreased by $5.9 million, or 11.8%, to $44.0 million for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, compared to our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in property taxes. For our fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, $8.2 million and $15.1 million, respectively, of our insurance and property tax expenses were reimbursed by our major partners.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $1.3 million, or 1.6%, to $81.5 million for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, compared to our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. The decrease is primarily attributable to a portion of our fleet being classified as held for sale during the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, offset by an increase in rotable parts and spare engine depreciation expense as well as amortization of deferred heavy maintenance.\nAsset Impairment. Asset impairment expenses were $62.1 million and $109.7 million for our assets held for sale and long-lived and ROU assets, respectively, for our year ended September 30, 2022 compared to zero and zero for our year ended September 30, 2021. The increase is attributable to impairment charges on certain CRJ aircraft, both held for sale and held for use, and intangible assets of customer relationship during the year ended September 30, 2022.\nLease Termination. Lease termination expense decreased by $4.3 million, or 94.8%, to $0.2 million for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, compared to our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. We incurred a lease termination expense for a CRJ-900 aircraft purchased in March 2021 that was previously leased from Bombardier Capital.\nOther Operating Expenses. Other operating expenses increased by $3.7 million, or 104.7%, to $7.2 million for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 compared to our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. The increase is primarily due to the loss associated with derecognition of lease incentive assets when the Company terminated the leases of CRJ-700 aircraft to GoJet during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.\nGovernment Grant Recognition. Government grant funds decreased by $119.5 million, or 100%, to zero for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 compared to our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. Under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, the government provided the Company with a grant of $56.0 million in payroll support for the period of December 2020 through March 2021, and an additional $52.2 million in payroll support under the American Recovery Plan Act for the period of April 2021 through September 2021. We also received a total of $95.2 million under the CARES Act during the period April 2020 through October 2020, $83.8 million of which was utilized during fiscal 2020 and $11.4 million of which was utilized and recognized as an offset to operating expenses during the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. These government grant programs were no longer available during our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.\nOther Expense\nOther expense increased by $4.2 million, or 10.2%, to $44.9 million for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, compared to our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. The increase is primarily a result of an increase in loss on investments in equity securities of $6.9 million as a result of a reduction in the market price of our investments in common stock and warrants of Archer Aviation, Inc. See Note 8 - Balance Sheet Information in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our investments in equity securities.\nIncome Taxes\nIn our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, our effective tax rate was 22.2% compared to 26.0% in our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. Our tax rate can vary depending on changes in tax laws, adoption of accounting standards, the amount of income we earn in each state and the state tax rate applicable to such income, as well as any valuation allowance required on our state net operating losses.\nWe recorded an income tax (benefit) provision of $(52.0) million and $5.8 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe income tax provision for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 resulted in an effective tax rate of 22.2%, which differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%, primarily due to the impact of state taxes and permanent differences between financial statement and taxable income. In addition to the state effective tax rate impact, other state impacts include changes in the valuation allowance against state net operating losses, expired state attributes, disallowed unrealized losses, and changes in state apportionment and statutory rates.\nThe income tax provision for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 resulted in an effective tax rate of 26.0%, which differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%, primarily due to the impact of state taxes and permanent differences between financial statement and taxable income. In addition to the state effective tax rate impact, other state impacts include changes in the valuation allowance against state net operating losses, expired state attributes, disallowed unrealized losses, and changes in state apportionment and statutory rates.\nWe continue to maintain a valuation allowance on a portion of our state net operating losses in jurisdictions with shortened carryforward periods or in jurisdictions where our operations have significantly decreased as compared to prior years in which the net operating losses were generated.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had aggregate federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $591.4 million and $247.0 million, which expire in 2027-2038 and 2022-2042, respectively, with approximately $1.1 million of state net operating loss carryforwards that expired in 2022. Approximately $180.9 million of our federal NOL carryforwards are not subject to expiration.\nSee Note 13 - \"Income Taxes\" in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of our Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2021 and 2020\nOperating Revenues\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\nChange\nOperating revenues ($ in thousands):\nContract\n$\n434,518\n$\n506,590\n$\n(72,072\n)\n(14.2\n)%\nPass-through and other\n69,073\n38,480\n30,593\n79.5\n%\nTotal operating revenues\n$\n503,591\n$\n545,070\n$\n(41,479\n)\n(7.6\n)%\nOperating data(1):\nAvailable seat miles-ASMs (thousands)\n7,851,798\n7,581,506\n270,292\n3.6\n%\nBlock hours\n323,219\n313,110\n10,109\n3.2\n%\nRevenue passenger miles-\nRPMs (thousands)\n5,893,195\n5,128,875\n764,320\n14.9\n%\nAverage stage length (miles)\n10.7\n%\nContract revenue per available seat\nmile-CRASM (in cents)\n\u00a2\n5.53\n\u00a2\n6.68\n\u00a2\n(1.15\n)\n(17.2\n)%\nPassengers\n8,881,431\n8,500,072\n381,359\n4.5\n%\n(1)\nThe definitions of certain terms related to the airline industry used in the table can be found under \"Glossary of Airline Terms\" above.\nTotal operating revenue decreased by $41.5 million, or 7.6%, during our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, compared to our fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. Contract revenue decreased by $72.1 million, or 14.2%, primarily due to temporary reductions in rates provided to our major partners as a result of lower labor costs from government assistance received during such period, and flying fewer covered aircraft under the American CPA. Our block hours flown during our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 increased 3.2% compared to our fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, due to an increase in demand for air travel and loosening of certain travel restrictions particularly during the second half of the year, and block hours flown under our DHL Flight Services Agreement which commenced in fiscal 2021. Our pass-through and other revenue increased during our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 by $30.6 million, or 79.5%, primarily due to an increase in pass-through maintenance related to our E-175 fleet.\nOperating Expenses\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\nChange\nOperating expenses ($ in thousands):\nFlight operations\n$\n162,137\n$\n169,242\n$\n(7,105\n)\n(4.2\n)%\nFuel\n33.6\n%\nMaintenance\n217,646\n192,123\n25,523\n13.3\n%\nAircraft rent\n39,345\n48,802\n(9,457\n)\n(19.4\n)%\nAircraft and traffic servicing\n2,638\n3,356\n(718\n)\n(21.4\n)%\nGeneral and administrative\n49,855\n52,246\n(2,391\n)\n(4.6\n)%\nDepreciation and amortization\n82,847\n82,296\n0.7\n%\nLease termination\n4,508\n-\n4,508\n100.0\n%\nGovernment grant recognition\n(119,479\n)\n(83,834\n)\n(35,645\n)\n42.5\n%\nTotal operating expenses\n$\n440,395\n$\n464,903\n$\n(24,508\n)\n(5.3\n)%\nOperating data:\nAvailable seat miles-ASMs (thousands)\n7,851,798\n7,581,506\n270,292\n3.6\n%\nBlock hours\n323,219\n313,110\n10,109\n3.2\n%\nAverage stage length (miles)\n10.7\n%\nDepartures\n160,019\n166,776\n(6,757\n)\n(4.1\n)%\nFlight Operations. Flight operations expense decreased $7.1 million, or 4.2%, to $ 162.1 million for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, compared to our fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in pilot and flight attendant wages and related expenses due to lower departures as well as lower pilot training costs.\nFuel. Fuel expense increased $ 0.2 million, or 33.6%, to $0.9 million for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, compared to our fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by fuel expense related to C-checks and ferry flights. All fuel costs related to flying under our capacity purchase agreements and flight services agreement during our fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 were directly paid to suppliers by our major partners.\nMaintenance. Aircraft maintenance expense increased $25.5 million, or 13.3%, to $217.6 million for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, compared to our fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in C-check expense, labor, rotable and expendable parts, and pass through maintenance on our E-175 fleet due to more maintenance events at higher costs. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in engine overhauls and component contracts. Total pass-through maintenance expenses reimbursed by our major partners increased by $30.0 million during fiscal year 2021, compared to fiscal year 2020.\nThe following table presents information regarding our aircraft maintenance costs during our fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020:\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\nChange\nEngine overhaul\n$\n14,598\n$\n33,472\n$\n(18,874\n)\n(56.4\n)%\nPass-through engine overhaul\n16,815\n7,048\n9,767\n138.6\n%\nC-check\n30,593\n16,279\n14,314\n87.9\n%\nPass-through C-check\n20,549\n7,194\n13,355\n185.6\n%\nComponent contracts\n25,890\n31,105\n(5,215\n)\n(16.8\n)%\nRotable and expendable parts\n26,741\n23,302\n3,439\n14.8\n%\nOther pass-through\n15,963\n9,075\n6,888\n75.9\n%\nLabor and other\n66,497\n64,648\n1,849\n2.9\n%\nTotal\n$\n217,646\n$\n192,123\n$\n25,523\n13.3\n%\nAircraft Rent. Aircraft rent expense decreased $9.5 million, or 19.4%, to $39.3 million for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, compared to our fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in engine rent due to fewer leased engines as well as a decrease in rent expense from aircraft leases due to the Companys purchase of a previously leased aircraft in March 2021.\nAircraft and Traffic Servicing. Aircraft and traffic servicing expense decreased $0.7 million, or 21.4%, to $2.6 million for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, compared to our fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interrupted trip expense, partially offset by an increase in pass-through legal fees related to our leases of CRJ-700 aircraft to a third party. For our fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, 53.0% and 31.4%, respectively, of our aircraft and traffic servicing expenses were reimbursed by our major partners.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expense decreased $2.4 million, or 4.6%, to $49.9 million for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, compared to our fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in general and administrative wages and related expenses, and a decrease in property taxes. For our fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, $15.1 million and $17.5 million, respectively, of our insurance and property tax expenses were reimbursed by our major partners.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $0.6 million, or 0.7%, to $82.8 million for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, compared to our fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in aircraft, rotable parts, deferred heavy maintenance, and spare engine depreciation expense, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of intangible assets.\nLease Termination. Lease termination expense increased $ 4.5 million, or 100.0%, to $4.5 million for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, compared to our fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. We incurred a lease termination expense for a CRJ-900 aircraft purchased in March 2021 that was previously leased from Bombardier Capital.\nGovernment Grant Recognition. Government grant funds increased $35.6 million, or 42.5%, to $119.5 million for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 compared to our fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. Under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, the government provided the Company with a grant of $56.0 million in payroll support for the period of December 2020 through March 2021, and an additional $52.2 million in payroll support under the American Recovery Plan Act for the period of April 2021 through September 2021. We also received a total of $95.2 million under the CARES Act during the period April 2020 through October 2020, $83.8 million of which was utilized during fiscal 2020 and $11.4 million of which was utilized and recognized as an offset to operating expenses during the first quarter of fiscal 2021.\nOther Expense\nOther expense decreased $2.4 million, or 5.5%, to $40.8 million for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, compared to our fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. The decrease is primarily a result of a decrease in interest expense of $9.4 million due to a decrease in outstanding aircraft principal balances and lower interest rates resulting from the Loan and Guarantee Agreement with the U.S. Treasury, offset by losses on investments in equity securities of $6.8 million as a result of a reduction in the market price of our investments in common stock and warrants of Archer Aviation, Inc. See Note 8 - \"Balance Sheet Information\" in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our investments in equity securities.\nIncome Taxes\nIn our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, our effective tax rate was 26.0% compared to 25.8% in our fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. Our tax rate can vary depending on changes in tax laws, adoption of accounting standards, the amount of income we earn in each state and the state tax rate applicable to such income, as well as any valuation allowance required on our state net operating losses.\nWe recorded an income tax provision of $5.8 million and $9.5 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe income tax provision for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 resulted in an effective tax rate of 26.0%, which differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%, primarily due to the impact of state taxes and permanent differences between financial statement and taxable income. In addition to the state effective tax rate impact, other state impacts include changes in the valuation allowance against state net operating losses, expired state attributes, disallowed unrealized losses, and changes in state apportionment and statutory rates.\nThe income tax provision for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 resulted in an effective tax rate of 25.8%, which differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the impact of state taxes and permanent\ndifferences between financial statement and taxable income. In addition to the state effective tax rate impact, other state impacts include changes in the valuation allowance against state net operating losses, expired state attributes, and changes in state apportionment and statutory rates.\nWe continue to maintain a valuation allowance on a portion of our state net operating losses in jurisdictions with shortened carryforward periods or in jurisdictions where our operations have significantly decreased as compared to prior years in which the net operating losses were generated.\nAs of September 30, 2021, we had aggregate federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $541.3 million and $235.7 million, which expire in 2027-2038 and 2022-2042, respectively, with approximately $0.7 million of state net operating loss carryforwards that expired in 2021.\nSee Note 13 - \"Income Taxes\" in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Measures\nWe present Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which are not recognized financial measures under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), as supplemental disclosures because our senior management believes that they are well-recognized valuation metrics in the airline industry that are frequently used by companies, investors, securities analysts, and other interested parties in comparing companies in our industry.\nAdjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for gains and losses on investments, lease termination costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, and write-off of associated financing fees.\nAdjusted EBITDAR. We define Adjusted EBITDAR as net income or loss before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and aircraft rent, adjusted for gains and losses on investments, lease termination costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, and write-off of associated financing fees.\nYou are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR. Gains and losses on investments, which are presented as adjustments to EBITDA and EBITDAR because they are non-cash gains and losses driven by changes in stock prices and other valuation techniques and are not reflective of our core operations, will occur in periods where the Company has investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. There can be no assurance that we will not modify the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDAR and any such modification may be material.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR have limitations as analytical tools. Some of the limitations applicable to these measures include: (i) Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; (ii) Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (iii) Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (iv) Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debts; (v) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future; (vi) Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR do not reflect gains and losses on investments, which are non-cash gains and losses but will occur in periods when there are changes in the value of the Companys investments in equity securities; and (vii) Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements and other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, Adjusted EBITDAR should not be viewed as a measure of overall performance because it excludes aircraft rent, which is a normal, recurring cash operating expense that is necessary to operate our business. For the foregoing reasons, each of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR has significant limitations which affect its use as an indicator of our profitability. Accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this information.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR for the period presented:\nYear Ended September 30,\n(in thousands)\nReconciliation:\nNet (loss) income\n$\n(182,678\n)\n$\n16,588\n$\n27,464\nIncome tax expense\n(51,990\n)\n5,828\n9,531\nIncome before taxes\n$\n(234,668\n)\n$\n22,416\n$\n36,995\nAdjustments(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)\n170,918\n3,558\n-\nLoss on investments, net(6)\n13,715\n6,816\n-\nAdjusted income before taxes\n$\n(50,035\n)\n$\n32,790\n$\n36,995\nInterest expense\n35,289\n34,730\n44,120\nInterest income\n(139\n)\n(365\n)\n(105\n)\nDepreciation and amortization\n81,508\n82,847\n82,296\nAdjusted EBITDA\n66,623\n150,002\n163,306\nAircraft rent\n36,989\n39,345\n48,802\nAdjusted EBITDAR\n$\n103,612\n$\n189,347\n$\n212,108\n(1)\nOur financial results include a loss of $3.2 million from write off of lease incentive assets for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, related to termination of the CRJ-700 leases to GoJet. Additionally, we recognized a lease termination expense of $0.2 million and $4.5 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\n(2)\nOur financial results include a (loss) gain on debt extinguishment of $(0.4) million and $1.0 million related to repayment of the Companys aircraft debts during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n(3)\nOur financial results include impairment charges of $62.1 million during our year ended September 30, 2022, related to certain of our aircraft which were classified as held for sale.\n(4)\nOur financial results include impairment charges of $109.7 million during our year ended September 30, 2022, related to our long-lived asset group for our CRJ-900 fleet.\n(5)\nOur financial results include a gain of $4.7 million on sale of 10 CRJ-700 aircraft during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.\n(6)\nOur financial results reflect losses on our investments in stock of $13.7 million and $6.8 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company has $99.1 million of principal maturity payments on long-term debt due within the next twelve months. We plan to meet these obligations with our cash on hand, ongoing cashflows from our operations, as well as the liquidity created from our plans to sell the remaining eight (8) CRJ-700 aircraft, the 11 CRJ-900 aircraft, and one (1) CRJ-200 aircraft, refinance our revolving credit facility with CIT, and further amend our CPAs. If our plans are not realized, we will be required to explore additional opportunities to create liquidity by refinancing and deferring repayment of our principal maturity payments that are due within the next twelve months. The Company continues to monitor covenant compliance with its lenders as any noncompliance could have a material impact on the Companys financial position, cash flows and results of operations.\nOn April 9, 2020, the Company entered into a letter amendment with lender, Export Development Canada (EDC), which provided for the deferral of scheduled principal payments beginning on March 19, 2020 through September 30, 2020. In November 2020, the Company repaid $164 million of existing debt, which included repayment of $19.9 million of the previously deferred principal payments owed to EDC as of September 30, 2020.\nIn June 2020, the Company amended its RASPRO aircraft agreement to defer a $4.0 million lease payment otherwise due in June 2020. Per the amended agreement dated June 5, 2020, the Company is required to pay this amount over the period of September 2021 through March 2024. The Company made the accounting election available for COVID-19 related concessions provided by a lessor resulting in no change to the related lease accounting.\nIn April 2020, we were granted $92.5 million in emergency relief through the Payroll Support Program of the CARES Act, which was received as of September 30, 2020. In September 2020 we were notified that, based on funding availability, recipients that were currently in compliance with signed payroll support program agreements would receive an approximate 2% increase in their award amount. As a result, we were granted an additional $2.7 million for a total grant of $95.2 million,\nwhich was received in October 2020. Of this amount, $83.8 million was utilized to offset payroll expenses in the year ended September 30, 2020 and the remainder was utilized in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.\nIn February 2021, the Company was granted $48.7 million in financial assistance by the U.S. Department of the Treasury under the Payroll Support Program Extension (PSP2) under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021. In March 2021, the Company was notified that, based on funding availability, recipients that were currently in compliance with executed PSP agreements would receive an additional award amount. As a result, the Company received an additional $7.3 million through PSP2 in April 2021 for a total grant of $56.0 million. PSP2 funding was required to be used exclusively for the continuation of payment of employee wages, salaries, and benefits and is conditioned on our agreement to refrain from conducting involuntary employee layoffs or furloughs from the date of the extension agreement through March 2021. Other conditions include prohibitions on share repurchases and dividends through March 2022 and certain limitations on executive compensation until October 2022. The Department of Transportation also has the authority until March 1, 2022 to require airlines that received payroll support program funds to maintain scheduled air service deemed necessary to any point served by the airline before March 1, 2020.\nOn April 15, 2021, the Company was notified by the U.S. Department of the Treasury that it was eligible to receive funds under the third Payroll Support Program (PSP3), which was created under the American Recovery Plan Act of 2021 (ARP), enacted on March 11, 2021. PSP3 provides additional funding for passenger air carriers and contractors that received financial assistance under PSP2. The funding must be used exclusively for the continuation of payment of employee wages, salaries, and benefits. The Company was granted $52.2 million and received the first PSP3 installment of $26.1 million in April 2021 and the second installment of $26.1 million in May 2021. These payments are conditioned on our agreement to refrain from conducting involuntary employee layoffs or furloughs through September 2021. Other conditions include prohibitions on share repurchases and dividends through September 2022 and certain limitations on executive compensation until April 2023.\nOn October 30, 2020, the Company entered into a Loan and Guarantee Agreement with the U.S Treasury under the CARES Act. The loan agreement provides for a secured term loan facility of up to $200.0 million (the Treasury Loan). On October 30, 2020, the Company borrowed $43.0 million under the Treasury Loan and on November 13, 2020, the Company borrowed an additional $152.0 million. No additional sums are available for borrowing under the Treasury Loan. The obligations under the Treasury Loan are secured by certain aircraft, aircraft engines, accounts receivable, ground service equipment, and tooling (collectively, the Collateral). All principal amounts outstanding under the Treasury Loan are due and payable in a single installment on October 30, 2025 (the Maturity Date) and all accrued interest is payable in arrears on the first business day following the 14th day of each March, June, September and December (beginning with December 15, 2020), and on the Maturity Date. For the first 12 months, interest was paid-in-kind by increasing the principal amount of the loan by the amount of such interest due on an interest payment date. The obligations under the Treasury Loan are guaranteed by the Company and Mesa Air Group Inventory Management. The proceeds may be used for general corporate purposes and operating expenses, to the extent permitted by the CARES Act. Voluntary prepayments of loans under the Treasury Loan may be made, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, at any time. Amounts prepaid may not be reborrowed. Mandatory prepayments of amounts outstanding under the Treasury Loan are required, without premium or penalty, to the extent necessary to comply with the covenants discussed below, certain dispositions of the Collateral, certain debt issuances secured by liens on the Collateral and certain insurance payments related to the Collateral. In addition, if a change of control (as defined in the Treasury Loan) occurs with respect to Mesa Airlines, Mesa Airlines will be required to repay the loans outstanding under the Treasury Loan.\nThe Treasury Loan requires the Company, under certain circumstances, including within one business days prior to the last business day of March and September of each year, beginning March 2021, to appraise the value of the Collateral and recalculate the collateral coverage ratio. If the calculated collateral coverage ratio is less than 1.6 to 1.0, Mesa Airlines will be required either to provide additional Collateral (which may include cash collateral) to secure its obligations under the Treasury Loan or repay the term loans under the Treasury Loan, in such amounts that the recalculated collateral coverage ratio, after giving effect to any such additional Collateral or repayment, is at least 1.6 to 1.0.\nThe Treasury Loan contains two (2) financial covenants, a minimum collateral coverage ratio and a minimum liquidity level. The Treasury Loan also contains customary negative and affirmative covenants for credit facilities of this type, including, among others: (a) limitations on dividends and distributions; (b) limitations on the creation of certain liens; (c) restrictions on certain dispositions, investments and acquisitions; (d) limitations on transactions with affiliates; (e) restrictions on fundamental changes to the business, and (f) restrictions on lobbying activities. Additionally, the Company is required to comply with the relevant provisions of the CARES Act, including limits on employment level reductions after September 30, 2020, restrictions on dividends and stock buybacks, limitations on executive compensation, and requirements to maintain certain levels of scheduled service.\nThe CARES Act provides for deferred payment of the employer portion of social security taxes through the end of 2020. The Company deferred approximately $5.5 million of such taxes, with 50% of the deferred amount to be repaid on December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50% to be repaid on December 31, 2022.\nThese aforementioned forms of relief provided by the CARES Act and other legislation, combined with cost saving initiatives implemented by the Company during the prior fiscal year, provided liquidity during the current and prior year periods.\nWe expect to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months with cash and cash equivalents, financing arrangements, and cash flows from operations. As of September 30, 2022, we had $57.7 million in unrestricted liquidity. Though our financial and operating results reflect the recovery in air travel demand during the second half of our 2021 fiscal year, we continue to monitor the longer-term impact of the pandemic, including its adverse effect on customer demand for air travel, the general economy, and our major partners. Should the effects of COVID-19, variants thereof or a similar pandemic continue long-term, our capital requirements and sources of capital may be adversely impaired. See Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors for additional discussion.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nWe require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements, including outlays for capital expenditures, aircraft and engine pre-delivery payments, maintenance, aircraft rent and debt service obligations, including principal and interest payments. Our cash needs vary from period to period primarily based on the timing and costs of significant maintenance events. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings. In the near term, we expect to fund our primary cash requirements through cash generated from operations and cash and cash equivalents on hand.\nAs discussed above, we entered into the Treasury Loan on October 30, 2020 pursuant to which we borrowed an aggregate of $195.0 million.\nWe believe that the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash include:\n\u25aa\nFactors that affect our results of operations and cash flows, including the impact on our business and operations as a result of changes in demand for our services, competitive pricing pressures, and our ability to achieve further reductions in operating expenses; and\n\u25aa\nFactors that affect our access to bank financing and the debt and equity capital markets that could impair our ability to obtain needed financing on acceptable terms or to respond to business opportunities and developments as they arise, including interest rate fluctuations, macroeconomic conditions, sudden reductions in the general availability of lending from banks or the related increase in cost to obtain bank financing, and our ability to maintain compliance with covenants under our debt agreements in effect from time to time.\nOur ability to service our long-term debt obligations, including our equipment notes, to remain in compliance with the various covenants contained in our debt agreements and to fund our working capital, capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities, which is subject to, among other things, our future operating performance, as well as to other factors, some of which may be beyond our control.\nIf we fail to generate sufficient cash from operations, we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longer-term objectives. There can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings will be available or, if available, will be at rates or prices acceptable to us.\nWe believe that cash flow from operating activities coupled with existing cash and cash equivalents, existing credit facilities, financing arrangements, and government assistance, will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs, as well as enable us to maintain compliance with our various debt agreements, through at least the next 12 months. To the extent that results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans, our liquidity may be adversely impacted.\nDuring the ordinary course of business, we evaluate our cash requirements and, if necessary, adjust operating and capital expenditures to reflect the current market conditions and our projected demand. Our capital expenditures, which includes purchases of spare engines, aircraft, inventory, tools, vehicles, equipment and miscellaneous projects for the year ended September 30, 2022 were approximately 8.5% of annual revenues. We expect to continue to incur capital expenditures to support our business activities. Future capital expenditures may be impacted by events and transactions that are not currently forecasted.\nAs of September 30, 2022, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of $57.7 million. In addition, we had restricted cash of $3.3 million as of September 30, 2022. Restricted cash includes certificates of deposit that secure letters of credit issued for particular airport authorities as required in certain lease agreements. Furthermore, as of September 30, 2022, we also had $615.3 million in secured indebtedness incurred primarily in connection with our financing of aircraft. Our primary uses of liquidity are capital expenditures, operating lease payments, and debt repayments. As of September 30, 2022, we had $94.5 million of short-term debt, excluding finance leases, and $487.2 million of long-term debt excluding finance leases.\nSources of cash for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 were primarily cash flows from operations of $13.4 million. The positive cash flow from operations was driven by receipts from performance under our capacity purchase agreements and flight services agreement and receipt of funds under the Payroll Support Program and related extensions, partially offset by operating expenses including payroll and related costs, aircraft maintenance, rent, interest, and general and administrative costs.\nDebt and Other Obligations\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had $720.7 million of long-term debt (including principal and projected interest obligations) and finance lease obligations (including current maturities). This amount consists of $471.1 million in notes payable principal payments related to owned aircraft used in continuing operations, $110.6 million in notes payable principal payments related to spare engines and engine kits, $18.0 million in finance lease obligations, $15.6 million in principal outstanding under our working capital line of credit, and an aggregate of $105.4 million in projected interest costs through our fiscal 2027.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had variable rate debt representing 73.7% of our total long-term debt. Actual interest commitments will change based on the actual variable interest.\nOperating Leases\nWe have significant long-term operating lease obligations primarily relating to our aircraft fleet, as well as leases of office and hangar space. As of September 30, 2022, we had 16 aircraft on operating leases (excluding aircraft leased at nominal amount from United and DHL) with remaining lease terms of up to 3.8 years. Future minimum lease payments due under all long-term operating leases were approximately $37.2 million as of September 30, 2022.\nA majority of our leased aircraft are leased through trusts formed for the sole purpose of purchasing, financing, and leasing aircraft to us. Because these are single-owner trusts in which we do not participate, we are not at risk for losses and we are not considered the primary beneficiary. We believe that our maximum exposure under the leases are the remaining lease payments and any return condition obligations.\nRASPRO Lease Facility. On September 23, 2005, Mesa Airlines, as lessee, entered into the RASPRO Lease Facility, with RASPRO as lessor, for 15 of our CRJ-900 aircraft. The obligations under the RASPRO Lease Facility are guaranteed by us, and basic rent is paid quarterly on each aircraft. On each of March 10, 2014, June 5, 2014, and December 8, 2017, the RASPRO Lease Facility was amended to defer certain payments of basic rent (the \"Deferred Amounts\"). Until the principal of and accrued interest on the Deferred Amounts are paid in full: (i) we and Mesa Airlines are prohibited from paying any dividends to holders of our common stock, (ii) we are prohibited from repurchasing any of our warrants or other equity interests, (iii) Mesa Airlines must maintain a minimum of $35.0 million of cash, cash equivalents and availability under lines of credit, (iv) Mesa Airlines must provide RASPRO with periodic monthly, quarterly and annual reports containing certain financial information and forecasted engine repair costs and (v) we must maintain a minimum debt-to-assets ratio.\nIn June 2020, the Company amended its RASPRO aircraft lease agreement to defer a $4.0 million lease payment otherwise due in June 2020. Per the amended agreement dated June 5, 2020, the Company is required to pay this amount over the period of September 2021 through March 2024. The Company made the accounting election available for COVID-19 related concessions provided by a lessor. This event is not a lease modification and requires no changes to current accounting treatment. As of September 30, 2022, we were in compliance with the covenants in the RASPRO Lease Facility.\nFinance Leases\nOn February 7, 2018, Mesa Airlines, as lessee, entered into two (2) agreements for the lease of two (2) spare aircraft engines (the \"Engine Leases\"). Basic rent on the engines is paid monthly and at the end of the lease term. At the end of the lease term, Mesa Airlines will have the option to purchase both engines for a total of $1.8 million. The Engine Leases are reflected as finance lease obligations of $2.3 million on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2022. The Engine Leases set forth specific redelivery requirements and conditions, but do not contain operational or financial covenants.\nOn April 20, 2022, Mesa Airlines, as lessee, entered into another agreement for the lease of one spare aircraft engine. Basic rent on this lease is paid monthly and at the end of the lease term. At the end of the lease term, Mesa Airlines will not have the option to purchase the engine. This lease is reflected as finance lease obligations of $0.6 million on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2022.\nOn June 1, 2022, Mesa Airlines, as lessee, entered into two (2) agreements for the lease of two CRJ-700 aircraft (the Aircraft Leases). Basic rent on this lease is paid monthly and at the end of the lease term. At the end of the lease term, Mesa Airlines will have the option to purchase both aircraft for a total of $1.5 million. The Aircraft Leases are reflected as finance lease obligations of $15.1 million on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2022.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had two (2) aircraft and three (3) engines on finance leases with remaining lease terms of up to 7.6 years. Future minimum lease payments due under all long-term operating leases were approximately $21.8 million as of September 30, 2022.\nWorking Capital Line of Credit\nIn August 2016, we, as guarantor, our wholly owned subsidiaries, Mesa Airlines and MAG-AIM, as borrowers, CIT, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto (the CIT Lenders), entered into the CIT Revolving Credit Facility, pursuant to which the CIT Lenders committed to lend to Mesa Airlines and MAG-AIM revolving loans in the aggregate principal amount of up to $35.0 million. The borrowers' and guarantor's obligations under the CIT Revolving Credit Facility are secured primarily by a first priority lien on certain engines, spare parts, and related collateral, including engine warranties and proceeds of the foregoing. The CIT Revolving Credit Facility contains affirmative, negative, and financial covenants that are typical in the industry for similar financings, including, but not limited to, covenants that, subject to exceptions described in the CIT Revolving Credit Facility, restrict our ability and the ability of Mesa Airlines and MAG-AIM and their subsidiaries to: (i) enter into, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any liens; (ii) merge, dissolve, liquidate, consolidate or sell or transfer substantially all of its assets; (iii) sell assets; (iv) enter into transactions with affiliates; (v) amend certain material agreements and organizational documents; (vi) make consolidated unfinanced capital expenditures; or (viii) maintain a consolidated interest and rental coverage ratio above the amount specified in the CIT Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2022, we were in compliance with the financial covenants under the CIT Revolving Credit Facility. The CIT Revolving Credit Facility also includes customary events of defaults, including but not limited to: (i) payment defaults; (ii) breach of covenants; (iii) breach of representations and warranties; (iv) cross-defaults; (v) certain bankruptcy-related defaults; (vi) change of control; and (vii) revocation of instructions with respect to certain controlled accounts.\nOn September 25, 2019, the Company extended the term on its $35.0 million working capital draw loan by three years, which now terminates in December 2022. Interest is assessed on drawn amounts at one-month LIBOR plus 3.75%. In June 2020, $23.0 million was drawn to cover operational needs. As of September 30, 2022, $15.6 million remained outstanding under the working capital draw loan.\nEngine Purchase Commitments\nOn February 26, 2021, the Company and General Electric Company (GE), acting through its GE-Aviation business unit, entered into an Amended and Restated Letter Agreement No. 13-3. The Company agreed to purchase and take delivery of 10 new CF34-8C5 or CF34-8E5 engines with delivery dates starting from July 1, 2021 through November 30, 2022. During the quarter ended March 31, 2021, a $7.0 million non-refundable purchase deposit was made for the first five (5) engines to be delivered in calendar 2021. The Company has options to purchase an additional 10 similar engines beyond 2022. The total purchase commitment related to these 10 engines is approximately $52.2 million. As of September 30, 2022, we have purchased nine (9) of the engines pursuant to the Amended and Restated Letter Agreement No. 13-3 with delivery of the remaining three (3) engines expected to take place by the end of 2022 calendar year.\nIf the Company fails to accept delivery of the spare engines when duly tendered, the Company may be assessed a minimum cancellation charge based on the engine price determined as of the date of scheduled engine delivery to the Company.\nElectric Aircraft Forward Purchase Commitments\nAs described in Note 8, in February 2021, the Company entered into a forward purchase contract with Archer Aviation, Inc. (Archer) for a number of electrically-powered vertical takeoff and landing aircraft (eVTOL aircraft). The aggregate base commitment for the eVTOL aircraft is $200.0 million, with an option to purchase additional aircraft. The Companys obligation to purchase the eVTOL aircraft is subject to the Company and Archer first agreeing in the future to a number of terms and conditions, which may or may not be met.\nAs described in Note 8, in July 2021, the Company entered into a forward purchase contract with Heart Aerospace Incorporated (Heart) for a number of fully electric aircraft. The maximum aggregate base commitment for the aircraft is $1,200.0 million, with an option to purchase additional aircraft. The Companys obligation to purchase the aircraft is subject to the Company and Heart first agreeing in the future to a number of terms and conditions, which may or may not be met.\nMaintenance Commitments\nIn August 2005, we entered into a ten-year agreement with AAR for the maintenance and repair of certain of our CRJ-200, CRJ-700, and CRJ-900 aircraft. The agreement has since been amended to include a term extending through 2025, and to provide certain E-175 aircraft rotable spare parts with a term through December 2027. Under the agreements, we pay AAR a monthly access fee per aircraft for certain consigned inventory as well as a fixed \"cost per flight hour\" fee on a monthly basis for repairs on certain repairable parts during the term of the agreement, which fees are subject to annual adjustment based on increases in the cost of labor and component parts.\nIn July 2013, we entered into an engine maintenance contract with GE to perform heavy maintenance on certain CRJ-700, CRJ-900, and E-175 engines based on a fixed pricing schedule. The pricing may escalate annually in accordance with GE's spare parts catalog for engines. The engine maintenance contract extends through 2024.\nIn 2014, we entered into a ten-year contract with Aviall to provide maintenance and repair services on the wheels, brakes and tires of our CRJ-700 and CRJ-900 aircraft. Under the agreement, we pay Aviall a fixed \"cost per landing\" fee for all landings of our aircraft during the term of the agreement, which fee is subject to annual adjustment based on increases in the cost of labor and component parts.\nWe entered into an engine maintenance contract with StandardAero, which became effective on June 1, 2015, to perform heavy maintenance on certain CRJ-700 and CRJ-900 engines based on a fixed pricing schedule. The pricing may escalate annually in accordance with the GE's spare parts catalog for engines.\nOur employees perform routine airframe and engine maintenance along with periodic inspections of equipment at their respective maintenance facilities. We also use third-party vendors, such as AAR, Ascent, Embraer, Aviall, and GE, for certain heavy airframe and engine maintenance work, along with parts procurement and component overhaul services for our aircraft fleet. As of September 30, 2022, $50.6 million of parts inventory was consigned to us by AAR and Aviall under long-term contracts that is not reflected on our balance sheet.\nThe Company accounts for heavy maintenance and major overhaul costs on its owned E-175 fleet under the deferral method whereby the cost of heavy maintenance and major overhaul is deferred and amortized until the earlier of the end of the useful life of the related asset or the next scheduled heavy maintenance event. For all other fleets, we use the direct expense method of accounting for our maintenance of regional jet engine overhauls, airframe, landing gear, and normal recurring maintenance wherein we recognize the expense when the maintenance work is completed, or over the repair period, if materially different, except for certain maintenance contracts where labor and materials price risks have been transferred to the service provider and require payment on a utilization basis, such as flight hours . Costs incurred for maintenance and repair for utilization maintenance contracts where labor and materials price risks have been transferred to the service provider are charged to maintenance expense based on contractual payment terms. Our maintenance policy is determined by fleet when major maintenance is incurred. While we keep a record of expected maintenance events, the actual timing and costs of major engine maintenance expense are subject to variables such as estimated usage, government regulations and the level of unscheduled maintenance events and their actual costs. Accordingly, we cannot reliably quantify the costs or timing of future maintenance-related expenses for any significant period of time.\nRestricted Cash\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had $3.3 million in restricted cash. We have an agreement with a financial institution for a $6.0 million letter of credit facility and to issue letters of credit for landing fees, worker's compensation insurance and other business needs. Pursuant to such agreement, $3.3 million and $3.4 million of outstanding letters of credit are required to be collateralized by amounts on deposit as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which are classified as restricted cash.\nCash Flows\nThe following table presents information regarding our cash flows for each of our fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020:\nYear Ended September 30,\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n13,362\n$\n132,871\n$\n174,662\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n1,365\n(33,471\n)\n(26,667\n)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(77,569\n)\n(78,374\n)\n(117,655\n)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n(62,842\n)\n$\n21,026\n$\n30,340\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period\n123,867\n102,841\n72,501\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period\n$\n61,025\n$\n123,867\n$\n102,841\nNet Cash Flow Provided by Operating Activities\nOur primary source of cash from operating activities is cash collections from our major partners pursuant to our CPAs and FSA. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for maintenance costs, personnel costs, operating lease payments, and interest payments.\nDuring our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we had cash flow provided by operating activities of $13.4 million. We had net loss of $182.7 million adjusted for the following significant non-cash items: asset impairment of $171.8 million, depreciation and amortization of $81.5 million, stock-based compensation expense of $2.8 million, deferred income taxes of $(52.0) million, losses on investments in equity securities of $13.7 million, amortization of deferred credits of $(0.9) million, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and accretion of interest of $9.7 million, loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.4 million, gain on disposal of assets of $(4.7) million, provision for obsolete expendable parts and supplies of $0.6 million, and loss on lease termination of $0.2 million.

We had net change of $50.4 million within other net operating assets and liabilities largely driven by increases in accrued liabilities and deferred revenue during our fiscal year ended September 30, 2020.\nNet Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities\nOur investing activities generally consist of capital expenditures for aircraft and related flight equipment, deposits paid or returned for equipment and other purchases, and strategic investments.\nDuring our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, our net cash flow provided by investing activities was $1.4 million. We invested $16.7 million in spare engines, $1.3 million in aircraft, $18.4 million in inventory, $4.4 million in tools, vehicles, equipment and other miscellaneous projects, and $7.6 million in net payments on equipment and other deposits. Additionally, we invested a total of $0.2 million in equity securities and received a total of $50.0 million from sale of 10 CRJ-700 aircraft.\nDuring our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, our net cash flow used in investing activities was $33.5 million. We invested $3.5 million in spare engines, $1.6 million in aircraft, $9.9 million in inventory, $2.1 million in tools, vehicles, equipment and other miscellaneous projects, and $6.3 million in net payments on equipment and other deposits. Additionally, we invested a total of $10.0 million in equity securities.\nDuring our fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, our net cash flow used in investing activities was $26.7 million. We invested $11.0 million in two (2) spare engines and $3.8 million in aircraft improvements, $9.4 million in inventory, and $2.5 million in tools and miscellaneous projects.\nNet Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities\nOur financing activities generally consist of debt borrowings, principal repayments of debt, payment of debt financing costs, stock repurchases, and proceeds received from issuing common stock under our ESPP.\nDuring our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, our net cash flow used in financing activities was $77.6 million. We received $39.8 million of proceeds from borrowings under the Treasury Loan. We made $114.9 million of principal repayments on long-term debt during the period. We incurred $2.4 million of costs related to debt financing and $0.5 million of costs related to the repurchase of shares of our common stock. We received $0.4 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our ESPP.\nDuring our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, our net cash flow used in financing activities was $78.4 million. We received $195.0 million of proceeds from borrowings under the Treasury Loan. We made $271.0 million of principal repayments on long-term debt during the period. We incurred $1.3 million of costs related to debt financing and $1.5 million of costs related to the repurchase of shares of our common stock. We received $0.5 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our ESPP.\nDuring our fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, our net cash flow used in financing activities was $117.7 million. We drew $23.0 million from our $35.0 million working capital draw loan for operational needs. We made $138.3 million of principal repayments on long-term debt during the period. We incurred $1.8 million of costs related to debt financing and $0.6 million of costs related to the repurchase of shares of our common stock.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In doing so, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations would be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates, which we discuss below.\nThe discussion below is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 - \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the consolidated financial statements.\nLeases\nEffective October 1, 2019, we adopted ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (\"ASU 2016-02\" or ASC 842) which provides guidance requiring lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for substantially all leases, with the exception of short-term leases with terms of less than 12 months. From a lessee perspective, our leases are classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of income. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our operating lease activities are recorded in operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets, current maturities of operating leases, and noncurrent operating lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, current portion of long-term debt and finance leases, and long-term debt and finance leases, excluding current portion.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Variable lease payments are not included in the calculation of the right-of-use assets and lease liability due to uncertainty of the payment amount and are recorded as lease expense in the period incurred. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We use the implicit rate when readily determinable. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nIn addition to the aircraft we lease from United under our United CPA and from DHL under our DHL FSA, approximately 10% of our aircraft are leased from third parties. All of our aircraft leases have been classified as operating leases, which\nresults in rental payments being charged to expense over the term of the related leases. In the event that we or one of our major partners decide to exit an activity involving leased aircraft, losses may be incurred. In the event that we exit an activity that results in exit losses, these losses are accrued as each aircraft is removed from operations for early termination penalties, lease settle up, and other charges. Additionally, any remaining ROU assets and lease liabilities will be written off.\nAs a lessee, we elected a short-term lease exception policy on all classes of underlying assets, permitting us to not apply the recognition requirements of this standard to short-term leases (i.e., leases with terms of 12 months or less).\nFrom a lessor perspective, our capacity purchase agreements identify the \"right of use\" of a specific type and number of aircraft over a stated period-of-time. A portion of the compensation in the capacity purchase agreements is designed to reimburse the Company for certain aircraft ownership costs of these aircraft. We account for the non-lease component of our capacity purchase agreements under ASC 606 and account for the lease component under ASC 842. We allocate the consideration in the contract between the lease and non-lease components based on their stated contract prices, which is based on a cost-basis approach representing our estimate of the stand-alone selling prices.\nThe Company entered into lease agreements with GoJet Airlines LLC (GoJet) to lease CRJ-700 aircraft as of September 30, 2021. The lease agreements are accounted for as operating leases and have a term of nine (9) years beginning on the delivery date of each aircraft. Under the lease agreements, GoJet pays fixed monthly rent per aircraft and variable lease payments for supplemental rent based on monthly aircraft utilization at fixed rates. Supplemental rent payments are subject to reimbursement following GoJets completion of qualifying maintenance events defined in the lease agreements. Lease revenue for fixed monthly rent payments is recognized on a straight-line basis within contract revenue. Lease revenue for supplemental rent is deferred and recognized within contract revenue when it is probable that amounts received will not be reimbursed for future qualifying maintenance events over the lease term. During August of 2022, we committed to a formal plan to sell 18 of our CRJ-700 aircraft and subsequently terminated the leases on the 18 CRJ-700 aircraft. In September 2022, we sold 10 CRJ-700 aircraft for $50.0 million. We continue to be committed to selling the remaining eight (8) aircraft.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue when the service is provided under its capacity purchase agreements and flight services agreement. Under these agreements, the major partners generally pay a fixed monthly minimum amount per aircraft, plus certain additional amounts based upon the number of flights and block hours flown. The contracts also include reimbursement of certain costs incurred by the Company in performing flight services. These costs, known as \"pass-through costs,\" may include passenger and hull insurance as well as aircraft property taxes and other flight service expenditures defined in our agreements with our major partners. Additionally, for the E-175 aircraft owned by United, the capacity purchase agreement provides that United will reimburse the Company for heavy airframe and engine maintenance, landing gear, APUs and component maintenance. The Company also receives compensation under its agreements for heavy maintenance expenses at a fixed hourly rate or per aircraft rate for all aircraft in scheduled service other than the E-175 aircraft owned by United. The contracts also include a profit margin on certain reimbursable costs, as well as a profit margin, incentives and penalties based on certain operational benchmarks. The Company is eligible to receive incentive compensation upon the achievement of certain performance criteria defined in the agreements. At the end of each period during the term of an agreement, the Company calculates the incentives achieved during that period and recognizes revenue attributable to the agreement during the period accordingly, subject to the variable constraint guidance under ASC 606. All revenue recognized under these contracts is presented as the gross amount billed to the major partners.\nUnder the capacity purchase and flight services agreements, the Company has committed to perform various activities that can be generally classified into in-flight services and maintenance services. When evaluating these services, the Company determined that the nature of its promise is to provide a single integrated service, flight services, because its contracts require integration and assumption of risk associated with both services to effectively deliver and provide the flights as scheduled over the contract term. Therefore, the in-flight services and maintenance services are inputs to that combined integrated flight service. Both services occur over the term of the agreement and the performance of maintenance services significantly affects the utility of the in-flight services. The Company's individual flights flown under the capacity purchase and flight services agreements are deemed to be distinct and the flight service promised in the capacity purchase and flight services agreements represents a series of services that is accounted for as a single performance obligation. This single performance obligation is satisfied over time as the flights are completed. Therefore, revenue is recognized when each flight is completed.\nIn allocating the transaction price, variable payments (i.e., billings based on flights and block hours flown, pass-through costs, etc.) that relate specifically to the Company's efforts in performing flight services are recognized in the period in which the individual flight is completed. The Company has concluded that allocating the variability directly to the individual flights results in an overall allocation meeting the objectives in ASC 606. This results in a pattern of revenue recognition that follows the variable amounts billed from the Company to their customers.\nA portion of the Company's compensation under its capacity purchase agreements with American and United is designed to reimburse the Company for certain aircraft ownership costs. The Company has concluded that a component of its revenue under these agreements is deemed to be lease revenue, as such agreements identify the \"right of use\" of a specific type and number of aircraft over a stated period-of-time. The lease revenue associated with the Company's capacity purchase agreements is accounted for as an operating lease and is reflected as contract revenue on the Company's consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. The Company recognized $158.4 million, $170.2 million, and $208.9 million of lease revenue for the year ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The Company has not separately stated aircraft rental income and aircraft rental expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income because the use of the aircraft is not a separate activity of the total service provided.\nThe Company's capacity purchase agreements and flight services agreement are renewable periodically and contain provisions pursuant to which the parties could terminate their respective agreements, subject to certain conditions, as described in Note 1. The capacity purchase agreements and flight services agreement also contain terms with respect to covered aircraft, services provided, and compensation as described in Note 1. The capacity purchase agreements and flight services agreement are amended from time to time to change, add, or delete terms of the agreements.\nThe Company's revenues could be impacted by a number of factors, including amendment or termination of its capacity purchase agreements or flight services agreement, contract modifications resulting from contract renegotiations, its ability to earn incentive payments contemplated under applicable agreements, and settlement of reimbursement disputes with the Company's major partners. In the event contracted rates are not finalized at a quarterly or annual financial statement date, the Company evaluates the enforceability of its contractual terms and when it has an enforceable right, it estimates the amount the Company expects to be entitled subject to the variable constraint guidance under ASC 606.\nThe Company's capacity purchase agreements and flight services agreement contain an option that allows its major partners to assume the contractual responsibility for procuring and providing the fuel necessary to operate the flights that it operates for them. The Company's major partners have exercised this option. Accordingly, the Company does not record an expense or revenue for fuel and related fueling costs for flying under its capacity purchase agreements or flight services agreement. In addition, the Company's major partners also provide, at no cost to the Company, certain ground handling and customer service functions, as well as airport-related facilities and gates at their hubs and other cities. Services and facilities provided by the Company's major partners at no cost are presented net in its consolidated financial statements; hence, no amounts are recorded for revenue or expense for these items.\nThe Company records deferred revenue when cash payments are received or are due from our major partners in advance of the Companys performance. The deferred revenue balance as of September 30, 2022 of $24.1 million (current and non-current portion) represents our aggregate remaining performance obligations that will be recognized as revenue over the period in which the performance obligations are satisfied (as flights are completed over the remaining contract term).\nProperty and Equipment\nThe Companys property and equipment, which primarily consists of aircraft and related flight equipment, had a net book value of $865.3 million as of September 30, 2022. The Company monitors for any indicators of impairment of its property and equipment and other long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may be impaired. Factors which could be indicators of impairment include, but are not limited to: (i) significant adverse changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used, including permanently removing a long-lived asset or assets from operations; (ii) significant changes in the estimated useful life of an asset; (iii) significant changes in estimated future cash flows or a history of operating or cash flow losses; (iv) permanent and significant declines in market prices of an asset; and (v) changes to the regulatory environment or business climate. The Company records an impairment loss if (i) the undiscounted future cash flows are found to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, and (ii) the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. If an impairment loss has occurred, a charge is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value.\nWe group assets at the capacity purchase agreement, flight services agreement, and fleet-type level (i.e., the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows). If impairment indicators exist with respect to any of our asset groups, we estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity purchase or flight services agreement, block hours, maintenance events, labor costs and other relevant factors. The Companys assumptions about future conditions are important to its assessment of potential impairment of its long-lived assets, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to its business and impact of pilot shortage, are subject to uncertainty, and the Company will continue to monitor these conditions in future periods as new information becomes available, and will update its analyses accordingly. If an asset group is impaired, the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the asset groups carrying amount exceeds its fair value. We estimate fair values of aircraft and related assets using published sources, appraisals, and bids received from third parties as available.\nAs a result of pilot shortage, we evaluated our fleet during fiscal year 2022 and determined that only the CRJ-900 fleet operating under the American CPA was impaired as discussed in Note 8 - Balance sheet information in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, because the future cash flows from the operation of other asset groups through the respective remaining useful life exceeded the carrying value. This resulted in total impairment charges of $109.7 million to the asset group for the CRJ-900 fleet operating under the American CPA, recorded in asset impairment on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. These charges were calculated using Level 3 fair value inputs based primarily upon recent market transactions and third-party bids, which were corroborated with published pricing guides and our assessment of existing market conditions based on industry knowledge. See Note 8 - \"Balance sheet information\" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized.\nIn determining the amount of the valuation allowance, estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies for each taxing jurisdiction are considered. If we determine it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the remaining deferred tax assets will not be realized, the valuation allowance will be increased with a charge to income tax expense. Conversely, if we determine we are more likely than not to be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided, the related portion of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a reduction to income tax expense.\nWe recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that is it more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. For tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement. Our practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. Evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of tax audits and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in income tax expense in the period in which the change is made, which could have a material impact to our effective tax rate. See Note 13 - \"Income Taxes\" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. See also \"Management's Discussion and Analysis-Results of Operations-Income Taxes\" for additional information.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nWe are an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the JOBS Act). The JOBS Act permits us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to \"opt out\" of this provision and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards when they are required to be adopted by public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 4 - \"Recent Accounting Pronouncements\" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFor a listing and discussion of our accounting policies, see Note 2 - \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are subject to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks include interest rate risk and, on a limited basis, commodity price risk with respect to foreign exchange transactions. The adverse effects of changes in these markets could pose a potential loss as discussed below. The sensitivity analysis provided does not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity, nor does it consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes. Actual results may differ.\nInterest Rate Risk. We are subject to market risk associated with changing interest rates on our variable rate long-term debt; the variable interest rates are based on LIBOR. The interest rates applicable to variable rate notes may rise and increase the amount of interest expense on our variable rate long-term debt. We do not purchase or hold any derivative instruments to protect against the effects of changes in interest rates.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had $453.2 million of variable rate debt including current maturities. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in market interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately $1.1 million in our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had $167.9 million of fixed rate debt, including current maturities. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in market interest rates would not impact interest expense or have a material effect on the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments as of September 30, 2022.\nForeign Currency Risk. We have de minimis foreign currency risks related to our station operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Canadian dollar. Our revenue is U.S. dollar denominated. To date, foreign currency transaction gains and losses have not been material to our financial statements and we have not had a formal hedging program with respect to foreign currency. A 10% increase or decrease in current exchange rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\nFuel Price Risk. Unlike other airlines, our capacity purchase agreements and flight services agreement largely shelter us from volatility related to fuel prices, which are directly paid and supplied by our major partners. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nPage\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nConsolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe information set forth below should be read together with \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Mesa Air Group, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Mesa Air Group, Inc. (the Company) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2022 and 2021 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2019.\nPhoenix, Arizona\nDecember 29, 2022\nMESA AIR GROUP,

Statements\n1.\nOrganization and Operations\nThe Company\nHeadquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, Mesa Air Group, Inc. (\"Mesa\" or the \"Company\") is the holding company of Mesa Airlines, a regional air carrier providing scheduled passenger service to 107 cities in 39 states, the District of Columbia, the Bahamas, and Mexico as well as cargo services out of Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. As of September 30, 2022, Mesa operated a fleet of 158 aircraft with approximately 306 daily departures and 2,454 employees. Mesas fleet were operated conducted under the Companys Capacity Purchase Agreements (CPAs) and Flight Services Agreement (FSA), leased to a third party, held for sale or maintained as operational spares. Mesa operates all of its flights as either American Eagle, United Express, or DHL Express flights pursuant to the terms of CPAs entered into with American Airlines, Inc. (American) and United Airlines, Inc. (United) and FSA with DHL Network Operations (USA), Inc. (DHL) (each, our major partner). All of the Companys consolidated contract revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were derived from operations associated with these two (2) CPAs, FSA, and leases of aircraft to a third party.\nThe CPAs between us and our major partners involve a revenue-guarantee arrangement whereby the major partners pay fixed-fees for each aircraft under contract, departure, flight hour (measured from takeoff to landing, excluding taxi time) or block hour (measured from takeoff to landing, including taxi time), and reimbursement of certain direct operating expenses in exchange for providing flight services. The major partners also pay certain expenses directly to suppliers, such as fuel, ground operations and landing fees. Under the terms of these CPAs, the major partners control route selection, pricing, and seat inventories, reducing our exposure to fluctuations in passenger traffic, fare levels, and fuel prices. Under our FSA with DHL, we receive a fee per block hour with a minimum block hour guarantee in exchange for providing cargo flight services. Ground support expenses including fueling and airport fees are paid directly by DHL.\nImpact of Pilot Shortage and Attrition\nImpact of Pilot Shortage\nDuring our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the severity of the pilot shortage, elevated pilot attrition, and increasing costs associated with pilot wages adversely impacted our financial results, cash flows, financial position, and other key financial ratios. One of the primary factors contributing to the pilot shortage and attrition is the demand for pilots at major carriers, which are hiring at an accelerated rate. These airlines now seek to increase their capacity to meet the growing demand for air travel as the global pandemic has moderated. A primary source of pilots for the major US passenger and cargo carriers are the US regional airlines.\nAs a result of pilot shortage and attrition, we produced less block hours to generate revenues and incurred penalties for operational shortfalls under our CPAs. These challenges resulted in a negative impact on the Companys financial results highlighted by operating cash flows of $13.4 million and net loss of $182.7 million including a non-cash impairment charge related to the Companys American asset group of $171.8 million. These conditions and events raised financial concerns about our ability to continue to fund our operations and meet debt obligation in the next twelve months.\nTo address the events that gave rise to such concerns, management developed and implemented the following material changes to its business designed to ensure the Company could continue to fund its operations and meet its debt obligations over the next 12 months. In addition to successfully implementing these effective measures, the Company expects to develop and implement additional measures aimed at addressing periods beyond the next 12 months.\n\u25aa\nIn the fourth quarter, the Company reached an agreement with ALPA which increased overall pilot hourly pay by nearly 118% for captains and 172% for new-hire first officers. As a result of this agreement, we have experienced reduced attrition rates and attracted new pilots.\n\u25aa\nThe Company and American have agreed to terminate and complete a wind-down of the American CPA. This will ultimately eliminate financial penalties incurred under the American CPA. In December 2022, we entered into Amendment No.11 to our American CPA. See the disclosure under Note 18 - \"Subsequent Events\" in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of Amendment No. 11 which includes among other things, disclosure regarding the wind-down of our operations with American and the termination of the American CPA.\n\u25aa\nIn December 2022, we entered into the Third Amended and Restated Capacity Purchase Agreement with United which amended and restated the existing United CPA. This agreement increases block hour revenues to cover increased wages agreed to with ALPA and adds CRJ 900 aircraft currently operating under the American CPA. See the disclosure under Note 18 - \"Subsequent Events\" in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statement included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the Amended and Restated United\nCPA which includes among others, disclosure regarding the transition of the aircraft operated under the American CPA to be operated under the Third Amended and Restated United CPA.\n\u25aa\nWe entered into an agreement with United to sell 18 CRJ-700 aircraft during the reporting period, of which 10 were sold. The approximate net proceeds from the sale in the quarter was $ 36.8 million after retirement of debt. The remaining eight (8) are expected to close in early January 2022. The approximate net proceeds from the sale and after retirement of debt is $8 million.\n\u25aa\nWe entered into an agreement with a third party to sell eleven (11) of our CRJ-900 aircraft and one CRJ-200 aircraft to raise capital and retire debt. The approximate net proceeds from the sale are expected to be $8.2 million after retirement of debt.\n\u25aa\nWe entered into an agreement to sell 30 spare engines to United to raise capital and retire debt. The approximate gross proceeds from the sale are expected to be $80 million and will retire debt of $26.4 million.\n\u25aa\nWe established a new line of credit totaling $25.5 million to draw upon when needed. See the disclosure under Note 18 - \"subsequent Events\" in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the line of credit and amount drawn upon subsequently.\n\u25aa\nWe entered into an agreement with Export Development Bank of Canada (EDC), reducing debt and interest payments on all seven aircraft for the period of January 2023 through December 2024, providing up to $14 million of liquidity. Additionally, the junior noteholder MHIRJ agreed to reduce its loan amount by approximately $5 million.\n\u25aa\nWe entered into an agreement with RASPRO Trust, reducing the buyout pricing on all 15 aircraft at lease termination by a total of $25 million.\n\u25aa\nWe established the Mesa Pilot Development Program (the \"MPD Program\") to increase the pilot supply to Mesa.. We have entered into an agreement to purchase up to 29 state-of-the-art Pipistrel Alpha Trainer 2 aircraft. This new fleet will be the backbone of our MPD Program to help commercial pilots accelerate their accumulation of flight hours to reach the minimum flight hours required by FAA and then be hired by Mesa. As part of the program, pilots will be provided with the opportunity to accumulate up to 1,500 flight hours required to fly a commercial aircraft at Mesa Airlines. Flights costs of $25 per hour, per pilot, will be fully financed by us with zero interest, providing no upfront out-of-pocket expense for flight time while the candidate is accruing the required hours to earn their ATP certificate.\n\u25aa\nWe added flight training simulators and flight training instructors to expand our training capacity to backfill pilots lost to attrition.\n\u25aa\nWe have expanded the United Aviate program participation to include all pilots flying for Mesa. Previously, pilots had to fly under the United Express contract for a minimum of two (2) years to qualify for the flow through to United Airlines. Now, all pilots regardless of contract, are eligible to flow through to United Airlines enhancing Mesa's ability to attract and retain pilots.\n\u25aa\nWe have delayed and/or deferred major spending on aircraft and engine maintenance to match the current and projected level of flight activity.\nThese plans and initiatives outlined above have effectively alleviated pressure on financial performance. While we continue implement and monitor our plans and initiatives, there is no guarantee that these will continue to be effective and achieve their desired objectives.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company has $97.2 million of short-term debt due within the next twelve months. We plan to meet these obligations with our cash on hand, ongoing cashflows from our operations, as well as the liquidity we have achieved as outlined above.\nAmerican Capacity Purchase Agreement\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company operated 42 CRJ-900 aircraft under an Amended and Restated Capacity Purchase Agreement with American dated November 19, 2020 (as amended, the American CPA). In exchange for providing passenger flight services, we receive a fixed monthly minimum amount per aircraft under contract plus certain additional amounts based upon the number of flights and block hours flown during each month. In addition, we may also receive incentives or incur penalties based upon our operational performance, including controllable on-time departure (CD0) and controllable flight completion (CCF) percentages. American also reimburses us for certain costs on an actual basis, including passenger liability and hull insurance and aircraft property taxes. Other expenses, including fuel and certain landing fees, are directly paid to suppliers by American. In addition, American also provides, at no cost to us, certain ground handling and customer service functions as well as airport-related facilities and gates at American hubs and cities where we operate. The American CPA expires on December 31, 2025.\nOur American CPA is subject to termination prior to its expiration, subject to our right to cure, in various circumstances including:\n\u25aa\nIf either American or we become insolvent, file for bankruptcy, or fail to pay the debts as they become due, the non-defaulting party may terminate the agreement;\n\u25aa\nIf either we or American fail to perform the covenants, conditions, or provisions of the American CPA, subject to certain notice and cure rights, the non-defaulting party may terminate the agreement;\n\u25aa\nIf, at any time during the term of the American CPA, the number of covered aircraft is less than twenty (20);\n\u25aa\nIf we are required by the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) to suspend operations and we have not resumed operations within three (3) business days, except as a result of an emergency airworthiness directive from the FAA affecting all similarly equipped aircraft;\n\u25aa\nIf either our CCF or CD0 falls below certain levels for a specified period of time;\n\u25aa\nUpon the occurrence of a force majeure event (as defined in the American CPA) that lasts for a specified period of consecutive days and affects our ability to operate scheduled flights, including a future epidemic or pandemic;\n\u25aa\nIf a labor dispute affects our ability to operate over a specified number of days or we operate in violation of any existing American collective bargaining agreement; or\n\u25aa\nUpon a change in our ownership or control without the written approval of American.\nUnder the American CPA, American had the option in its sole discretion to withdraw up to: (i) 10 aircraft during calendar year 2021, (ii) five (5) aircraft during each of calendar years 2022 and 2023, and (iii) during the period from January 1, 2024 to July 31, 2024, American can remove the first 20 aircraft to the extent not otherwise removed in 2021 - 2023, and thereafter American has the right to remove the remaining 20 aircraft. American also has the right and option to withdraw a specified number of aircraft upon each occurrence of the following:\n\u25aa\nIf our CCF falls below certain levels for a specified period of time, American may withdraw one (1) aircraft;\n\u25aa\nIf our CD0 falls below certain levels for a specified period of time, American may withdraw one (1) aircraft;\n\u25aa\nIf we fail to satisfactorily complete established cabin interior program requirements by certain deadlines, American may withdraw one (1) aircraft; or\n\u25aa\nIf our block hour utilization falls below certain levels for a specified period of time, American may withdraw a specified number of aircraft.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, we entered into amendments to the American CPA. The amendments reflect the following:\n\u25aa\nThe addition of CRJ-900 aircraft to the American CPA (collectively, the Incremental Aircraft) in accordance with the following schedule: (i) three (3) aircraft, from January 5, 2021 to March 3, 2021, (ii) increasing to a total of five (5) aircraft, from March 4, 2021 to May 5, 2021, (iii) decreasing to a total of three (3) aircraft, from May 6, 2021 to June 2, 2021, and (iv) increasing to a total of five (5) aircraft, from June 3, 2021 to August 17, 2021.\n\u25aa\nA temporary reduction in certain rates for the period December 2020 through September 2021.\n\u25aa\nThe waiver of the operational performance metrics for the month of August 2021, and extension of the deadline for completing certain cabin interior and refurbishment requirements as defined in the American CPA to December 31, 2021.\n\u25aa\nIncreases to incentive and penalty compensation under the American CPA, effective beginning in October 2021.\nOn June 10, 2022, we amended our American CPA, pursuant to Amendment No. 8 thereto, to modify certain commercial terms thereunder. On June 20, 2022, we amended our American CPA, pursuant to Amendment No. 9 thereto, which amended and restated Schedule 1 (Covered Aircraft) to the American CPA and set forth certain equipment modification requirements with respect to Covered Aircraft added to such Schedule.\nFor the months of May and June 2022, we did not meet the CCF or CD0 minimum performance levels under the American CPA. The failure to meet these minimum performance levels for two (2) consecutive months under the terms of the American CPA gives American the right to remove two (2) additional aircraft from the CPA, one (1) aircraft for not meeting the CCF minimum performance level for two (2) consecutive months and one (1) aircraft for not meeting the CD0 minimum performance level for two (2) consecutive months. The Company's failure to meet the CCF or CD0 minimum performance levels for three (3) consecutive months gives American the right to terminate the CPA upon 90 days' notice and to provide a wind-down schedule.\nSubsequently on July 28, 2022, we amended our American CPA, pursuant to Amendment No. 10 thereto, to, among other things, (a) modify certain commercial terms, (b) provide that, commencing with calendar months after January 1, 2022, during any calendar month in which a Notification Shortfall (as defined in the CPA) occurs, bonuses and rebates will not be assessed, (c) reset the CCF and CD0 three (3)-month measurement periods for purposes of Americans termination rights under the CPA to commence August 2022, and (d) amend certain other amounts payable to us thereunder. In addition to the foregoing, our block hour utilization has fallen below required levels in prior months, which also gives American the right to withdraw certain aircraft, subject to complying with applicable notice requirements under the American CPA.\nFor the months of August, September, and October 2022, we did not meet the CD0 minimum performance levels under the American CPA. As noted above, the failure to meet such performance levels for two (2) consecutive months under the terms of the American CPA gives American the right to remove one (1) additional aircraft from the CPA for not meeting the CD0 minimum performance levels for two (2) consecutive months. The Companys failure to meet the CD0 minimum performance levels for three (3) consecutive months gives American the right to terminate the CPA upon 90 days notice and to provide a wind-down schedule. In December 2022, we entered into Amendment No.11 to our American CPA. See Note 18 - Subsequent Events for a discussion of Amendment No.11, which includes, among other things, disclosure regarding the wind down of our operations under the American CPA and the transition of such aircraft to the United CPA.\nUnited Capacity Purchase Agreement\nAs of September 30, 2022, we operated 20 E-175LL and 60 E-175 aircraft under a Second Amended and Restated Capacity Purchase Agreement with United dated November 4, 2020 (as amended, the United CPA). Under our United CPA, United owns 42 of the 60 E-175 and all of the E-175LL aircraft and leases them to us at nominal amounts. The E-175 aircraft owned by United and leased to us have terms expiring between 2024 and 2028, and the 18 E-175 aircraft owned by us have terms expiring in 2028. The E-175LL aircraft have terms expiring between 2032 and 2033.\nIn exchange for providing passenger flight services, we receive a fixed monthly minimum amount per aircraft under contract plus certain additional amounts based upon the number of flights and block hours flown and the results of passenger satisfaction surveys. United reimburses us for certain costs on an actual basis, including property tax per aircraft and passenger liability insurance. United also reimburses us on a pass-through basis for all costs related to heavy airframe and engine maintenance, landing gear, auxiliary power units (\"APUs\"), and component maintenance for the E-175 aircraft owned by United. Other expenses, including fuel and certain landing fees, are directly paid to suppliers by United.\nPursuant to the United CPA, we agreed to lease our CRJ-700 aircraft to another United Express service provider for a term of nine (9) years. We ceased operating our CRJ-700 fleet in February 2021 in connection with the transfer of those aircraft into a lease agreement, and as of June 30, 2022, have entered into agreements to lease 20 of our 20 CRJ-700 aircraft. During August of 2022, we committed to a formal plan to sell 18 of our 20 CRJ-700 aircraft and subsequently terminated the leases on the 18 CRJ-700 aircraft. As of September 30, 2022, we sold 10 of the 18 CRJ-700 aircraft. See Note 7 - Assets Held for Sale for further discussion of the CRJ-700 aircraft classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2022.\nOur United CPA is subject to termination rights prior to its expiration, including:\n\u25aa\nIf certain operational performance factors fall below a specified percentage for a specified time, subject to notice under certain circumstances;\n\u25aa\nIf we fail to perform the material covenants, agreements, terms or conditions of our United CPA or similar agreements with United, subject to 30 days' notice and cure rights;\n\u25aa\nIf either United or we become insolvent, file bankruptcy, or fail to pay debts when due, the non-defaulting party may terminate the agreement;\n\u25aa\nIf we merge with, or if control of us is acquired by another air carrier or a corporation directly or indirectly owning or controlling another air carrier;\n\u25aa\nUnited, subject to certain conditions, including the payment of certain costs tied to aircraft type, may terminate the agreement in its discretion, or remove E-175 aircraft from service, by giving us notice of 90 days or more;\n\u25aa\nIf United elects to terminate our United CPA in its entirety or permanently remove select aircraft from service, we are permitted to return any of the affected E-175 aircraft leased from United at no cost to us; and\n\u25aa\nCommencing five (5) years after the actual in-service date, United has the right to remove the E-175 aircraft from service by giving us notice of 90 days or more, subject to certain conditions, including the payment of certain wind-down expenses plus, if removed prior to the 10 year anniversary of the in-service date, certain accelerated margin payments.\nSee Note 18 - Subsequent Events for a discussion of the Amended and Restated United CPA, which includes among others, disclosure regarding the transition of the aircraft operated under the American CPA to be operated under the Amended and Restated United CPA.\nDHL Flight Services Agreement\nOn December 20, 2019, we entered into a Flight Services Agreement with DHL (the DHL FSA). Under the terms of the DHL FSA, we operate three (3) Boeing 737-400F aircraft to provide cargo air transportation services as of September 30, 2022. In exchange for providing cargo flight services, we receive a fee per block hour with a minimum block hour guarantee. We are eligible for a monthly performance bonus or subject to a monthly penalty based on timeliness and completion performance. Ground support expenses including fueling and airport fees are paid directly by DHL.\nUnder our DHL FSA, DHL leases two (2) Boeing 737-400F aircraft and subleases them to us at nominal amounts. DHL reimburses us on a pass-through basis for all costs related to heavy maintenance including C-checks, off-wing engine maintenance and overhauls including life limited parts (LLPs), landing gear overhauls and LLPs, thrust reverser overhauls, and APU overhauls and LLPs. Certain items such as fuel, de-icing fluids, landing fees, aircraft ground handling fees, en-route navigation fees, and custom fees are paid directly to suppliers by DHL or otherwise reimbursed if incurred by us. The third Boeing 737-400F aircraft is leased to us as an operating lease by a third party.\nThe DHL FSA expires five (5) years from the commencement date of the first aircraft placed into service, which was in October 2020. DHL has the option to extend the agreement with respect to one (1) or more aircraft for a period of one (1) year with 90 days advance written notice.\nOur DHL FSA is subject to following termination rights prior to its expiration:\n\u25aa\nIf either party fails to comply with the obligations, warranties, representations, or undertakings under the DHL FSA, subject to certain notice and cure rights;\n\u25aa\nIf either party is declared bankrupt or insolvent;\n\u25aa\nIf we are unable to legally operate the aircraft under the DHL FSA for a specified number of days;\n\u25aa\nAt any time after the first anniversary of the commencement date of the first aircraft placed in service with 90 days written notice.\n\u25aa\nIf we fail to comply with performance standards for three (3) consecutive measurement periods.\n\u25aa\nIf we are subject to a labor incident that materially and adversely affects our ability to perform services under the DHL FSA for a specified number of days;\n\u25aa\nUpon a change in control or ownership of the Company; and\n\u25aa\nDHL may terminate the agreement for a specific aircraft if it is subject to a total loss and the Company does not provide alternate services at our expense, or if the aircraft becomes unavailable for more than 30 days due to unscheduled maintenance.\nFor the months of April, May, and June 2022, we did not meet the CCF and CA minimum performance levels under the DHL FSA. The failure to meet the minimum performance levels for three (3) consecutive months under the terms of the DHL FSA gives DHL the right to terminate the FSA. Management has received a waiver arising out of the failure to meet the aforementioned CCF and CA performance levels.\nFor the months of July, August, and September 2022, we did not meet the CCF and CA minimum performance levels under the DHL FSA. The failure to meet the minimum performance levels for three (3) consecutive months under the terms\nof the DHL FSA gives DHL the right to terminate the FSA. Management has received a waiver arising out of the failure to meet the aforementioned CCF and CA performance levels.\n2.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned operating subsidiaries. Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to the authoritative United States generally accepted accounting principles as found in the Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") and Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\"). All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nReclassifications of certain immaterial prior period amounts have been made to conform to the current period presentation.\nThe Company is an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \"JOBS Act\") and may remain an emerging growth company until the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the IPO, subject to specified conditions. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the JOBS Act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards. The Company has elected to \"opt out\" of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nSegment Reporting\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing operating performance. In consideration of ASC 280, \"Segment Reporting,\" we are not organized around specific services or geographic regions. We currently operate in one service line providing scheduled flying services in accordance with our capacity purchase agreements and flight services agreement.\nWhile we operate under two (2) separate capacity purchase agreements and a flight services agreement, we do not manage our business based on any performance measure at the individual contract level. Additionally, our chief operating decision maker (CODM) uses consolidated financial information to evaluate our performance, which is the same basis on which he communicates our results and performance to our Board of Directors. Our CODM bases all significant decisions regarding the allocation of our resources on a consolidated basis. Based on the information described above and in accordance with the applicable literature, management has concluded that we are organized and operated as one operating and reportable segment.\nAll of our operating revenue in our 2022, 2021, and 2020 fiscal years was derived from operations associated with our American and United CPAs, DHL FSA, and from leases of aircraft to a third party. It is currently impractical to provide certain information on our revenue from our customers for each of our services and geographic information on our revenues and long-lived assets.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash primarily includes deposits in trust accounts to collateralize letters of credit and to fund workers' compensation claims, landing fees, and other business needs. Restricted cash is stated at cost, which approximates fair value.\nThe Company has an agreement with a financial institution for a $6.0 million letter of credit facility to issue letters of credit for landing fees, workers' compensation insurance, and other business needs. Pursuant to such agreement, $3.3 million and $3.4 million of outstanding letters of credit are required to be collateralized by amounts on deposit as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which are classified as restricted cash.\nExpendable Parts and Supplies\nExpendable parts and supplies are stated at cost, less an allowance for obsolescence. The Company provides an allowance for obsolescence for such parts and supplies over the useful life of its aircraft after considering the useful life of each aircraft fleet, the estimated cost of expendable parts expected to be on hand at the end of the useful life, and the estimated salvage value of the parts. This allowance for expendable parts account was $3.8 million and $3.2 million as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of manufacturer incentives, and depreciated over their estimated useful lives to their estimated salvage values, which are 20% for aircraft and rotable spare parts, using the straight-line method.\nEstimated useful lives of the various classifications of property and equipment are as follows:\nProperty and Equipment\nEstimated Useful Life\nBuildings\n30 years\nAircraft\n25 years from the manufacture date\nFlight equipment\n7-20 years\nEquipment\n5-9 years\nFurniture and fixtures\n3-5 years\nVehicles\n5 years\nRotable spare parts\nLife of the aircraft or term of the lease, whichever is less\nLeasehold improvements\nLife of the aircraft or term of the lease, whichever is less\nLong-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may be impaired. The Company records an impairment loss if (i) the undiscounted future cash flows are found to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, and (ii) the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. If an impairment loss has occurred, a charge is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value.\nTo determine whether impairments exist for aircraft and other related assets used in operations, we group assets at the capacity purchase agreement, flight services agreement, or fleet type level (i.e., the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows) and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity purchase or flight services agreement, block hours, maintenance events, labor costs and other relevant factors. If an asset group is impaired, the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the asset group's carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value. We estimate aircraft fair values using published sources, appraisals and bids received from third parties, as available. Due to the impacts of the pilot shortage and the pilot wage increase, we evaluated all asset groups during the quarter ended September 30, 2022 and determined that only the asset group associated with the CRJ-900 fleet operating under the American CPA was impaired as discussed in Note 8 - \"Balance Sheet Information\", because the future cash flows from the operation of other asset groups through the respective retirement dates exceeded the carrying value. The Company recognized impairment charges of $109.7 million, zero, and zero on property and equipment and other long-lived and ROU assets for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 respectively.\nAssets Held for Sale\nWe classify assets as held for sale when our management approves and commits to a formal plan of sale that is probable of being completed within one (1) year. Assets designated as held for sale are recorded at the lower of their current carrying value or their fair market value, less costs to sell, beginning in the period in which the assets meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale. See Note 7 - Assets Held for Sale for further discussion of our assets classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2022\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company accounts for assets and liabilities in accordance with accounting standards that define fair value and establish a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.\nAccounting standards include disclosure requirements relating to the fair values used for certain financial instruments and establish a fair value hierarchy. The hierarchy prioritizes valuation inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Each fair value measurement is reported in one of three levels:\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2 - Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.\nDebt Financing Costs\nDebt financing costs consist of payments made to issue debt related to the purchase of aircraft, flight equipment, and certain flight equipment maintenance costs. The Company defers the costs and amortizes them to interest expense over the term of the debt agreement. Debt financing costs related to a recognized debt liability are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet. Debt financing costs with no related recognized debt liability are presented as assets, with the current portion included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and the noncurrent portion included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.\nUnutilized Manufacturer Credits\nManufacturer credits received in connection with aircraft purchases that can be used for the future purchase of certain goods and services are recorded as a prepaid asset based on the value of the credits expected to be utilized, and the Company reduces the asset as the credits are utilized to fund such purchases. The current portion is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and the noncurrent portion is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.\nIntangible Assets\nCustomer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives. In accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, an intangible asset with a finite life that is being amortized is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may be impaired. The Company records an impairment loss if the undiscounted future cash flows are found to be less than the carrying amount of the asset and if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds fair value. If an impairment loss has occurred, a charge is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value. The Company recognized an impairment loss of $1.9 million, zero, and zero on intangible assets for the year ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 respectively.\nOther Assets\nOther noncurrent assets primarily consist of the non-current portion of lease incentives related to aircraft which Mesa leases to third parties and investments in equity securities.\nLease incentives represent amounts paid or payable by Mesa to the lessee and are amortized as a reduction of lease revenue over the term of the lease. The current portion of the lease incentive assets is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and the non-current portion is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.\nInvestments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values are adjusted to reflect the market value of the investments each reporting period, with corresponding gains and losses reflected in the statement of operations. Investments in equity securities without readily determinable values are measured at cost less impairment, if any, and are adjusted when there are observable prices of similar or identical investments from the same issuer.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in future years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company records deferred tax assets for the value of benefits expected to be realized from the utilization of state and federal net operating loss carryforwards. The Company periodically reviews these assets to determine the likelihood of realization. To the extent the Company believes some portion of the benefit may not be realizable based on the available sources of income, an estimate of the unrealized position is made, and a valuation allowance is recorded. The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return.\nOther Noncurrent Liabilities\nOther noncurrent liabilities primarily consist of the non-current portion of lease incentive obligations and deposits related to the aircraft which Mesa leases to third parties and vendor credit liabilities for future purchases of electric aircraft.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue when the service is provided under its capacity purchase agreements and flight services agreement. Under these agreements, the Companys major partners generally pay a fixed monthly minimum amount per aircraft, plus certain additional amounts based upon the number of departures and block hours or flight hours flown. The agreements also include reimbursement of certain direct costs incurred by the Company in performing flight services. These costs, known as \"pass-through costs,\" may include passenger and hull insurance as well as aircraft property taxes. Additionally, for the E-175 aircraft owned by United, United reimburses the Company for heavy airframe and engine maintenance, landing gear maintenance, APU maintenance, and component maintenance. The Company also receives compensation under its agreements for heavy maintenance expenses at a fixed hourly rate or per aircraft rate for all aircraft in scheduled service other than the E-175 aircraft owned by United. The contracts also include a profit margin on certain reimbursable costs, as well as incentives and penalties based on certain operational benchmarks. The Company is eligible to receive incentive compensation upon the achievement of certain performance criteria defined in the agreements. At the end of each period during the term of an agreement, the Company calculates the incentives or penalties achieved during that period and recognizes revenue attributable to the agreement during the period accordingly, subject to the variable constraint guidance in accordance ASC 606. All revenue recognized under these contracts is presented as the gross amount billed to the major partners. See Note 3 - Contract Revenue and Pass-through and Other Revenue for further information.\nThe Company has committed to perform various activities that can be generally classified into in-flight services and maintenance services. When evaluating these services, the Company determined that the nature of its promise is to provide a single integrated service, flight services, because its contracts require integration and assumption of risk associated with both services to effectively deliver and provide the flights as scheduled over the contract term. Therefore, the in-flight services and maintenance services are inputs to that combined integrated flight service. Both the services occur over the term of the agreement and the performance of maintenance services significantly effects the utility of the in-flight services. The Company's individual flights flown under the capacity purchase agreements and flight services agreement are deemed to be distinct and the flight service promised in the agreements represents a series of services that should be accounted for as a single performance obligation. This single performance obligation is satisfied over time as the flights are completed. Therefore, revenue is recognized when each flight is completed.\nIn allocating the transaction price, variable payments (i.e., billings based on departures and block hours or flight hours flown, pass-through costs, etc.) that relate specifically to the Company's efforts in performing flight services are recognized in the period in which the individual flight is completed. The Company has concluded that allocating the variability directly to the individual flights results in an overall allocation meeting the objectives in ASC 606. This results in a pattern of revenue recognition that follows the variable amounts billed from the Company to its customers.\nA portion of the Company's compensation under its capacity purchase agreements with American and United is designed to reimburse the Company for certain aircraft ownership costs. Such costs include aircraft principal and interest debt service costs, aircraft depreciation, and interest expense or aircraft lease expense costs while the aircraft is under contract. The Company has concluded that a component of its revenue under these agreements is deemed to be lease revenue, as such agreements identify the \"right of use\" of a specific type and number of aircraft over a stated period-of-time. The lease revenue associated with the Company's capacity purchase agreements is accounted for as an operating lease and is reflected as contract revenue on the Company's consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income.\nThe Company recognized $158.4 million, $170.2 million and $208.9 million of lease revenue for the year ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The Company has not separately stated aircraft rental income and aircraft rental expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income because the use of the aircraft is not a separate activity of the total service provided under our capacity purchase agreements.\nThe Company's capacity purchase agreements and flight services agreement are renewable periodically and contain provisions pursuant to which the parties could terminate their respective agreements, or withdraw aircraft under their respective agreements, subject to certain conditions as described in Note 1. The agreements also contain terms with respect to covered aircraft, services provided, and compensation as described in Note 1. The agreements are amended from time to time to change, add, or delete terms of the agreements.\nThe Company's revenues could be impacted by a number of factors, including amendment or termination of its agreements with its major partners, contract modifications resulting from contract renegotiations, its ability to earn incentive payments contemplated under applicable agreements, and settlement of reimbursement disputes with the Company's major partners. In the event contracted rates are not finalized at a quarterly or annual financial statement date, the Company evaluates the enforceability of its contractual terms and when it has an enforceable right, it estimates the amount the Company expects to be entitled to that is subject to the variable constraint guidance within ASC 606.\nThe Company's agreements contain an option that allows its major partners to assume the contractual responsibility for procuring and providing the fuel necessary to operate the flights that it operates for them. All of the Company's major partners have exercised this option. Accordingly, the Company does not record an expense or revenue for fuel and related fueling costs for flying under its capacity purchase agreements or flight services agreement. In addition, the Company's major partners also provide, at no cost to the Company, certain ground handling and customer service functions, as well as airport-related facilities and gates at their hubs and other cities. Services and facilities provided by the Company's major partners at no cost are presented net in its consolidated financial statements; hence, no amounts are recorded as revenue or operating expense for these items.\nContract Liabilities\nContract liabilities consist of deferred credits representing upfront payments received from major partners related to aircraft modifications associated with capacity purchase agreements and pilot training. The deferred credits are recognized over time depicting the pattern of transfer of the related services over the term of the capacity purchase agreements.\nCurrent and non-current deferred credits are recorded to other accrued expenses and non-current deferred credits in the consolidated balance sheets, respectively. The Company's total current and non-current deferred credit balances at September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 were $3.9 million and $4.8 million, respectively. The Company recognized $0.9 million, $2.4 million and $3.7 million of the deferred credits within contract revenue in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income during the year ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nContract Assets\nThe Company recognizes assets from the incremental costs incurred to obtain contracts with major partners including aircraft painting, aircraft reconfiguration, and flight service personnel training costs. These costs are amortized based on the pattern of transfer of the services in relation to flight hours over the term of the contract. Contract assets are recorded as other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company's contract assets balance at September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 was zero and zero, respectively. Contract cost amortization was zero, $2.0 million and $1.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nMaintenance Expense\nThe Company operates under an FAA approved continuous inspection and maintenance program. The cost of non-major scheduled inspections and repairs and routine maintenance costs for all aircraft and engines are charged to maintenance expense as incurred.\nThe Company accounts for heavy maintenance and major overhaul costs on its owned E-175 fleet under the deferral method whereby the cost of heavy maintenance and major overhaul is deferred and amortized until the earlier of the end of the useful life of the related asset or the next scheduled heavy maintenance event. Amortization of heavy maintenance and major overhaul costs charged to depreciation and amortization expense was $1.9 million, $0.4 million, and zero for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. At September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, the Company had a deferred heavy maintenance balance, net of accumulated amortization, of $9.7 million and $3.5 million, respectively. The Company accounts for heavy maintenance and major overhaul costs for all other fleets under the direct expense method whereby costs are expensed to maintenance expense as incurred, except for certain maintenance contracts where labor and materials price risks have been transferred to the service provider and require payment on a utilization basis, such as flight hours. Costs incurred for maintenance and repair for utilization maintenance contracts where labor and materials price risks have been transferred to the service provider are charged to maintenance expense based on contractual payment terms. Our maintenance policy is determined by fleet when major maintenance is incurred.\nUnder the Company's aircraft operating lease agreements and FAA operating regulations, it is obligated to perform all required maintenance activities on its fleet, including component repairs, scheduled airframe checks and major engine restoration events. The Company estimates the timing of the next major maintenance event based on assumptions including estimated usage, FAA-mandated maintenance intervals, and average removal times as recommended by the manufacturer. The timing and the cost of maintenance are based on estimates, which can be impacted by changes in utilization of its aircraft, changes in government regulations and suggested manufacturer maintenance intervals. Major maintenance events consist of overhauls to major components.\nEngine overhaul expense totaled $23.6 million, $31.4 million and $40.5 million for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, of which $21.7 million, $16.8 million, and $7.0 million, respectively, was pass-through expense. Airframe check expense totaled $22.1 million, $51.1 million and $23.5 million for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, of which $3.2 million, $20.5 million, and $7.2 million, respectively, was pass-through expense.\nPursuant to the United CPA, United reimburses the Company for heavy maintenance on certain E-175 aircraft. Those reimbursements are included in pass-through and other revenue. See Note 1 - \"Organization and Operations\" for further information.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. As a lessee, we have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components and have elected to account for such components as a single lease component. Our operating lease activities are recorded in operating lease right-of-use assets, current maturities of operating leases, and noncurrent operating lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are reflected in property and equipment, net, current portion of long-term debt and finance leases, and long-term debt and finance leases, excluding current portion in the consolidated balance sheets.\nRight-of-use (ROU) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Variable lease payments are not included in the calculation of the right-of-use assets and lease liability due to uncertainty of the payment amount and are recorded as lease expense in the period incurred. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We use the implicit rate when readily determinable. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Operating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, while finance leases result in a front-loaded expense pattern.\nTo determine whether impairments exist for aircraft and other related assets used in operations, we group assets, including ROU assets, at the capacity purchase agreement, flight services agreement, or fleet type level (i.e., the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows) and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity purchase or flight services agreement, block hours, maintenance events, labor costs and other relevant factors. Due to the impacts of the pilot shortage and the pilot wage increase, we evaluated all asset groups during the quarter ended September 30, 2022 and determined that the asset group associated with the CRJ-900 fleet operating under the American CPA, discussed in Note 8 - Balance Sheet Information, required impairment. This resulted in an impairment loss of $15.2 million to the leased aircraft in the asset group for the CRJ-900 fleet operating for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, which was recorded in asset impairment on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income.\nAs a lessee, we have elected a short-term lease practical expedient on all classes of underlying assets, permitting us to not apply the recognition requirements of this standard to leases with terms of 12 months or less.\nOur capacity purchase agreements identify the \"right of use\" of a specific type and number of aircraft over a stated period-of-time. A portion of the compensation under our capacity purchase agreements are designed to reimburse the Company, as lessor, for certain aircraft ownership costs of these aircraft. We account for the non-lease component under ASC 606 and account for the lease component under ASC 842. We allocate the consideration in the contract between the lease and non-lease components based on their stated contract prices, which is based on a cost basis approach representing our estimate of the stand-alone selling prices.\nAs discussed in Note 1, we lease, at nominal rates, certain aircraft from United and DHL under our United CPA and DHL FSA, which are excluded from operating lease assets and liabilities as they do not represent embedded leases under ASC 842. Other than nominal leases with our major partners, approximately 11% of our aircraft are leased from third parties. All of our aircraft leases have been classified as operating leases, which results in rental payments being charged to expense over the term of the related leases. In the event that we or one of our major partners decide to exit an activity involving leased aircraft, losses may be incurred. In the event that we exit an activity that results in exit losses, these losses are accrued as each aircraft is removed from operations for early termination penalties, lease settle up and other charges. Additionally, any remaining ROU assets and lease liabilities will be written off.\nThe majority of the Company's leased aircraft are leased through trusts that have a sole purpose to purchase, finance, and lease these aircraft to the Company; therefore, they meet the criteria of a variable interest entity. However, since these are single-owner trusts in which the Company does not participate, the Company is not at risk for losses and is not considered the primary beneficiary. Management believes that the Company's maximum exposure under these leases is the remaining lease payments.\n3.\nContract Revenue and Pass-through and Other Revenue\nThe Company recognizes contract revenue when the service is provided under its capacity purchase agreements and flight services agreement. Under the capacity purchase agreements and flight services agreement, our major partners generally pay for each departure, flight hour (measured from takeoff to landing, excluding taxi time) or block hour (measured from takeoff to landing, including taxi time) incurred, and an amount per aircraft in service each month with additional incentives based on flight completion, on-time performance, and other operating metrics. The Companys performance obligation is met when each flight is completed, and revenue is recognized and reflected in contract revenue.\nThe Companys contract revenue also includes temporary rate reductions during fiscal year 2021 under our capacity purchase agreements. The basis for the reductions is temporary improvements in our cost structure being passed on to our major partners, primarily from lower labor costs due to the grants received under the Payroll Support Program and its extensions through the year ended September 30, 2021. The Companys contract revenue for fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 does not include any rate reductions.\nThe Company recognizes pass-through revenue when the service is provided under its capacity purchase agreements and flight services agreement. Pass-through revenue represents reimbursements for certain direct expenses incurred including passenger liability and hull insurance, property taxes, other direct costs defined within the agreements, and major maintenance on aircraft leased at nominal rates. The Companys performance obligation is met when each flight is completed or as the maintenance services are performed, and revenue is recognized and reflected in pass-through and other revenue.\nThe Company records deferred revenue when cash payments are received or are due from our major partners in advance of the Companys performance, including amounts that are refundable. The Company deferred $10.4 million and $10.7 million of revenue during the years ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively, which was billed to and paid by our major partners. Deferred revenue is recognized as flights are completed over the remaining contract term.\nThe deferred revenue balance as of September 30, 2022 represents our aggregate remaining performance obligations that will be recognized as revenue over the period in which the performance obligations are satisfied, and is expected to be recognized as revenue as follows (in thousands):\nPeriods Ending\nSeptember 30,\nTotal Revenue\n$\n2,553\n10,065\n4,792\n3,679\nThereafter\n2,593\nTotal\n$\n24,067\nA portion of the Company's compensation under its capacity purchase agreements with American and United is designed to reimburse the Company for certain aircraft ownership costs. Such costs include aircraft principal and interest debt service costs, aircraft depreciation, and interest expense or aircraft lease expense costs while the aircraft is under contract. The Company has concluded that a component of its revenue under these agreements is deemed to be lease revenue, as such agreements identify the \"right of use\" of a specific type and number of aircraft over a stated period-of-time. We account for the non-lease component under ASC 606 and account for the lease component under ASC 842. We allocate the consideration in the contract between the lease and non-lease components based on their stated contract prices, which is based on a cost basis approach representing our estimate of the stand-alone selling prices.\nThe lease revenue associated with the Company's capacity purchase agreements is accounted for as an operating lease and is reflected as contract revenue on the Company's consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. The Company recognized $158.4 million, $170.2 million, and $208.9 million of lease revenue for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The Company has not separately stated aircraft rental income and aircraft rental expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income because the use of the aircraft is not a separate activity from the total service provided under our capacity purchase agreements.\nHistorically, the Company entered into lease agreements with GoJet Airlines LLC (GoJet) to lease CRJ-700 aircraft. The lease agreements were accounted for as operating leases and had a term of nine (9) years beginning on the delivery date of each aircraft. Under the lease agreements, GoJet paid fixed monthly rent per aircraft and variable lease payments for supplemental rent based on monthly aircraft utilization at fixed rates. Supplemental rent payments were subject to reimbursement following GoJets completion of qualifying maintenance events defined in the agreements. Lease revenue for fixed monthly rent payments were recognized on a straight-line basis within contract revenue. Lease revenue for supplemental rent was deferred and recognized within contract revenue when it was probable that amounts received will not be reimbursed for future qualifying maintenance events over the lease term.\nThe Company mitigated the residual asset risks through supplemental rent payments and by leasing aircraft and engine types that can be operated by the Company in the event of a default. Additionally, the operating leases included specified lease return condition requirements and the Company maintains inspection rights under the leases. Lease incentive obligations for reimbursements of certain aircraft maintenance costs are recognized as lease incentive assets and were amortized on a straight-line basis and recognized as a reduction to lease revenue over the lease term.\nDuring August of 2022, the Company classified 18 CRJ-700 aircraft as assets held for sale (see Note 7) and terminated all lease agreements with GoJet. As a result of the lease termination, the Company recognized a loss from immediately derecognizing lease incentive assets of $3.2 million. This loss is recorded in operating expense. Prior to the lease termination, lease revenue recognized under the GoJet agreements, net of amortization of the lease incentive assets, was $30.0 million, $9.5 million, and zero for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 respectively.\n4.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) (ASU 2020-04). This ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for a limited period of time for accounting for contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or other reference rates expected to be discontinued. Optional expedients can be applied from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. We are currently evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued new guidance to expand the scope of financial assets that can be included in a closed portfolio hedged using the portfolio layer method to allow consistent accounting for similar hedges. The expanded scope permits the application of the same portfolio hedging method to both prepayable and non-prepayable financial assets. The standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued new guidance to clarify the fair value measurement guidance for equity securities subject to contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of an equity security. Further, the guidance introduces new disclosure requirements for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions that are measured at fair value. The standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.\n5.Concentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially expose the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents that are primarily held by financial institutions in the United States and accounts receivable. Amounts on deposit with a financial institution may at times exceed federally insured limits. The Company maintains its cash accounts with high credit quality financial institutions and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists with respect to the financial institutions. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had $3.3 million in restricted cash. We have an agreement with a financial institution for a letter of credit facility and to issue letters of credit for particular airport authorities, worker's compensation insurance, property and casualty insurance and other business needs as required in certain lease agreements. Pursuant to the terms of this agreement, $3.3 million and $3.4 million of outstanding letters of credit are required to be collateralized by amounts on deposit as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which are classified as restricted cash.\nSignificant customers are those which represent more than 10% of the Companys total revenue or net accounts receivable balance at each respective balance sheet date. At September 30, 2022, the Company had capacity purchase agreements with American and United and a flight services agreement with DHL. Substantially all of the Company's consolidated revenue for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 and accounts receivable at the end of September 30, 2022 and 2021 was derived from these agreements. In certain cases, the terms of these agreements are not aligned with the lease obligations on the aircraft performing services under such agreements.\nAmounts billed by the Company under these agreements are subject to the Company's interpretation of the applicable agreement and are subject to audit by the Company's major partners. Periodically, the Company's major partners dispute amounts billed and pay amounts less than the amount billed. Ultimate collection of the remaining amounts not only depends upon the Company prevailing under the applicable audit, but also upon the financial well-being of the major partner. As such, the Company reviews amounts due based on historical collection trends, the financial condition of major partners and current external market factors and records a reserve for amounts estimated to be uncollectible. The allowance for doubtful accounts was not material at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. If the Company's ability to collect these receivables and the financial viability of our major partners is materially different than estimated, the Company's estimate of the allowance could be materially impacted.\nAmerican accounted for approximately 45%, 45% and 52% of the Company's total revenue for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. United accounted for approximately 48%, 52% and 48% of the Company's total revenue for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. A termination of either the American or the United capacity purchase agreement would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n6.\nIntangible Assets\nThe Company includes its intangible assets of customer relationship in the asset group associated with the CRJ-900 fleet operating under the American CPA and monitors for any indicators of impairment of the asset group. When certain conditions or changes in the economic situation exist, the asset group may be impaired if the carrying amount of the assets is not recoverable and that carrying amount exceeds the asset groups fair value. Due to the impacts of the pilot shortage and the pilot wage increase, we evaluated all asset groups during the quarter ended September 30, 2022 and determined that the asset group for the CRJ-900 fleet operating under the American CPA was impaired. As a result, the Company recognized an impairment loss of $1.9 million on the customer relationship related to the CRJ-900 fleet operating under the American CPA during the quarter ended September 30, 2022, which was recorded in asset impairment on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. The Company did not record any impairment losses related to its intangible assets during the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020.\nInformation about the intangible assets of the Company at September 30, 2022 and 2021, is as follows (in thousands):\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nCustomer relationship\n$\n43,800\n$\n43,800\nAccumulated amortization\n(38,029\n)\n(37,008\n)\nImpairment\n(1,929\n)\n-\nNet carrying value\n$\n3,842\n$\n6,792\nTotal amortization expense recognized was approximately $1.0 million, $1.2 million, and $1.5 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020. The Companys intangible assets have a remaining amortization period\nof three (3) years. The Company expects to record amortization expense of $1.3 million, $1.3 million, and $1.2 million for fiscal years 2023, 2024, and 2025, respectively.\n7. Assets Held for Sale\nDuring 2022, our management committed to a formal plan to sell certain of our CRJ-900, CRJ-200, and CRJ-700 aircraft. The aircraft are expected to be disposed of via sale by December 31, 2022. Accordingly, we determined the aircraft met the criteria to be classified as assets held for sale and have separately presented them in our consolidated balance sheet at the lower of their current carrying value or their fair market value less costs to sell. The fair values are based upon observable and unobservable inputs, including recent purchase offers and market trends and conditions. The assumptions used to determine the fair value of our assets held for sale are subject to inherent uncertainty and could produce a wide range of outcomes which we will continue to monitor in future periods as new information becomes available. Prior to the ultimate sale of the assets, subsequent changes in our estimate of the fair value of our assets held for sale will be recorded as a gain or loss with a corresponding adjustment to the assets carrying value. In connection with the classification of these assets as held for sale, we recorded impairment losses of $62.0 million, which are reflected within impairment of assets held for sale in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income (loss).\nIn September 2022, the Company completed the sale of 10 CRJ-700 aircraft for $50.0 million in cash proceeds. The disposed aircraft had a held for sale value of $45.3 million and the Company recognized $4.7 million of gain on sale, which is reflected within gain on sale of aircraft on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company has 11 CRJ-900 aircraft, eight (8) CRJ-700 aircraft, and one (1) CRJ-200 aircraft that are classified as assets held for sale with a net book value of $73.0 million, which is reflected within assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet.\n8.\nBalance Sheet Information\nCertain significant amounts included in the Company's consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, consisted of the following (in thousands):\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nExpendable parts and supplies, net:\nExpendable parts and supplies\n$\n31,913\n$\n29,297\nLess: obsolescence and other\n(5,198\n)\n(4,830\n)\n$\n26,715\n$\n24,467\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets:\nPrepaid aviation insurance\n$\n2,618\n$\n2,171\nPrepaid vendors\n1,310\nPrepaid other insurance\n1,268\n1,323\nLease Incentives\n1,445\nOther\n1,068\n1,053\n$\n6,616\n$\n6,885\nProperty and equipment, net:\nAircraft and other flight equipment\nsubstantially pledged\n$\n1,260,143\n$\n1,611,544\nOther equipment\n5,577\n4,934\nLeasehold improvements\n2,776\n2,776\nVehicles\n1,184\nBuilding\nFurniture and fixtures\nTotal property and equipment\n1,270,563\n1,621,437\nLess: accumulated depreciation\n(405,309\n)\n(469,546\n)\n$\n865,254\n$\n1,151,891\nOther assets:\nInvestments in equity securities\n$\n15,178\n$\n25,149\nLease incentives\n1,097\n10,957\nOther\n$\n16,290\n$\n36,121\nOther accrued expenses:\nAccrued property taxes\n$\n5,866\n$\n8,783\nAccrued interest\n2,882\n2,565\nAccrued vacation\n4,746\n5,936\nAccrued lodging\n3,795\n3,380\nAccrued maintenance\n1,453\n1,580\nAccrued liability on government payroll program\n2,967\n2,775\nAccrued simulator costs\n1,045\nAccrued employee benefits\n1,679\nAccrued fleet operating expense\n1,606\nShort term lease incentive liability\n3,318\nOther\n2,864\n3,096\n$\n29,000\n$\n33,657\nOther noncurrent liabilities:\nWarrant liabilities\n$\n25,225\n$\n21,964\nLease incentive obligations\n1,050\n6,358\nLong term employee benefits\n1,123\n1,447\nLong term liability on government payroll program\n-\n2,775\nOther\n1,821\n2,047\n$\n29,219\n$\n34,591\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nThe Company monitors for any indicators of impairment of the long-lived fixed assets. When certain conditions or changes in the economic situation exist, the assets may be impaired and the carrying amount of the assets exceed its fair value. The assets are then tested for recoverability of carrying amount. The Company records impairment charges on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired, the undiscounted net cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets, and the net book value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair value.\nWe group assets at the capacity purchase agreement, flight services agreement, and fleet-type level (i.e., the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows). If impairment indicators exist with respect to any of the asset groups, we estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity purchase or flight services agreement, block hours, maintenance events, labor costs and other relevant factors.\nDue to the impacts of the pilot shortage and the pilot wage increase, the Company assessed whether any impairment of its long-lived assets existed for all asset groups during the quarter ended September 30, 2022. The Company has determined that impairment charges were deemed necessary only for the asset group associated with the CRJ-900 fleet operating under the American CPA because the future cash flows from the operation of other asset groups through the respective retirement dates exceeded the carrying value. The asset group associated with the CRJ-900 fleet includes owned aircraft, leased aircraft, intangible assets of customer relationship, and other relevant long-lived assets. The fair values of assets within the CRJ-900 fleet were calculated using Level 3 fair value inputs based primarily upon recent market transactions, appraisals, and third-party bids, which were corroborated with published pricing guides and our assessment of existing market conditions based on industry knowledge. For the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company recognized a total impairment loss of $109.7 million related to the asset group associate with the CRJ-900 fleet, of which $92.6 million was related to property and equipment, $15.2 million was related to operating lease right-of-use assets, and $1.9 million was related to intangible asset of customer relationship. These impairment charges were recorded in asset impairment on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. The Company did not record any impairment losses related to its long-lived assets during the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020.\nThe Companys assumptions about future conditions important to its assessment of potential impairment of its long-lived assets, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to its business, are subject to uncertainty, and the Company will continue to monitor these conditions in future periods as new information becomes available, and will update its analyses accordingly.\nDepreciation Expense on Property and Equipment\nDepreciation expense on property and equipment totaled $80.5 million, $81.2 million and $80.8 million for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nOther Assets\nIn connection with a negotiated forward purchase contract for electrically-powered vertical takeoff and landing aircraft (eVTOL aircraft) executed in February 2021, we obtained equity warrant assets giving us the right to acquire a number shares of common stock in Archer Aviation, Inc. (Archer), which at the time of our initial investment was a private, venture-backed company. As the initial investment in Archer did not have a readily determinable fair value, we accounted for this investment using the measurement alternative under ASC 321 and measured the investments at cost less impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments from the same issuer. We estimated the initial equity warrant asset value to be $16.4 million based on publicly available information as of the grant date. In September 2021, the merger between Archer and a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) was completed, resulting in a readily determinable fair value of our investments in Archer. Accordingly, gains and losses associated with changes in the fair value of our investments in Archer are measured in earnings, in accordance with ASC 321.\nThe initial grant date value of the warrants, $16.4 million, was recognized as a vendor credit liability within other noncurrent liabilities. The liability related to the warrant assets will be settled in the future, as a reduction of the acquisition date value of the eVTOL aircraft contemplated in the related aircraft purchase agreement.\nIn connection with closing of the merger between Archer and the SPAC described above, in September 2021, we purchased 500,000 Class A common shares in Archer for $5.0 million, and obtained an additional warrant to purchase shares of Archer with a total grant date value of $5.6 million. The initial value of the warrants was recognized as a vendor credit liability within other noncurrent liabilities, and will be settled in the future, as a reduction of the acquisition date value of the eVTOL aircraft contemplated in the related aircraft purchase agreement. Because these investments have readily\ndeterminable fair values, gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of the investments are reflected in earnings, in accordance with ASC 321. All of our vested warrants have been exercised into shares of Archer common stock.\nLosses on our investments in Archer totaled $13.7 million and $6.8 million during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, and are reflected in loss on investments, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income.\nThe fair values of the Companys investments in Archer are Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy as the values are determined using quoted prices for the equity securities.\nIn connection with a negotiated forward purchase contract for fully electric aircraft executed in July 2021, we obtained $5.0 million of preferred stock in Heart Aerospace Incorporated (Heart), a privately held company. Our investment in Heart does not have a readily determinable fair value, so we account for the investment using the measurement alternative under ASC 321 and measure the investment at initial cost less impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments from the same issuer. We consider a range of factors when adjusting the fair value of these investments, including, but not limited to, the term and nature of the investment, local market conditions, values for comparable securities, current and projected operating performance, financing transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the investment, or other features that indicate a change to fair value is warranted. Any changes in fair value from the initial cost of the investment in preferred stock are recognized as increases or decreases on our balance sheet and as net gains or losses on investments in equity securities, in other income (expense), net. The initial investment in preferred stock was measured at cost of $5.0 million. There were no identical or similar transactions during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, and as such, no adjustments to the initial cost of the equity investment resulting from observable price changes have been recorded at September 30, 2022.\nIn connection with a negotiated forward purchase contract for hybrid-electric vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft executed in February 2022, we obtained a warrant giving us the right to acquire a number of shares of common stock in the privately-held manufacturer of the VTOL aircraft. These investments do not have a readily determinable fair value, so we account for them using the measurement alternative under ASC 321 and measure the investments at cost less impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments from the same issuer. We consider a range of factors when adjusting the fair value of these investments, including, but not limited to, the term and nature of the investment, local market conditions, values for comparable securities, current and projected operating performance, financing transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the investment or other features that indicate a discount to fair value is warranted. Any changes in fair value from the grant date value of the warrant assets will be recognized as increases or decreases to the investment on our balance sheet and as net gains or losses on investments equity securities. We estimated the initial warrant asset value to be $3.2 million based on prices of similar investments in the same issuer. The grant date value of the warrants, $3.2 million, was recognized as a vendor credit liability within other noncurrent liabilities. The liability related to the warrant assets will be settled in the future, as a reduction of the acquisition date value of the VTOL aircraft contemplated in the related forward purchase agreement.\nTotal net losses on our investments in equity securities totaled $13.7 million during the year ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and are reflected in loss on investments, net in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. As of September 30, 2022, the aggregate carrying amount of our investments in equity securities was $15.2 million, and the carrying amount of our investments without readily determinable fair values was $9.0 million.\n9.\nFair Value Measurements\nOther than our assets held for sale, asset group associated with the CRJ-900 fleet, and investments in equity securities described in Notes 7 and 8, respectively, we did not measure any of our assets or liabilities at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nThe carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, and accounts payable included on the consolidated balance sheets approximated fair value at September 30, 2022 and 2021 because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments.\nThe Company's debt agreements are not traded on an active market. The Company has determined the estimated fair value of its debt to be Level 3, as certain inputs used to determine the fair value of these agreements are unobservable and, therefore, could be sensitive to changes in inputs. The Company utilizes the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of Level 3 debt.\nThe carrying value and estimated fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including current maturities, were as follows (in millions):\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\nCarrying\nFair\nCarrying\nFair\nValue\nValue\nValue\nValue\nLong-term debt, including current maturities(1)\n$\n615.3\n$\n541.7\n$\n670.3\n$\n676.8\n(1)\nCurrent and prior period long-term debts' carrying and fair values exclude net debt issuance costs.\n10.\nLong-Term Debt, Finance Leases, and Other Borrowings\nLong-term debt as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, consisted of the following (in thousands):\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nSenior and subordinated notes payable to secured parties, due in monthly installments, interest based on LIBOR plus interest spread at 2.71% through 2027, collateralized by the underlying aircraft\n$\n73,850\n$\n86,551\nNotes payable to secured parties, due in semi-annual installments, interest based on LIBOR plus interest spread at 4.75% to 6.25% through 2028, collateralized by the underlying aircraft\n131,010\n152,100\nNotes payable to secured parties, due in quarterly installments, interest based on LIBOR plus interest at spread 2.20% to 2.32% for senior note & 4.50% for subordinated note through 2028, collateralized by the underlying aircraft\n106,865\n122,762\nOther obligations due to financial institution, monthly and/or quarterly interest due from 2022 through 2031, collateralized by the underlying equipment\n18,038\n4,581\nNotes payable to financial institution, due in monthly installments, interest based on LIBOR plus interest spread at 3.10% through 2024, collateralized by the underlying equipment\n26,758\n45,559\nNotes payable to financial institution, due in monthly installments, plus interest spread at 5.00% through 2022, collateralized by the underlying aircraft\n-\n30,625\nNotes payable to financial institution, due in monthly installments, plus interest spread at 5.00% through 2023, secured by flight equipment\n2,000\n4,000\nRevolving credit facility, monthly interest based on LIBOR plus interest spread at 3.75% through 2022\n15,630\n22,930\nNotes payable to financial institution, quarterly interest based on LIBOR plus interest spread at 3.50% through 2027\n204,947\n201,227\nNotes payable to financial institution, due in monthly installments, interest based on LIBOR plus interest spread at 4.24%, through 2027, collateralized by the underlying equipment\n36,212\n-\nGross long-term debt, including current maturities\n$\n615,310\n$\n670,335\nLess unamortized debt issuance costs\n(8,303\n)\n(9,295\n)\nLess notes payable warrants\n(7,272\n)\n(9,630\n)\nNet long-term debt, including current maturities\n$\n599,735\n$\n651,410\nLess current portion, net of unamortized debt issuance costs\n(97,218\n)\n(111,710\n)\nNet long-term debt\n$\n502,517\n$\n539,700\nPrincipal maturities of long-term debt as of September 30, 2022, and for each of the next five (5) years are as follows (in thousands):\nTotal Principal\nPeriods Ending September 30,\nAmount\n$\n99,102\n73,374\n64,512\n271,824\n63,958\nThereafter\n42,540\n$\n615,310\nThe net book value of collateralized aircraft and equipment as of September 30, 2022 was $856.9. million.\nEnhanced Equipment Trust Certificate (\"EETC\")\nIn December 2015, an Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificate (\"EETC\") pass-through trust was created to issue pass-through certificates to obtain financing for new E-175 aircraft. At September 30, 2022, Mesa has $131.0 million of equipment notes outstanding issued under the EETC financing included in long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets. The structure of the EETC financing consists of a pass-through trust created by Mesa to issue pass-through certificates, which represent fractional undivided interests in the pass-through trust and are not obligations of Mesa.\nThe proceeds of the issuance of the pass-through certificates were used to purchase equipment notes which were issued by Mesa and secured by its aircraft. The payment obligations under the equipment notes are those of Mesa. Proceeds received from the sale of pass-through certificates were initially held by a depositary in escrow for the benefit of the certificate holders until Mesa issued equipment notes to the trust, which purchased such notes with a portion of the escrowed funds.\nMesa evaluated whether the pass-through trust formed for its EETC financing is a variable interest entity (\"VIE\") and required to be consolidated. The pass-through trust was determined to be a VIE; however, the Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the pass-through trust, and therefore, has not consolidated the pass-through trust with its financial statements.\nCIT Revolving Credit Facility\nOn June 30, 2022, we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement by and among Mesa Airlines and Mesa Air Group Airline Inventory Management, L.L.C., as borrowers, Mesa Air Group, as a Guarantor, the other guarantors party thereto from time to time, CIT Bank, as Administrative Agent, and the other lenders party thereto, which was effective as of June 30, 2022 and extended the maturity date of the facility by three (3) months to December 31, 2022.\nAs of September 30, 2022, $15.6 million of the draw loan remained outstanding. Future borrowings, if any, under this facility are subject to, among other things, the Company having sufficient unencumbered assets to meet the borrowing base requirements under the facility.\nOur CIT revolving credit facility includes a minimum interest and rental coverage ratio covenant. In March and April 2022, we entered into amendments to the CIT revolving credit facility which lowered the minimum interest and rental coverage ratio covenant for the year September 30, 2022. As a result, we are in compliance with this covenant.\nLoan Agreement with the United States Department of the Treasury\nOn October 30, 2020, the Company entered into a Loan and Guarantee Agreement with U.S. Department of the Treasury (the U.S. Treasury) for a secured loan facility of up to $200.0 million that matures in October 2025 (the Treasury Loan). On October 30, 2020, the Company borrowed $43.0 million and on November 13, 2020, the Company borrowed an additional $152.0 million. No further borrowings are available under the Treasury Loan. The Company also issued warrants to purchase shares of common stock to the U.S. Treasury.\nThe Treasury Loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to (a)(i) the LIBOR rate divided by (ii) one minus the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage plus (b) 3.50%. Accrued interest on the loans is payable in arrears on the first business day following the 14th day of each March, June, September, and December, beginning with December 15, 2020.\nAll principal amounts outstanding under the Treasury Loan are due and payable in a single installment on October 30, 2025 (the Maturity Date). Interest is paid in kind by increasing the principal amount of the loan by the amount of such\ninterest due on an interest payment date for the first 12 months of the loan. Mesa's obligations under the Treasury Loan are secured by certain aircraft, aircraft engines, accounts receivable, ground service equipment, and tooling (collectively, the Collateral). The obligations under the Treasury Loan are guaranteed by the Company and Mesa Air Group Inventory Management. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and operating expenses, to the extent permitted by the CARES Act. Voluntary prepayments of loans under the Treasury Loan may be made, in whole or in part, by Mesa Airlines, without premium or penalty, at any time and from time to time. Amounts prepaid may not be reborrowed. Mandatory prepayments of loans under the Treasury Loan are required, without premium or penalty, to the extent necessary to comply with the covenants discussed below, certain dispositions of the Collateral, certain debt issuances secured by liens on the Collateral and certain insurance payments related to the Collateral. In addition, if a change of control (as defined in the Treasury Loan) occurs with respect to Mesa Airlines, Mesa Airlines will be required to repay the loans outstanding under the Treasury Loan.\nThe Treasury Loan requires the Company, under certain circumstances, including within 10 business days prior to the last business day of March and September of each year beginning March 2021, to appraise the value of the Collateral and recalculate the collateral coverage ratio. If the calculated collateral coverage ratio is less than 1.6 to 1.0, Mesa Airlines will be required either to provide additional Collateral (which may include cash collateral) to secure its obligations under the Treasury Loan or repay the term loans under the Treasury Loan, in such amounts that the recalculated collateral coverage ratio, after giving effect to any such additional Collateral or repayment, is at least 1.6 to 1.0.\nThe Treasury Loan contains two (2) financial covenants, a minimum collateral coverage ratio and a minimum liquidity level. The Treasury Loan also contains customary negative and affirmative covenants for credit facilities of this type, including, among others: (a) limitations on dividends and distributions; (b) limitations on the creation of certain liens; (c) restrictions on certain dispositions, investments and acquisitions; (d) limitations on transactions with affiliates; (e) restrictions on fundamental changes to the business, and (f) restrictions on lobbying activities. Additionally, the Company is required to comply with the relevant provisions of the CARES Act, including limits on employment level reductions after September 30, 2020, restrictions on dividends and stock buybacks, limitations on executive compensation, and requirements to maintain certain levels of scheduled service.\nIn connection with the Treasury Loan and as partial compensation to the U.S. Treasury for the provision of financial assistance under the Treasury Loan, the Company issued to the U.S. Treasury warrants to purchase an aggregate of 4,899,497 shares of the Companys common stock at an exercise price of $3.98 per share, which was the closing price of the Common Stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market on April 9, 2020. The exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable under the Warrants are subject to adjustment as a result of anti-dilution provisions contained in the Warrants for certain stock issuances, dividends, and other corporate actions. The warrants expire on the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance and are exercisable either through net share settlement or net cash settlement, at the Companys option. For accounting purposes, the fair value for the Warrant was estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and recorded in stockholders' equity with an offsetting debt discount to the Treasury Loan in the consolidated balance sheet.\nThe Company incurred $3.1 million in debt issuance costs relating to the Treasury Loan. In accordance with the applicable guidance, Mesa allocated the debt issuance costs between the Treasury Loan and related warrants. At funding on October 30, 2020, the initial $43.0 million was recorded net of $0.7 million in capitalized debt issuance costs. At funding on November 13, 2020, the remaining $152.0 million was recorded net of $2.3 million in capitalized debt issuance costs. The remaining $0.1 million in debt issuance costs was allocated to the warrants as a reduction to the warrant value within additional paid-in capital. Debt issuance costs allocated to the debt are amortized into interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the related loan.\nPrior to the November 13, 2020 funding of the $152.0 million portion of the Treasury Loan, the Company repaid $167.7 million in existing aircraft debt covering 44 aircraft, including indebtedness under its (a) Senior Loan Agreements, dated June 27, 2018, (b) Junior Loan Agreements, also dated June 27, 2018, (c) Credit Agreements, dated January 31, 2007, April 16, 2014, and May 23, 2014, (d) Senior Loan Agreements, dated December 27, 2017, and (e) Junior Loan Agreements, also dated December 27, 2017 (collectively, the EDC Loans). The Company made payments totaling $164.2 million to repay the EDC Loans, consisting of principal of $167.7 million, and a $3.5 million discount on the balance owed. Additionally, in connection with the repayment, $2.5 million of unamortized original issue discount and deferred financing costs were recorded as a loss on debt extinguishment, resulting in a net gain on extinguishment of $1.0 million recorded within other income.\nIn April 2022, we entered into an agreement with the U.S. Treasury to lower the minimum collateral coverage ratio covenant to 1.5 to 1.0 through September 30, 2022. As of September 30, 2022, the Company is in compliance with all debt covenants.\nSpare Engine Financing\nIn December 2021, we entered into a loan agreement with a financing institution to finance certain purchases of spare engines via a newly formed limited liability company (LLC). The loan agreement provides for aggregate borrowings of up to $54.0 million through November 2022. In December 2021, we borrowed an aggregate of $35.3 million under the loan agreement, which matures in December 2027. The borrowed amounts are collateralized by the underlying engines and require monthly principal and interest payments until maturity. Borrowings under the loan agreement bear interest at the monthly LIBOR plus 4.25%. The borrowings are the obligation of the newly formed LLC and are guaranteed by Mesa Airlines, Inc.\nThe newly formed LLC, which is wholly owned by Mesa, was determined to be a VIE for which we are the primary beneficiary because we have the power to direct the activities of the LLC that most significantly impact the LLCs economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses and right to receive benefits from the LLC in our capacity as sole member of the LLC and guarantor of the borrowings. Therefore, the LLC is consolidated in our financial statements and the borrowings are reflected as long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe loan agreement contains a loan-to-value (LTV) financial covenant pursuant to which we are required to prepay certain amounts of the loan if the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the loan exceeds a specified percentage of the appraised value of the engines beginning in the 12th full month after closing and each June 1 and December 1 thereafter.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.\n11.\nEarnings Per Share\nCalculations of net (loss) income per common share were as follows (in thousands, except per share data):\nYear Ended September 30,\nNet (loss) income\n$\n(182,678\n)\n$\n16,588\n$\n27,464\nBasic weighted average common shares\noutstanding\n36,133\n35,713\n35,237\nAdd: Incremental shares for:\nDilutive effect of warrants\n-\n2,543\n-\nDilutive effect of restricted stock\n-\nDiluted weighted average common shares\noutstanding\n36,133\n38,843\n35,308\nNet (loss) income per common share\nBasic\n$\n(5.06\n)\n$\n0.46\n$\n0.78\nDiluted\n$\n(5.06\n)\n$\n0.43\n$\n0.78\nBasic (loss) income per common share is computed by dividing net (loss) income attributable to Mesa Air Group by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.\nThe number of incremental shares from the assumed issuance of shares relating to restricted stock and exercise of warrants (excluding warrants with a nominal conversion price) is calculated by applying the treasury stock method. Share-based awards and warrants whose impact is considered to be anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method were excluded from the diluted net (loss) income per share calculation. In loss periods, these incremental shares are excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share, as the inclusion of unvested restricted stock and warrants would have an anti-dilutive effect.\nThe following number of weighted-average potentially dilutive shares (in thousands) were excluded from the calculation of diluted net (loss) income per share because the effect of including such potentially dilutive shares would have been anti-dilutive:\nYear Ended September 30,\nWarrants\n-\n-\nRestricted stock\n-\n-\n-\n-\n12.Common Stock\nIn connection with the Treasury Loan and as partial compensation to the U.S. Treasury for the provision of financial assistance under the Treasury Loan, the Company issued warrants to the U.S. Treasury to purchase shares of the Companys common stock, no par value, at an exercise price of $3.98 per share (the Exercise Price), which was the closing price of the common stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market on April 9, 2020. The warrants were issued pursuant to the terms of a Treasury Warrant Agreement entered into by the Company and the U.S. Treasury. The exercise price and number of warrant shares issuable under the warrants are subject to adjustment as a result of anti-dilution provisions contained in the warrants for certain stock issuances, dividends, and other corporate actions. The warrants expire on the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance and are exercisable either through net share settlement or net cash settlement, at the Companys option. The warrants are accounted for within equity at a grant date fair value determined under the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model. As of September 30, 2022, 4,899,497 warrants were issued and outstanding.\nThe Company has not historically paid dividends on shares of its common stock. Additionally, the Treasury Loan and the Company's aircraft lease facility (the \"RASPRO\" Lease Facility) with RASPRO Trust 2005, a pass-through trust contains restrictions that limit the Company's ability to or prohibit it from paying dividends to holders of its common stock.\n13.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes consists of the following:\nYears Ended September 30,\n(in thousands)\nCurrent\nFederal\n$\n-\n$\n(39\n)\n$\n-\nState\n$\n$\n$\nDeferred\nFederal\n(47,879\n)\n4,494\n8,404\nState\n(4,342\n)\n1,171\n$\n(52,221\n)\n$\n5,665\n$\n9,234\n(Benefit) provision for income taxes\n$\n(51,990\n)\n$\n5,828\n$\n9,531\nThe reconciliation between the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations and the statutory tax rate is as follows:\nYears Ended September 30,\n(in thousands)\nIncome tax (benefit) provision at federal statutory rate\n$\n(49,280\n)\n$\n4,707\n$\n7,769\n(Reduction) increase in income taxes resulting from:\nState taxes, net of federal tax benefit\n(3,953\n)\nNondeductible stock compensation expenses\n(241\n)\nPermanent items\nChange in valuation allowances\n(22\n)\n(140\n)\n1,173\n162(m) limitation\nImpact of changing rates on deferred tax assets\n(247\n)\n(2,313\n)\nExpired tax attributes\nOther\n(132\n)\nIncome tax (benefit) provision\n$\n(51,990\n)\n$\n5,828\n$\n9,531\nThe components of the Company's deferred taxes as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\nYears Ended September 30,\n(in thousands)\nNet operating loss carryforwards\n$\n131,897\n$\n121,604\nDeferred credits\nOther accrued expenses\n1,769\n2,682\nPrepaids and other\n1,175\n1,969\nWarrant liabilities\n5,725\n5,018\nState alternative minimum tax\nOther reserves and estimated losses\nOperating lease liabilities\n8,012\n15,226\nDeferred revenue\n5,506\n1,439\nGross deferred tax assets\n$\n155,661\n$\n149,567\nLess: valuation allowance\n(2,901\n)\n(2,922\n)\nTotal net deferred tax assets\n$\n152,760\n$\n146,645\nIntangible assets\n(877\n)\n(1,552\n)\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n(2,055\n)\n(11,467\n)\nProperty and equipment\n(166,586\n)\n(200,105\n)\nUnrealized gain on equity investments\n(961\n)\n(3,461\n)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n$\n(170,479\n)\n$\n(216,585\n)\nNet deferred tax liability\n$\n(17,719\n)\n$\n(69,940\n)\nThe Company has federal and state income tax net operating losses (NOL) carryforwards of $591.4 million and $247.0 million, which expire in fiscal years 2027-2038 and 2022-2042, respectively. Approximately $180.9 million of our federal NOL carryforwards are not subject to expiration. These NOL carryovers are only available to offset 80% of taxable income in years in which they are utilized due to tax law changes as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nThe Company believes that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state NOL carryforwards will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, the Company has provided a valuation allowance of $2.9 million as of September 30, 2022 and $2.9 million as of September 30, 2021 on the deferred tax assets related to these state NOL carryforwards. If or when recognized, the tax benefits related to any reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets will be recognized as a reduction of income tax expense.\nThe federal and state NOL carryforwards in the income tax returns filed included unrecognized tax benefits. The deferred tax assets recognized for those NOLs are presented net of these unrecognized tax benefits.\nBecause of the change of ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the use of a portion of our NOL and tax credit carryforwards may be limited in future periods. Further, a portion of the carryforwards may expire before being applied to reduce future income tax liabilities. The Company determined it had an ownership change in February of 2009. Based on the study conducted at that time, a portion of the federal NOLs were determined to be limited by IRC Section 382, resulting in the Company writing off a portion of its NOLs at that time. Additionally, the Companys initial public offering in August of 2018 resulted in a change in ownership under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company completed an update to the analysis of any potential limitation on the use of its net operating losses under Section 382 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Based on such analysis, the Company does not believe any ownership changes during the review period will further limit its ability to use its current net operating losses to offset future taxable income, if any.\nThe following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits:\nYears Ended September 30,\n(in thousands)\nUnrecognized tax benefits - October 1\n$\n4,866\n$\n4,866\n$\n4,688\nGross decreases - tax positions in prior period\n-\n-\n-\nGross increases - tax positions in prior period\n-\n-\nUnrecognized tax benefits - September 30\n$\n4,866\n$\n4,866\n$\n4,866\nThe Companys unrecognized tax benefits of $4.9 million, $4.9 million and $4.9 million as of September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, is included as an offset to the net deferred tax asset balance. If recognized, the balance of the uncertain tax benefits would impact the effective tax rate.\nWe recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties as income tax expense. We have not recorded accrued penalties or interest related to the unrecognized tax benefits noted above as the amounts would result in an adjustment to NOL carryforwards.\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States and various states. As of September 30, 2022, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal or state examinations by taxing authorities for fiscal years prior to 2002.\n14.\nShare-Based Compensation\nRestricted Stock\nThe Company grants restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") as part of its long-term incentive compensation to employees and non-employee members of the Board of Directors. RSUs generally vest over a period of three (3) to five (5) years for employees and one (1) year for members of the Board of Directors. The restricted common stock underlying RSUs are not deemed issued or outstanding upon grant, and do not carry any voting rights. RSUs are measured based on the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the grant date.\nThe restricted stock activity for our years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 is summarized as follows:\nWeighted-\nAverage\nNumber\nGrant Date\n2018 Plan\nof Shares\nFair Value\nRestricted shares unvested at September 30,\n847,974\n$\n9.56\nGranted\n910,297\n3.97\nVested\n(555,473\n)\n9.21\nCancelled\n(7,250\n)\n7.89\nRestricted shares unvested at September 30,\n1,195,548\n$\n5.47\nGranted\n346,123\n9.53\nVested\n(492,465\n)\n6.89\nCancelled\n(43,000\n)\n4.57\nRestricted shares unvested at September 30,\n1,006,206\n6.22\nGranted\n718,959\n3.20\nVested\n(455,303\n)\n6.13\nCancelled\n(97,369\n)\n2.97\nRestricted shares unvested at September 30,\n1,172,493\n$\n4.43\nAs of September 30, 2022, there was $4.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years.\nCompensation cost for share-based awards are recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The Company recognizes forfeitures of share-based awards as they occur. Share-based compensation expense for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $2.8 million, $3.1 million, and $4.4 million, respectively. Share-based compensation expense is recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income.\nThe Company repurchased 147,108 shares of its common stock for $0.5 million to cover the income tax obligation on vested employee equity awards during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. The Company repurchased 155,174 shares of its common stock for $1.5 million to cover the income tax obligation on vested employee equity awards and warrant conversions during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, the Company repurchased 142,439 shares of its common stock for $0.6 million to cover the income tax obligation on vested employee equity awards.\n15.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\n2019 ESPP\nThe Mesa Air Group, Inc. 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the \"2019 ESPP\") is a nonqualified plan that provides eligible employees of Mesa Air Group, Inc. with an opportunity to purchase Mesa Air Group, Inc. ordinary shares through payroll deductions. Under the 2019 ESPP, eligible employees may elect to contribute 1% to 15% of their eligible compensation during each semi-annual offering period to purchase Mesa Air Group, Inc. ordinary shares at a 10% discount.\nA maximum of 500,000 Mesa Air Group, Inc. ordinary shares may be issued under the 2019 ESPP. As of September 30, 2022, eligible employees purchased and the Company issued an aggregate of 304,137 Mesa Air Group, Inc. ordinary shares under the 2019 ESPP, 109,943 of which were purchased and issued during the current fiscal year.\n16.\nLeases\nAt September 30, 2022, the Company leased 16 aircraft, airport facilities, office space, and other property and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. The operating leases require the Company to pay taxes, maintenance, insurance, and other operating expenses. Rental expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, net of lessor rebates and other incentives. The Company expects that, in the normal course of business, such operating leases that expire will be renewed or replaced by other leases, or the property may be purchased rather than leased. Aggregate rental expense under all operating aircraft, equipment and facility leases totaled approximately $43.4 million, $44.6 million, and $51.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nAt September 30, 2022, the Company leased 2 aircraft and 3 spare engines under non-cancelable finance leases. Basic rent on finance leases is paid monthly and at the end of the lease term. At the end of the lease term, the Company has the option to purchase the aircraft and engines for most of the finance leases. These finance leases are reflected as finance lease obligations of $18.0 million on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2022.\nThe components of our operating and finance lease costs were as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended September 30,\nOperating lease costs\n$\n37,637\n$\n37,929\nVariable and short-term lease costs\n5,783\n6,708\nInterest expense on finance lease liabilities\nAmortization expense of finance lease assets\n2,705\n2,130\nTotal lease costs\n$\n46,672\n$\n47,343\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Companys operating lease right-of-use assets were $43.1 million, the Companys current maturities of operating lease liabilities were $17.2 million, and the Companys noncurrent operating lease liabilities were $16.7 million. As of September 30, 2022, the Companys current portion of finance lease liabilities were $2.7 million, and the Companys noncurrent finance lease liabilities were $15.3 million.\nThe Companys operating lease payments included in operating cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were $36.3 million and $47.6 million, respectively. The Companys finance lease interest payments included in operating cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were $0.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively. The Companys finance lease principal payments included in financing cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were $2.5 million and $2.3 million, respectively.\nDue to the impacts of the pilot shortage and the pilot wage increase, we evaluated all asset groups during the quarter ended September 30, 2022 and determined that only the asset group associated with the CRJ-900 fleet operating under the American CPA, discussed in Note 8, required impairment. This resulted in an impairment loss of $15.2 million to the leased aircraft within the asset group for the CRJ-900 fleet operating for the year ended September 30, 2022, which was recorded in asset impairment on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. Additionally, we recorded a $0.2 million of impairment on certain operating lease ROU assets associated with the abandonment of a leased facility during the year ended September 30, 2022. The Company did not record any impairment losses related to its operating lease right-of-use assets during the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020.\nThe table below presents the weighted average remaining terms and discount rates for our operating and finance leases as of September 30, 2022:\nAs of September 30, 2022\nFinance leases:\nWeighted average remaining lease term\n7.4 years\nWeighted average discount rate\n6.1\n%\nOperating leases:\nWeighted average remaining lease term\n3.8 years\nWeighted average discount rate\n4.5\n%\nThe following table summarizes future minimum rental payments, primarily related to leased aircraft, required under operating and finance leases that had initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms as of September 30, 2022 (in thousands):\nPeriods Ending\nSeptember 30,\nOperating Leases\nFinance\nLeases\n$\n18,356\n$\n2,730\n10,172\n7,054\n1,564\n1,800\n1,046\n1,800\n1,029\n1,800\nThereafter\n5,054\n6,600\nTotal lease payments\n37,221\n21,784\nLess: imputed interest\n(3,256\n)\n(3,746\n)\nAmounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheet\n$\n33,965\n$\n18,038\nRASPRO Lease Facility. On September 23, 2005, Mesa Airlines, as lessee, entered into the RASPRO Lease Facility, with RASPRO as lessor, for 15 of our CRJ-900 aircraft. The obligations under the RASPRO Lease Facility are guaranteed by us, and basic rent is paid quarterly on each aircraft. On each of March 10, 2014, June 5, 2014, and December 8, 2017, the RASPRO Lease Facility was amended to defer certain payments of basic rent (the \"Deferred Amounts\"). Until the principal of and accrued interest on the Deferred Amounts are paid in full: (i) we and Mesa Airlines are prohibited from paying any dividends to holders of our common stock, (ii) we are prohibited from repurchasing any of our warrants or other equity interests, (iii) Mesa Airlines must maintain a minimum of $35.0 million of cash, cash equivalents and availability under lines of credit, (iv) Mesa Airlines must provide RASPRO with periodic monthly, quarterly and annual reports containing certain financial information and forecasted engine repair costs and (v) we must maintain a minimum debt-to-assets ratio.\nIn June 2020, the Company amended its RASPRO aircraft lease agreement to defer a $4.0 million lease payment otherwise due in June 2020. Per the amended agreement dated June 5, 2020, the Company is required to pay this amount over the period of September 2021 through March 2024. The Company made the accounting election available for COVID-19 related concessions provided by a lessor and accordingly, this was not a lease modification and required no changes to current accounting treatment. As of September 30, 2022, we were in compliance with the covenants in the RASPRO Lease Facility.\n17.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nLitigation\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings (including, but not limited to, insured claims) and FAA civil action proceedings which we consider routine to our business activities on an ongoing basis. If we believe that a loss arising from such matters is probable and can be reasonably estimated, we accrue the estimated liability in our consolidated financial statements. If only a range of estimated losses can be determined, we accrue an amount within the range that, in our judgment, reflects the most likely outcome; if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the low end of the range. For those proceedings in which an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible but not probable, we have disclosed an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses or we have concluded that an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising directly from the proceeding (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) is not material. If we cannot estimate the probable or reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising from a proceeding, we have disclosed that fact. In assessing the materiality of a proceeding, we evaluate, among other factors, the amount of monetary damages claimed, as well as the potential impact of non-monetary remedies sought by plaintiffs (e.g., injunctive relief) that may require us to change our business practices in a manner that could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWith respect to the matters disclosed in Item 3: Legal Proceedings, we believed that the ultimate outcomes of the two (2) putative class action lawsuits and such other routine legal matters are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations. However, legal and regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more matters were resolved against us in a reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations, the impact on our operating results or financial condition for that reporting period could be material.\nEngine Purchase Commitments\nOn February 26, 2021, the Company and General Electric Company (GE), acting through its GE-Aviation business unit, entered into an Amended and Restated Letter Agreement No. 13-3. The Company agreed to purchase and take delivery of 10 new CF34-8C5 or CF34-8E5 engines with delivery dates starting from July 1, 2021 through November 1, 2022. During the quarter ended March 31, 2021, a $7.0 million non-refundable purchase deposit was made for the first five (5) engines to be delivered in calendar year 2021. The Company has options to purchase an additional 10 similar engines beyond 2022. The total purchase commitment related to these 10 engines is approximately $52.2 million. As of September 30, 2022, we have purchased nine (9) of the engines pursuant to the Amended and Restated Letter Agreement No. 13-3 with delivery of the remaining three (3) engines expected to take place during calendar year 2023.\nIf the Company fails to accept delivery of the spare engines when duly tendered, the Company may be assessed a minimum cancellation charge based on the engine price determined as of the date of scheduled engine delivery to the Company.\nElectric Aircraft Forward Purchase Commitments\nAs described in Note 8, in February 2021, the Company entered into a forward purchase contract with Archer for a number of electrically-powered vertical takeoff and landing aircraft (eVTOL aircraft). The aggregate base commitment for the eVTOL aircraft is $200.0 million, with an option to purchase additional aircraft. The Companys obligation to purchase the eVTOL aircraft is subject to the Company and Archer first agreeing in the future to a number of terms and conditions, which may or may not be met.\nAs described in Note 8, in July 2021, the Company entered into a forward purchase contract with Heart for a number of fully electric aircraft. The maximum aggregate base commitment for the aircraft is $1,200.0 million, with an option to purchase additional aircraft. The Companys obligation to purchase the aircraft is subject to the Company and Heart first agreeing in the future to a number of terms and conditions, which may or may not be met.\nOther Commitments\nWe have certain contracts for goods and services that require us to pay a penalty, acquire inventory specific to us or purchase contract-specific equipment, as defined by each respective contract, if we terminate the contract without cause prior to its expiration date. Because these obligations are contingent on our termination of the contract without cause prior to its expiration date, no obligation would exist unless such a termination occurs.\n18.\nSubsequent Events\nAmendment No. 11 to American CPA\nIn December 2022, we entered into Amendment No. 11 (the AA Amendment) to the American CPA. The AA Amendment provides for the termination and wind-down of the American CPA by April 3, 2023 (the Wind-down Period), at which time all Covered Aircraft (as defined in the American CPA) will be removed from the American CPA. We will begin to place aircraft operated under the American CPA with in March 2023. As of the date if this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we operate 42 CRJ-900 aircraft under the American CPA, including two (2) operational spares. The American CPA was previously set to expire by its terms on December 31, 2025.\nUnder the terms of the AA Amendment, during the Wind-down Period (i) we will continue to receive a fixed minimum monthly amount per aircraft covered by the American CPA, plus additional amounts based on the number flights and block hours actually flown during each month, subject to adjustment based on the Companys controllable completion rate and certain other factors, and (ii) American has agreed not to exercise certain any termination or withdrawal rights under the American CPA if we fail to meet certain operational performance targets for the three (3) consecutive month period ending January 31, 2023.\nProvided we comply with the terms of the American CPA during the Wind-down Period and no Material Breach (as defined in the American CPA) has occurred, American has also agreed to waive Mesas failure to meet certain past operational performance targets and other requirements, which triggered termination and withdrawal rights for American pursuant to the terms of American CPA.\nThe AA Amendment provides for liquidated damages (the Liquidated Damages Claim) payable to American in the event of a Material Breach (as defined in the American CPA) of the American CPA or a repudiation by us of our obligations under the American CPA.\nSo long as we have not caused any Material Breaches during the Wind-Down Period, then immediately upon the expiration thereof, the parties have agreed to execute a written mutual release of claims and acknowledgment that no Material Breaches have occurred under the American CPA (including, without limitation, any Liquidated Damages Claim).\nAmendment and Restatement of the United CPA\nOn December 27, 2022, we entered into the Third Amended and Restated Capacity Purchase Agreement with United (as amended and restated, the Amended and Restated United CPA), which amends and restates the Second Amended and Restated Capacity Purchase Agreement, dated as of November 4, 2020, with United (as theretofore amended). The Amended and Restated United CPA provides, among other things, for the following amended terms:\n\u25aa\nThe addition of up to 38 CRJ-900 aircraft to be operated by the Company on behalf of United under the Amended and Restated United CPA, dependent on the number of E-175 aircraft the Company is operating;\n\u25aa\nAn increase in rates to cover the Companys pilot pay increases instituted in September 2022, effective through September 2025;\n\u25aa\nUnited to be responsible for all costs associated with converting the CRJ-900 aircraft for operation in Uniteds network;\n\u25aa\nTerms providing that United may remove from the scope of the United CPA the CRJ-900, subject to certain notice and other requirements;\n\u25aa\nUniteds existing utilization waiver for the Companys operation of E175LL Covered Aircraft (as defined in the United CPA) to be extended to December 31, 2023;\n\u25aa\nThe extension of existing monthly operational performance incentives; and\n\u25aa\nAn agreement by the Company to not enter into new regional air carrier service agreements, excluding the Companys existing agreement with DHL.\nIn consideration for entering into the Amended and Restated United CPA and providing the revolving line of credit (discussed below), the Company has agreed to (i) grant United the right to designate one individual (the United Designee) to be appointed to the Companys board of directors, and (ii) issue to United shares of our common stock equal to ten percent (10.0%) of the Companys issued and outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis as of the date of such issuance (the United Shares). Uniteds board designee rights will terminate at such time as Uniteds equity ownership in the Company falls below five percent (5.0%).\nThe United Shares will be issued pursuant to an equity purchase agreement, which will contain customary representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities for such a transaction, including pre-emptive rights relating to the issuance of any equity securities by the Company. The Company will also enter into a definitive registration rights agreement with United, granting United customary demand registration rights in respect of publicly registered offerings of the Company, subject to usual and customary exceptions and limitations.\nRevolving Line of Credit\nIn connection with the above-referenced Amendment to the United CPA, United has agreed to purchase and assume, pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement (the Assignment), all of CIT Banks rights and obligations under Mesas and Mesa Air Group Airline Inventory Management, L.L.C.s existing revolving credit facility with CIT, which is guaranteed by the Company (the Existing Agreement). In connection with the effectiveness of the Assignment, the Existing Agreement will be amended (as so amended, the Amended Credit Facility) to, among other things, (i) extend the Revolving Loan Maturity Date (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility) from the earlier to occur of November 30, 2028 or the date of the termination of the United CPA; (ii) provide for a revolving loan of $10.0 million plus certain other fees (the Effective Date Bridge Loan), which will be due and payable on January 31, 2024, subject to certain mandatory prepayment requirements; (iii) provide for Revolving Commitments (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility) equal to $30.7 million (inclusive of the amount outstanding under such facility as of the effective date of the Assignment) plus the original principal amount of the Effective Date Bridge Loan; (iv) amortization of the obligations outstanding under the Existing Agreement commencing the last business day of each fiscal quarter commencing the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2025; (v) a covenant capping Restricted Payments (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility) at $5.0 million per fiscal year, a consolidated interest and rental coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00 covenant, measured at the end of each fiscal quarter, and a Liquidity (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility) requirement of not less than $15.0 million at close of any business day. Amounts borrowed under this facility bear interest at 3.50% for Base Rate Loans and 4.50% per annum for Term SOFR Loans (as each term is defined in the Amended Credit Facility. Amounts borrowed under the Amended Credit Facility will be secured by a collateral pool consisting of a combination of expendable parts, rotable parts and engines and a pledge of the Companys stock in certain aviation companies.\nAmendment to the Loan and Guarantee Agreement with the United States Department of the Treasury\nOn December 22, 2022, Mesa Air Group, Inc. (the Company) and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Mesa Airlines, Inc. (Mesa) and Mesa Air Group Airline Inventory Management, L.L.C., entered into a Modification and Waiver Agreement (the Modification Agreement) with the United States Department of the Treasury (the Treasury) and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent (the Bank of New York). The Modification Agreement provides for the amendment of the Loan and Guarantee Agreement, dated as of October 30, 2020 (as theretofore amended, the Loan Agreement), among Mesa, as Borrower, the Company, as a Guarantor, the Guarantors party thereto from time to time, the Treasury, and the Bank of New York. The amended terms include, among others, the following: (i) a modification of the Collateral Coverage Ratio covenant with respect to amounts on deposit in the Eligible Receivables Account and the Collateral Coverage Ratio covenant, effective through the maturity date of the Loan Agreement; and (ii) a waiver of the Collateral Coverage Ratio covenant requirement with respect to the release of liens on Collateral. The Modification Agreement also imposes certain obligations on the Company in connection with its sale of Collateral subject to the Loan Agreement and certain lien release obligations on the Treasury with respect to such sales. Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Loan Agreement.\nAmendment to Credit Agreement with Economic Development Corporation of Canada\nOn December 15, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement to renegotiate an existing credit agreement with the Economic Development Corporation of Canada (EDC) and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries RJ Aviation, Inc. (MHIRJ) that would, among other things, (i) reduce principal amortization on seven (7) CRJ-900 certain airframes financed with EDC for 24 months, with such deferred sum repaid at maturity in June 2027, subject to certain engine overhaul investment requirements in year two (2) to be agreed upon, and (ii) forgive $700,000 of subordinated debt payable to MHIRJ on each of the seven (7) CRJ-900 aircraft if repaid prior to December 31, 2023. ITEM 9.\nCHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.\nOur management, with the participation of our management team, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2022.\nBased on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2022 based on the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) described below.\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes a report of managements assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm because, as a Emerging Growth Company, our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to issue such an attestation report.\nThe following report is provided by management in respect of our internal control over financial reporting:\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our management used the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commissions Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), or the COSO framework, to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Management believes that the COSO framework is a suitable framework for its evaluation of financial reporting because it is free from bias, permits reasonably consistent qualitative and quantitative measurements of our internal control over financial reporting, is sufficiently complete so that those relevant factors that would alter a conclusion about the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting are not omitted and is relevant to an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting. Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022 and has concluded that such internal control over financial reporting was not effective, based on the material weaknesses described below.\nMaterial weakness in internal control over financial reporting.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Based on our assessments and those criteria, management determined that our review and oversight control activities did not operate at a sufficient level of precision to detect errors related to (1) the application of the accounting for net operating loss carryforwards governed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and (2) the accounting for the impairment of the assets. Internal controls in place were not operating effectively to prevent and detect a material misstatement. We have established plans to remediate these material weaknesses outlined below.\nManagements steps taken to remediate the material weakness.\nTo remediate these two material weaknesses, we have taken the following actions:\n1)\nWe plan to hire additional qualified personnel, to assist management with its financial statement close process and provide oversight of our financial reporting, including items of a non-routine or technical nature.\n2)\nWe plan to implement more timely operation of the review controls and improve communications amongst the various stakeholders in the company.\nOur management has concluded that the financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and is in conformity with GAAP.\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting.\nExcept with respect to the remediation actions described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2022 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent limitation on the effectiveness of internal control.\nThe effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. Accordingly, any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute assurances. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls as necessary or appropriate for our business, but cannot assure you that such improvements will be sufficient to provide us with effective internal control over financial reporting.
