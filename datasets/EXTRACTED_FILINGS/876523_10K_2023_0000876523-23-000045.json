    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nPurpose, Vision and Strategy\nEZCORP, Inc. is a leading provider of pawn services in the United States (U.S.) and Latin America with 1,231 locations and more than 7,500 Team Members. We are a Delaware corporation headquartered in Austin, Texas.\nOur purpose statement:\nWe exist to serve our customers short-term cash and pre-owned retail needs, helping them to live and enjoy their lives.\nWe are driven by a diverse team with a passion for pawn who are motivated to be their best - because our customers, families, stakeholders, and the communities and environment in which we live deserve it.\nThis purpose is supported by a customer-centric strategy that includes the following:\nProviding fast, easy and simple access to cash;\nServing our customers in a friendly and respectful way;\nAlways being competitive and fair;\nPassionately serving customer needs;\nBuilding enduring relationships; and\nRecognizing and rewarding customer loyalty.\nThat strategy consists of three fundamental pillars:\nStrengthen the Core - Relentless focus on superior execution and operational excellence in our pawn business.\nCost Efficiency and Simplification - Shape a culture of cost efficiency through ongoing focus on simplification and optimization.\nInnovate and Grow - Broaden customer engagement to serve more customers more frequently in more locations.\nAnd we rely on four foundational capabilities to execute our strategy and achieve our purpose:\nTeam Members - We enable diverse, engaged and tenured teams with a true passion for pawnbroking.\nIT and Data Modernization - We modernize our IT and data assets to capitalize on growth opportunities and create greater value at every customer interaction.\nRisk Management and Building a Culture of Compliance - We are continually focused on strengthening our capabilities to manage operational, financial, regulatory, compliance, information security and reputational risk.\nEnvironment, Social and Governance (ESG) - We prioritize developing the foundational elements of a comprehensive and integrated sustainability program.\nOverview of Our Business\nAt September 30, 2023, we operated a total of 1,231 locations, consisting of:\n529 U.S. pawn stores (operating primarily as EZPAWN or Value Pawn & Jewelry);\n549 Mexico pawn stores (operating primarily as Empe\u00f1o F\u00e1cil and Cash Apoyo Efectivo); and\n153 pawn stores in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras (operating as GuatePrenda and MaxiEfectivo).\nAt our pawn stores, we advance cash against the value of collateralized tangible personal property and sell merchandise to customers looking for good value. The merchandise we sell primarily consists of pre-owned collateral forfeited from our pawn activities or merchandise purchased from customers. By store count, we are the second largest pawn store owner and operator in the U.S. and one of the largest in Latin America. We also offer web-based applications named EZ+ that allow customers to manage their pawn transactions, layaways and loyalty rewards online.\nIn addition to our core pawn business in the U.S. and Latin America, we have made the following strategic investments:\nWe own 43.7% of Cash Converters International Limited (Cash Converters), a publicly traded company (ASX: CCV) headquartered in Perth, Western Australia. Cash Converters and its controlled companies comprise a diverse group generating revenues from franchising, store operations, personal finance (including pawn transactions) and vehicle finance in over 600 stores across 14 countries.\nWe own a preferred interest in Founders One, LLC (Founders) that has majority ownership in Simple Management Group, Inc. (SMG), which owns and operates 95 pawn stores in the U.S., Caribbean and Central America, with plans to build and acquire more stores in that region.\nWe generate revenues primarily from pawn service charges (PSC) on pawn loans outstanding (PLO), merchandise sales and jewelry scrapping. We remain focused on optimizing our balance of PLO and the resulting higher PSC. The following chart presents sources of gross profit, including PSC, merchandise sales gross profit (Merchandise sales GP) and jewelry scrapping gross profit (Jewelry scrapping GP) for fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021:\nThe following charts present sources of gross profit by geography for fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021:\nSegment and Geographic Information\nWe conduct our business globally and manage our business by geography. Our business is organized into the following reportable segments:\nU.S. Pawn, which includes our EZPAWN, Value Pawn & Jewelry and other branded pawn operations in the United States;\nLatin America Pawn, which includes our Empe\u00f1o F\u00e1cil, Cash Apoyo Efectivo (CAE) and other branded pawn operations in Mexico, as well as our GuatePrenda and MaxiEfectivo pawn operations in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras (referred to as GPMX);\nCash Converters, which includes our equity interest in the net loss (income) of Cash Converters; and\nOther Investments, which includes our investments in Rich Data Corporation (RDC) and our investment in and notes receivable from Founders.\nThe following table presents store data by segment:\nCompany-owned Stores\nU.S. Pawn Latin America Pawn Other Investments Consolidated\nAs of September 30, 2020\n505 500 - 1,005\nNew locations opened - 15 - 15\nLocations acquired 11 128 - 139\nLocations sold, combined or closed - (11) - (11)\nAs of September 30, 2021\n516 632 - 1,148\nNew locations opened - 28 - 28\nLocations acquired 3 - - 3\nLocations sold, combined or closed (4) - - (4)\nAs of September 30, 2022\n515 660 - 1,175\nNew locations opened 3 44 - 47\nLocations acquired 12 - - 12\nLocations sold, combined or closed (1) (2) - (3)\nAs of September 30, 2023\n529 702 - 1,231\nFor additional information about our segments and geographic areas, see Note 14: Segment Information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplemental Data.\nPawn Activities\nAt our pawn stores, we advance cash against the value of collateralized tangible personal property. We earn pawn service charges (PSC) for those cash advances, and the PSC rate varies by state and transaction size. At the time of the transaction, we take possession of the pawned collateral, which consists of tangible personal property, generally jewelry, consumer electronics, tools, sporting goods and musical instruments. If the customer chooses to redeem their pawn, they will repay the amount advanced plus any accrued PSC. If the customer chooses not to redeem their pawn, the pawned collateral becomes our inventory, which we sell in our retail merchandise sales activities or, in some cases, scrap for its inherent gold or precious stone content. Consequently, the success of our pawn business is largely dependent on our ability to accurately assess the probability of pawn redemption and the estimated resale or scrap value of the collateralized personal property.\nAs of September 30, 2023, we had a closing PLO balance of $245.8 million. In fiscal 2023, PSC accounted for approximately 37% of our total revenues and 63% of our gross profit.\nIn the U.S., PSC rates generally vary between 13% and 25% per month as permitted by applicable law, and the pawn term generally ranges between 30 and 90 days. Individual pawn transactions typically average between $160 and $180.\nIn Mexico, PSC rates generally vary between 15% and 21% per month as permitted by applicable law, and the pawn primary term is 30 days. Individual pawn transactions typically average between 1,100 and 1,500 Mexican pesos, or approximately $60 to $80 on average using the average exchange rate for fiscal 2023.\nIn GPMX, PSC rates generally vary between 12% and 18% per month as permitted by applicable law, and the pawn primary term is 30 days. Individual pawn transactions are made in the local currency of the country and typically average between $110 and $130 using the average exchange rates for fiscal 2023. The average transaction amounts tend to be higher in the GPMX countries than in Mexico due to the higher concentration of jewelry used as pawn collateral.\nIf a customer chooses not to redeem, renew or extend their pawn, the pawn collateral is forfeited and becomes inventory available for sale. We do not record losses or charge-offs when the pawned collateral is forfeited because the amount advanced for the unpaid pawn becomes the inventory carrying cost of the forfeited collateral. The difference between the subsequent sale of the forfeited collateral and the amount of the pawn (offset by any inventory reserve) is reflected in merchandise sales gross margin.\nOur ability to offer quality pre-owned goods at prices significantly lower than original retail prices attracts value-conscious customers. The gross profit on sales of inventory depends primarily on our assessment of the estimated resale or scrap value at the time the property is either accepted as pawn collateral or purchased and our ability to sell that merchandise in a timely manner. As a significant portion of our inventory and sales involve gold and jewelry, our results can be influenced by the market price of gold and diamonds.\nCustomers in the U.S. and the majority of our Latin America stores may purchase a product protection plan that allows them to exchange certain general merchandise (non-jewelry) sold through our retail pawn operations within six months of purchase. In the U.S., we also offer a jewelry VIP package, which guarantees customers a minimum future pawn advance amount on the item sold, allows them full credit if they trade in the item to purchase a more expensive piece of jewelry and provides minor repair service on the item sold. Customers may also purchase an item on layaway by paying a minimum layaway deposit of typically 10% of the items sale price, in addition to an upfront fee. We hold items on layaway for a 90-to-180-day period, during which the customer is required to pay the balance of the sales price through a series of installment payments. If a payment is missed, we hold the item for up to 30 days, after which it is returned to active inventory for sale.\nOperations and Risk Management\nOur pawn operations are designed to provide the optimum level of support to the store teams, providing coaching, mentoring and problem solving to identify opportunities to better serve our customers and position us to be the leader in customer service and satisfaction.\nOur risk management structure consists of asset protection, compliance and internal audit departments, which monitor the inventory system, lending practices, regulatory compliance and compliance with our policies and procedures. We perform full physical audits of inventory at each store at least annually, and more often in higher risk stores or those experiencing higher shrinkage. Inventory counts are completed daily for jewelry and firearms, and other inventory categories more susceptible to theft are cycle counted multiple times annually. We record shrink adjustments for known losses at the conclusion of each inventory count. These adjustments are recorded as estimates during interim periods and as discovered during cycle counts.\nHuman Capital Management\nEngagement Survey\nWe performed a Global Employee Engagement Survey, administered by Glint, in April 2023, and had a 91% participation rate with an overall engagement score of 84. Our engagement score is nine points higher than the global benchmark, which contains data from over 900 companies of varying size across a variety of industries (Finance, Healthcare, Manufacturing, Professional Services, Retail, Technology and Utilities) and includes results from over eight million respondents located in over 150 countries.\nOur top strengths were Career, Customer Focus and Continuous Improvement. Our focus areas for improvement included Team, Valued Teammate and Work-Life Balance. Team Members provided over 11,500 comments with mixed sentiment, 29% positive, 38% neutral and 33% negative. To ensure we address issues raised in the survey, all people leaders at the District Manager and above level will have Engagement Objectives for fiscal 2024 guided by actions that will yield the greatest business and Team Member impact.\nTalent Management and Development\nWe employ more than 7,500 Team Members across all our geographies, including over 3,400 in United States, approximately 3,300 in Mexico and 800 in Central America. We seek to hire and promote Team Members to lead the way today and to step into greater roles in the future. We achieve this goal through Training and Development programs that Team Members can use to plan their careers and identify future growth opportunities. We engage Team Members at all levels so we can understand their professional and personal goals, identify high potential future leaders to strengthen our internal bench, support them in their journey and retain our talent.\nIn our pawn stores we provide:\nAn onboarding program that blends online and hands-on training in the art and science of pawnbroking;\nCareer path programs aligned with our talent and succession strategy, emphasizing career progression and individual development programs; and\nA learning experience that unlocks and accelerates Team Member potential as well as business growth.\nOur investment in store-level Team Members produced tangible results during fiscal 2023:\nHigh scoring questions in our 2023 Global Employee Engagement Survey included I know the career path(s) available to me at EZCORP (with an 89% favorability rating) and I have good opportunities to learn and develop at EZCORP (with an 86% favorability rating).\nOver 70% of managerial positions were filled via internal promotion.\nIn our Corporate Support Center, we reinforced the utilization of our career and competency framework to build individual development plans to guide the career paths of corporate Team Members and to prepare them for future roles.\nCulture and Ethics\nCulture is critical to our long-term success and to our ability to attract, develop and retain the top talent needed to accomplish our Purpose, Vision and Strategy.\nOur values - People, Pawn, Passion - define our priorities as a business, and our Guiding Principles - Leadership, Customer Service, Accountability, Respect, Diversity and Sustainability - characterize the expectations for how we interact with Team Members, customers and communities. Various tools are used globally to demonstrate commitment to our principles, values and positive culture, including a plain-language Code of Conduct and supporting policies, annual training on expectations and clear communications from executive management reinforcing ethical behavior and a positive culture.\nTo support our ethical business practices, we maintain an Ethics Hotline available to all Team Members and external stakeholders to report (anonymously if desired) any matter of concern. Communications to the hotline (which is managed by an independent third party) are routed to appropriate functions (whether Human Resources, Legal or Compliance), and in some cases directly to the Board of Directors, for investigation and resolution. In addition, any shareholder or other interested party may send communications to the Board of Directors, either individually or as a group, through a process that is outlined in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nAt EZCORP, we foster an environment that values diversity, inclusion and development for all. In our 2023 Global Employee Engagement Survey, 83% of participants responded positively to the question, I feel a sense of belonging at EZCORP. In fiscal 2023, we continued to further our Diversity and Inclusion strategy by focusing on the following initiatives:\nCommitment and Accountability - Demonstrate commitment and accountability through corporate policy, communications and actions.\nWorkplace Inclusion - Foster work environments that value diversity and inclusion and encourage collaboration, flexibility and fairness.\nDiverse Workforce - Recruit and promote from diverse, qualified candidate pools to increase diversity of perspectives and experiences.\nSponsor affinity groups to foster an inclusive and supportive environment, where Team Members with shared characteristics, experiences or interests can connect, collaborate and contribute effectively. The Womens Empowerment, Black Empowerment and Hispanic Organization for Leadership Advocacy (HOLA) affinity groups in the U.S. and the Womens Empowerment and Working Parents affinity groups in Latin America all aim to enhance diversity, equity and inclusion efforts by providing a platform for open dialogue, resource-sharing, professional development and cultural enrichment.\nSustainability - Identify and eliminate systemic barriers by embedding diversity and inclusion in all human capital life cycle policies and practices.\nFiscal 2023 U.S. Race and Ethnicity Demographics (1) (2)\nFiscal 2023 Global Gender Demographics (2)\n(1) The term underrepresented minority is used to describe diverse populations, including African American, Hispanic, Asian and Native American Team Members who self-identified their race and ethnicity at hire.\n(2) The term Management is used to describe Team Members with one or more direct reports.\nTotal Rewards\nOur compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of Team Members with individual and Company performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate Team Members to achieve results.\nThe structure of our compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance. Specifically:\nWe provide wages and incentive plans that are competitive and consistent with positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location. Additionally, on an annual basis (U.S.) gender and racial/ethnic analysis is performed to ensure pay equity.\nWe engage a nationally recognized outside compensation and benefits consulting firm to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our executive compensation and to provide benchmarking against our selected peer group, which includes direct competitors in the pawn industry and similarly-sized companies from relevant industries that serve similar customer bases, operate in the retail or consumer finance industries and typically have similar operating dynamics.\nWe align our executives long-term equity compensation with our shareholders interests by linking realizable pay with stock performance.\nAll employees are eligible for paid time off, retirement savings plan and Company-paid life insurance.\nHealth and Safety\nOur commitment to our Team Members is to provide a safe and injury-free workplace. We continue to invest in programs designed to improve physical, mental and social well-being.\nManagement and Oversight\nThe People and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has primary responsibility for analyzing, advising and (as appropriate) approving executive compensation. The committee is also responsible for organizational development matters and otherwise assisting the Board of Directors in its overall responsibility to enable EZCORP to attract, retain, develop and motivate qualified executives who will contribute to the long-term success of the Company.\nThe committee actively participates in the executive recruitment and selection process. Committee members are instrumental in the executive talent management and succession processes, including the review and attainment of annual objectives for our executive officers. All Executive Officers have a minimum of one objective related to People, generally broken into the areas of Employee Engagement Scores, Voluntary Attrition and Inclusion.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG)\nEZCORP is committed to meeting our customers needs in a responsible manner, and in that regard, we have aligned purpose, vision, values, guiding principles and business strategy with environmental, social and governance sustainability factors.\nOur pawnbroking and related retail sales activities inherently contribute to the circular economy and promote environmental sustainability. We provide unique options for our customers to satisfy their needs for cash - options that are not offered by traditional lenders such as banks and credit unions, credit card providers, or installment and short-term lenders. For many of our customers, pawn transactions provide an essential and financially responsible lifeline for meeting their unexpected expenses. Our retail activities rely primarily on local sourcing of pre-owned merchandise and the recirculation of those items back into the neighborhoods we serve. In short, our business is unique, essential and sustainable.\nEnvironmental Sustainability\nOur business contributes to overall environmental sustainability in the following ways:\nOur business is fundamentally a neighborhood business, where each store principally serves the surrounding neighborhood. This local focus reduces the need of our customers to travel long distances to access our products and services and eliminates the need for delivery services.\nEach of our stores serves as its own supply chain. We take in pre-owned merchandise, either through pawn or purchases from customers, and then sell that merchandise (after forfeiture, in the case of pawn transactions) generally in the same store. Thus, we do not maintain or rely on mass supply, distribution or warehousing facilities.\nVirtually all of the merchandise we sell is pre-owned, which contributes to pre-owned goods recycling and the circular economy. In fiscal 2023, we sold approximately 5.4 million pre-owned items, including over 3.2 million items in the consumer electronics, camera and household goods categories, 1.1 million other general merchandise items (such as tools and musical instruments) and 0.8 million jewelry items. In addition, through our jewelry scrapping activities, we recycle significant volumes of gold and diamonds. All of these activities effectively extend the useful life of many products, reducing waste and lessening the demand for new manufacturing and mining.\nOur store operations themselves leave a relatively small carbon footprint when compared to big-box or other mass retailers that rely on manufacturers and extensive supply chain and distribution channels. Our stores are relatively small (generally 3,300 square feet or less). To reduce energy consumption, we have installed energy-efficient LED lighting in 78% of our U.S. stores and 60% of Latin America stores.\nIn all of our facilities, including our corporate support offices, we promote environmental stewardship by reducing consumption, recycling paper products (approximately 1.24 million pounds across all U.S. locations during fiscal 2023) and responsibly disposing of end-of-life computers, electronics and related accessories through recycling or other sound e-waste processing. Our corporate office in Austin, Texas is LEED Certified Silver status.\nSocial Responsibility\nOur business promotes social responsibility in the following ways:\nOur business serves as an essential and responsible financial resource for many unbanked and or underserved consumers who have limited access to traditional forms of capital or credit and comprise a large majority of our customer base. We improve the reach and access to financial services through neighborhood-based stores, supported by digital offerings. We provide instant access to cash in transactions that generally average around $180 or less. Our pawn transactions are simple, transparent, regulated and safe, and funding approval is based on the valuation of the collateral item, not on the credit worthiness of the customer. The customer is under no legal obligation to repay the amount advanced; we do not engage in collection efforts or take other legal actions against our customers; and we do not report transaction histories to external credit agencies. Rather, the customer may choose to repay the amount advanced or forfeit the collateralized merchandise.\nCustomer satisfaction measurement and feedback are key factors in improving our customer service and Team Member engagement. To capture direct customer feedback, we have enabled Google Reviews across all stores and have received over 195,000 Google reviews with an average satisfaction rating of 4.8 out of 5 across U.S and Latin America.\nWe offer customers multiple payment options, including cross-store, over-the-phone and web-based and mobile platforms, reducing their need to travel to the stores to make payments. Online payments are accepted on layaway, pawn extension and bulk payments, with electronic payment receipts delivered on these transactions.\nWe have refreshed the mission of EZCORP Foundation, our philanthropic arm that is focused on making a difference in communities where we live and operate by supporting charitable organizations that align with our operating values of People, Pawn and Passion. Current initiatives include supporting financial literacy efforts, working to eradicate food insecurity, empowering young people to succeed and other poverty intervention activities.\nFor a discussion of our Diversity and Inclusion initiatives, see Human Capital Management - Diversity and Inclusion above.\nGovernance\nAt EZCORP, we believe that The Way We Do Business is as Important as the Business We Do. That belief underlies our Code of Conduct, which outlines our expectations and provides guidance on how our Team Members can carry out their daily activities ethically and responsibly. Our ethical principles include Honesty, Integrity, Reliability, Loyalty, Respect, Responsibility, Fairness, Caring, Leadership and Diversity, and these principles form the foundation for how we govern our business.\nEven though we are a Controlled Company under the Nasdaq Listing Rules, we maintain the governance standards required of all publicly-listed Nasdaq companies, including:\nIndependent directors comprise a majority of our Board of Directors. Four of the seven members of our Board of Directors meet all of the independence requirements set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rules, and none of the independent directors have any past or existing relationship with our controlling stockholder outside of their Board service.\nAll of our standing Board committees (Audit Committee, People and Compensation Committee and Nominating Committee) are comprised of solely independent directors.\nWe satisfy Nasdaqs board diversity rules, with two of our seven Board members being diverse directors, one of whom self-identifies as female and an underrepresented minority and one whom self-identifies as an underrepresented minority.\nFor further discussion of our corporate governance standards, see Part III, Item 10 - Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.\nOur pawn operations are licensed and supervised in all jurisdictions in which we operate. We maintain a strong compliance culture that is monitored and overseen by our Board of Directors and supported by seasoned regulatory and compliance teams.\nProtecting the privacy, integrity and security of our customers data and our enterprise network is a top priority that is also monitored and overseen by our Board of Directors. We maintain a separate IT Security team that is responsible for the design and implementation of our cyber risk strategy, including deployment of systems, enterprise-wide training, monitoring and reporting of threat incidents and response preparedness.\nGrowth and Expansion\nPart of our strategy is to grow the number of locations we operate through opening new (de novo) locations and through acquisitions in both Latin America and the U.S. and potential new markets. Our ability to add new stores is dependent on several variables, such as projected achievement of internal investment hurdles, the availability of acceptable sites or acquisition candidates, the alignment of acquirer/seller price expectations, the regulatory environment, local zoning ordinances, access to capital and availability of qualified personnel.\nDuring fiscal 2023, we continued our expansion in Latin America with the opening of 44 de novo stores (23 in Mexico, 19 in Guatemala and 2 in Honduras). We now own a total of 702 stores in Latin America, representing 57% of our total pawn stores. In fiscal 2023, these stores represented 25% of our consolidated gross profit as the average scale of Latin America pawn stores is smaller than in the U.S. We see opportunity for further expansion in Latin America through both acquisitions and de novo openings.\nFor further information about our acquisitions, see Note 3: Acquisitions of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplemental Data.\nSeasonality and Quarterly Results\nIn the U.S., PSC is historically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter (July through September) due to a higher average PLO balance during the summer and lowest in our third fiscal quarter (April through June) following the tax refund season, and merchandise sales are highest in our first and second fiscal quarters (October through March) due to the holiday season, jewelry sales surrounding Valentines Day and the availability of tax refunds. In Latin America, most of our customers receive additional compensation from their employers in December, and many receive additional compensation in June or July, applying downward pressure on PLO balances and fueling some merchandise sales in those periods. In Mexico, we saw similar downward pressure in loan balances during the third quarter due to a recent change in law related to company profit sharing payments to employees. We believe this change will impact pawn loan balances in May and June going forward. As a net effect of these and other factors and excluding discrete charges, our consolidated profit before tax is generally highest in our first fiscal quarter (October through December) and lowest in our third fiscal quarter (April through June).\nCompetition\nWe encounter significant competition in connection with all of our activities. These competitive conditions may have an impact on our revenues, profitability and ability to expand. We compete with other pawn stores, credit service organizations, banks, credit unions and other financial institutions, such as consumer finance companies. We believe the primary elements of competition are the quality of customer service and relationship management, including understanding our customers needs better than anyone else, convenience, store location and a customer-friendly environment. In addition, we believe the ability to compete effectively will be based increasingly on strong general management, regional focus, automated management information systems, access to capital and superior customer service.\nOur competitors for merchandise sales include numerous retail and wholesale stores such as jewelry stores, discount retail stores, consumer electronics stores, other pawn stores, other resale stores, electronic commerce retailers and auction sites. Competitive factors in our retail operations include the ability to provide customers with a variety of merchandise at an exceptional value coupled with exceptional customer service and convenient locations.\nThe pawn industry in the U.S. is large, relatively mature and highly fragmented. The industry consists of a few large operators (of which we are the second largest) and then independent operators who primarily own one-to-three locations.\nThe pawn industry in Latin America is also fragmented, but less so than in the U.S. The industry consists of pawn stores owned by independent operators and chains, including some not-for-profit organizations. We are the second largest for-profit operator in Mexico and the largest operator in Guatemala. The pawn industry, particularly full-line stores dealing in both general merchandise and jewelry, remains in an expansion stage in Latin America.\nWe launched our EZ+ Rewards loyalty program in the U.S. and Mexico in 2021 and in GPMX in 2022, and now have 3.8 million members globally. This free program allows customers to earn points on most transactions that may be applied as a discount towards retail sales once a certain threshold is met. We believe this program provides a distinct competitive advantage over other pawn operators.\nTrademarks and Trade Names\nWe operate our U.S. pawn stores principally under the names EZPAWN or Value Pawn & Jewelry, our Mexico pawn stores principally under the name EMPE\u00d1O F\u00c1CIL and Cash Apoyo Efectivo, our Guatemala pawn stores under the name GuatePrenda, and our El Salvador and Honduras pawn stores under the name MaxiEfectivo. We have registered the names EZPAWN, Value Pawn & Jewelry and EZCORP, among others, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In Mexico, we have registered the names EMPE\u00d1O F\u00c1CIL, Bazare\u00f1o, Presta Dinero, Montepio San Patricio and Cash Apoyo Efectivo with the Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrial. We have registered the name GuatePrenda in Guatemala and the name MaxiEfectivo in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.\nRegulation\nCompliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations is an integral part of how we manage our business, and we conduct our business in material compliance with all of these rules. The following is a general description of significant regulations affecting our business.\nU.S. Regulations\nPawn Regulations - Our pawn stores are regulated by the states in which they are located and, in some cases, by individual municipalities or other local authorities. The applicable statutes, ordinances and regulations vary from location to location and typically impose licensing requirements for pawn stores or individual pawn store Team Members. Licensing requirements typically relate to financial responsibility and character and may establish restrictions on where pawn stores can operate. Additional rules regulate various aspects of the day-to-day pawn operations, including the pawn service charges that a pawn store may charge, the maximum amount of a pawn loan, the minimum or maximum term of a pawn loan, the content and format of the pawn ticket, and the length of time after a pawn loan default that a pawn store must hold a pawned item before it can be offered for sale. Failure to observe applicable regulations could result in a revocation or suspension of pawn licenses, the imposition of fines or requirements to refund service charges and fees, and other civil or criminal penalties. We must also comply with various federal requirements regarding the disclosure of the annual percentage rate, finance charge, amount financed, total of payments and payment schedule related to each pawn loan transaction. Additional federal regulations applicable to our pawn lending business are described in Other Regulations below.\nThe majority of our pawn stores, voluntarily or pursuant to applicable laws, provide periodic (generally daily) reports to local law enforcement agencies. These reports provide local law enforcement with information about the items received from customers (whether through pawn or purchase), including a detailed description of the goods involved and the name and address of the customer. If we accept as collateral or purchase merchandise from a customer and it is determined that our customer was not the rightful owner, the merchandise is subject to recovery by the rightful owner and those losses are included in our shrinkage. Historically, we have not experienced a material number of claims of this nature.\nSome of our pawn stores in the U.S. handle firearms and each of those stores maintains a federal firearms license as required by federal law. The federal Gun Control Act of 1968 and regulations issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives also require each pawn store dealing in firearms to maintain a permanent written record of all receipts and dispositions of firearms. In addition, we must comply with the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which requires us to conduct a background check before releasing, selling or otherwise disposing of firearms.\nOther Regulations - Our pawn lending activities are subject to other state and federal statutes and regulations, including the following:\nWe are subject to the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and its underlying regulations, as well as various state laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security. Under these regulations, we are required to disclose to our customers our policies and practices relating to the protection and sharing of customers nonpublic personal information. These regulations also require us to ensure that our systems are designed to protect the confidentiality of customers nonpublic personal information, and many of these regulations dictate certain actions that we must take to notify customers if their personal information is disclosed in an unauthorized manner. We are subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which was enacted, in part, to address privacy concerns associated with the sharing of consumers financial information and credit history contained in consumer credit reports and limits our ability to share certain consumer report information. We are subject to the Federal Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, which amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act and requires us to adopt written guidance and procedures for detecting, preventing and mitigating identity theft, and to adopt various policies and procedures (including Team Member training) that address and aid in detecting and responding to suspicious activity or identity theft red flags.\nAs a provider of consumer financial products, we are prohibited from engaging in any unfair, deceptive or abusive act or practice (UDAAP) under the Dodd-Frank Act, as they can cause significant financial injury to consumers, erode consumer confidence and undermine the financial marketplace.\nThe Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, receipt of public assistance or good faith exercise of any rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.\nUnder the USA PATRIOT Act, we must maintain an anti-money laundering compliance program that includes the development of internal policies, procedures and controls; the designation of a compliance officer; an ongoing Team Member training program and an independent audit function to test the program.\nWe are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and its underlying regulations, which require us to report and maintain records of certain high-dollar transactions. In addition, federal laws and regulations require us to report certain transactions (or series of transactions) deemed suspicious to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury Department (FinCen). Generally, a transaction is considered suspicious if we know, suspect or have reason to suspect that the transaction (a) involves funds derived from illegal activity or is intended to hide or disguise such funds, (b) is designed to evade the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act or (c) appears to serve no legitimate business or lawful purpose.\nThe Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the Department of the Treasury administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries and regimes, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and other threats to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States. We are prohibited from doing business with named individuals, businesses and countries subject to sanctions and restrictions, and we are required to report any transactions involving those named by the US. Department of the Treasury.\nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") makes it unlawful for certain classes of persons and entities to make payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business. Specifically, the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA prohibit the willful use of mail or any means of instrumentality of interstate commerce corruptly in furtherance of any offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization of the payment of money or anything of value to any person, while knowing that all or a portion of such money or thing of value will be offered, given or promised, directly or indirectly, to a foreign official to influence the foreign official in his or her official capacity, induce the foreign official to do or omit to do an act in violation of his or her lawful duty, or to secure any improper advantage in order to assist in obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing business to, any person.\nThe Department of Defense regulations promulgated under the Military Lending Act limit the annual percentage rate charged on certain consumer loans (including pawn loans) made to active military personnel or their dependents to 36%.\nUnder certain circumstances, the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) may be able to exercise regulatory authority over the U.S. pawn industry through its rule making authority. To date, the CFPB has not taken any steps to exercise such authority or indicated any intention to do so, although it has initiated actions against pawn companies for alleged violations of consumer lending regulations, including the Military Lending Act discussed above.\nMexico Regulations\nPawn Regulations - Federal law in Mexico provides for administrative regulation of the pawnshop industry by Procuradur\u00eda Federal del Consumidor (PROFECO), Mexicos primary federal consumer protection agency. PROFECO regulates the form and terms of pawn loan contracts (but not interest or service charge rates) and defines certain operating standards and procedures for pawnshops, including retail operations, and establishes registration, disclosure, bonding and reporting requirements. There are significant fines and sanctions, including operating suspensions, for failure to comply with PROFECOs rules and regulations.\nPROFECO requires that we report certain transactions (or series of transactions) when a customer pawns more than three items of the same category. Anti-money laundering regulations restrict the use of cash in certain transactions. Relevant aspects of the law specifically affecting the pawn industry include monthly reporting on vulnerable activities, which includes certain high-value pawn and precious metal transactions.\nThe Federal Law on the Protection of Personal Data Held by Private Parties requires us to protect our customers personal information. This law requires us to inform customers if we share customer personal information with third parties and to post (both online and in-store) our Data Privacy Policy.\nOur pawn business in Mexico is also subject to regulation at the state and local level through state laws and local zoning and permitting ordinances. For example, some states require permits for pawn stores to operate, certification of Team Members as trained in the valuation of merchandise and strict customer identification controls. State and local agencies often have authority to suspend store operations pending resolution of actual or alleged regulatory, licensing and permitting issues.\nOther Regulations - Our pawn business in Mexico is subject to the General Law of Administrative Responsibility (GLAR), which requires us to implement an integrity policy that contains mechanisms to ensure integrity standards throughout the organization. GLAR establishes administrative penalties for improper payments to government officials, influence peddling (including the hiring of public officials and the use of undue influence) and other corrupt acts in public procurement processes.\nWe are also subject to The Federal Law for the Prevention and Identification of Transactions with Funds from Illegal Sources, which requires reporting of certain transactions exceeding certain monetary limits, the appointment of a compliance officer and maintenance of customer identification records and controls. This law affects all vulnerable activities in Mexico and is intended to detect commercial activities arising from illicit or ill-gotten means through bilateral cooperation between Mexicos Ministry of Finance and Public Credit and Mexicos Attorney Generals Office. The law also restricts the use of cash in certain transactions associated with high-value assets and limits, and to the extent possible, money laundering activities protected by the anonymity that such cash transactions provide. Relevant aspects of the law specifically affecting the pawn industry include monthly reporting on vulnerable activities, which include pawn transactions exceeding 166,502.70 Mexican pesos and retail transactions of precious metals exceeding 166,502.70 Mexican pesos. Retail transactions of precious metals in cash exceeding 333,005.40 Mexican pesos are prohibited. There are significant fines and sanctions for failure to comply with these rules.\nWe must also comply with the Official Mexican Standards issued by regulatory agencies in accordance with Article 40 of the Federal Law on Metrology and Standardization, which establishes rules applicable to a retail products and services, and related disclosures, labeling, and marketing, including NOM-179-SCFI-2016, NOM-017-SCFI-1993, and NOM-024-SCFI-2013.\nIn addition to the above, our pawn business in Mexico is subject to various general business regulations in the areas of tax compliance, customs, consumer protections, money laundering, civil protection regulations, municipal regulations, trade code (federal), public safety and employment matters, among others, by various federal, state and local governmental agencies.\nOther Latin American Regulations\nLocal governmental entities in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras also regulate lending and retail businesses. Certain laws and local zoning and permitting ordinances require basic commercial business licenses and signage permits. Operating in these countries also subjects us to other types of regulations, including regulations related to financial reporting, data protection and privacy, tax compliance, labor and employment practices, real estate transactions, anti-money laundering, commercial and electronic banking restrictions, credit card transactions, usury law, consumer protection, marketing, advertising and other general business activities. As the scope of our international operations increases, we may face additional administrative and regulatory costs in managing our business. In addition, unexpected changes in laws and regulations, administrative interpretations of local requirements or legislation, or public remarks by elected officials could negatively affect our operations and profitability.\nAvailable Information\nWe file annual, quarterly and current reports and other documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). The SEC maintains an internet website that contains reports and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The public can obtain any documents that we file with the SEC at www.sec.gov.\nWe maintain a website at www.ezcorp.com. Our filings with the SEC, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and Section 16 filings, are available free of charge through links maintained on our website under the heading Investor Relations - SEC Filings. Information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this report. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThere are many risks and uncertainties that may affect our operations, performance, development and results. Many of these risks are beyond our control. The following is a description of the important risk factors that may affect our business. If any of these risks were to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCompany Specific Risks\nChanges in, or failure to comply with, laws and regulations affecting our products and services could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.\nOur products and services are subject to regulation under various laws and regulations in each country and jurisdiction in which we operate (see Part I, Item 1 - Business - Regulation), and adverse legislation or regulations could be adopted in any such country or jurisdiction. If such legislation or regulation is adopted in any particular jurisdiction, we generally evaluate our business in the context of the new rules and determine whether we can continue to operate in that jurisdiction with new or modified products or whether it is feasible to enhance our business with additional product offerings. In any case, if we are unable to continue to operate profitably under the new rules, we may decide to close or consolidate stores, resulting in decreased revenues, earnings and assets. Further, our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties or orders to cease or suspend operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nNegative characterizations of the pawn industry by consumer advocates, media or others could result in increased legislative or regulatory activity, could adversely affect the market value of our publicly traded stock, or could make it harder to operate our business successfully.\nMany of the legislative and regulatory efforts that are adverse to the pawn industry are the result of negative characterization of the pawn industry by consumer advocacy groups, members of the media or others that focus on the cost of pawn loans or instances of pawn operators purchasing stolen property or accepting it as pawn collateral. We can give no assurance that there will not be further negative characterizations of our industry or that legislative or regulatory efforts to restrict the availability of pawn loans or otherwise regulate pawn operations will not be successful despite significant customer demand for such services. Such efforts, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial performance.\nFurthermore, negative characterizations of our industry could limit the number of investors who are willing to hold our Class A Common Stock, which may adversely affect its market value; limit sources of the debt or equity financing that we need in order to conduct our operations and achieve our strategic growth objectives; or make it harder for us to attract, hire and retain talented executives and other key Team Members.\nA significant portion of our U.S. business is concentrated in Texas and Florida.\nAs of September 30, 2023, more than 62% of our U.S. pawn stores were located in Texas (45%) and Florida (17%), and those stores account for a significant portion of our revenues and profitability. The legislative, regulatory and general business environment in Texas and Florida has been relatively favorable for our pawn business activities, but a negative legislative or regulatory change in either of those states could have a material adverse effect on our overall operations and financial performance. Further, as discussed below, areas in Texas and Florida where we have significant operations are particularly susceptible to hurricane and tropical storm activity.\nA significant or sudden decrease in gold values or the volume of gold transactions may have a material impact on our earnings and financial position.\nGold jewelry comprises a large portion of the collateral security for our pawn loans and our inventory. PSC, sales proceeds and our ability to liquidate excess jewelry inventory at an acceptable margin are dependent upon gold values and the volume of gold transactions. A decline in the availability of gold or our customers willingness or ability to sell us gold or use gold as collateral for pawn loans could impact our business. The impact on our financial position and results of operations of decreases in gold values or volumes or a change in customer behavior cannot be reasonably estimated because the market and customer response to changes in gold values is not known; however, a significant decline in gold values or gold volumes could result in decreases in sales, sales margins, PLO and PSC.\nFluctuations in our sales, PLO, sales margins and pawn redemption rates could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nWe regularly experience fluctuations in a variety of operating metrics. Changes in any of these metrics, as might be caused by changes in the economic environment, competitive pressures, changes in customers tastes and preferences or a significant decrease in gold prices, could materially and adversely affect our profitability and ability to achieve our planned results of operations.\nAchievement of our growth objectives is dependent upon our ability to open and acquire new stores.\nOur expansion strategy includes acquiring existing stores and opening de novo store locations. Our acquisition strategy is dependent upon the availability of attractive acquisition candidates, while the success of our de novo store strategy is contingent upon numerous factors that cannot be predicted or controlled, such as the availability of acceptable locations with a desirable customer base, the negotiation of acceptable lease terms, the ability to obtain required government permits and licenses and the existence of a suitable competitive environment. The achievement of our growth objectives is also subject to our ability to attract, train and retain qualified Team Members. Failure to achieve our expansion goals could adversely affect our prospects, future results of operations and future cash flows.\nWe continue to have limited indemnity obligations to AlphaCredit for pre-closing taxes.\nUnder the terms of the Purchase Agreement related to the sale of our 94%-owned subsidiary, Prestaciones Finmart, S.A.P.I. de C.V., SOFOM, E.N.R. (\"Grupo Finmart\") to Alpha Holding, S.A. de C.V. (AlphaCredit) in September 2016, we remain obligated to indemnify AlphaCredit for any pre-closing taxes (i.e., tax obligations arising from the Grupo Finmart business that are attributable to periods prior to the completion of the sale in September 2016). Those obligations continue until the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the pre-closing periods. In August 2019, AlphaCredit notified us of a potential indemnity claim for certain pre-closing taxes, but the nature, extent and validity of such claim has yet to be determined. The final payments from AlphaCredit totaling $8.0 million were placed into escrow in 2019 pending resolution of the potential indemnity claim.\nThe statute of limitations applicable to most of the pre-closing years has now expired, but AlphaCredit has informed us that they filed an amended return for 2016, which they claim extends the statute of limitations for that year. We were in discussions with AlphaCredit regarding the validity of the indemnity claim, the amount of any continuing exposure and whether some or all of the escrow can now be released. Those discussions have been interrupted due to AlphaCredits recent emergence from a concurso mercantil (insolvency) proceeding in Mexico with new management. The escrowed funds were not impacted by that proceeding, and we are continuing to pursue release of the funds.\nOne person beneficially owns all of our voting stock and generally controls the outcome of all matters requiring a vote of stockholders, which may influence the value of our publicly traded non-voting stock.\nPhillip E. Cohen is the beneficial owner of all our Class B Voting Common Stock, and all our publicly traded stock is non-voting stock. Consequently, stockholders other than Mr. Cohen have no vote with respect to the election of directors or any other matter requiring a vote of stockholders except in limited circumstances as required by law. Further, our Bylaws currently provide that the voting stockholder may appoint or remove officers or take any other action that the Board of Directors may take with respect to officers under the Bylaws. The lack of voting rights may adversely affect the market value of our publicly traded Class A Common Stock.\nMr. Cohen is a member of our Board of Directors and serves as Executive Chairman. As a member of the Board, Mr. Cohen is entitled to vote on all matters requiring approval of the Board. Our Bylaws currently provide that the presence of all directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and that any act of the Board of Directors requires a unanimous approval of all directors. Consequently, Mr. Cohen, as is the case with each of the other directors, has the ability to block actions of the Board. Mr. Cohen has agreed that, as a member of the Board of Directors, he will not participate in any Board vote regarding his position as Executive Chairman.\nWe have a significant firearms business in the U.S., which exposes us to increased risks of regulatory fines and penalties, lawsuits and related liabilities.\nSome of our stores in the U.S. conduct pawn and retail transactions involving firearms, which may be associated with an increased risk of injury and related lawsuits. We may be subject to lawsuits relating to the improper use of firearms that we sell, including actions by persons attempting to recover damages from firearms retailers relating to misuse of firearms. We may also incur fines, penalties or liabilities, or have our federal firearms licenses revoked or suspended, if we fail to properly perform required background checks for, and otherwise record and report, firearms transactions. Any such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.\nOur business is subject to Team Member and third-party robberies, burglaries and other crimes at the store level.\nThe nature of our business requires us to maintain significant cash on hand, loan collateral and inventories in our stores. Consequently, we are subject to loss of cash or merchandise as a result of robberies, burglaries, thefts, riots, looting and other criminal activity in our stores. Further, we could be subject to liability to customers or other third parties as a result of such activities. While we maintain asset protection and monitoring programs to mitigate these risks, as well as insurance programs to protect against catastrophic loss or exposure, there can be no assurance that these crimes will not occur or that such losses will not have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nChanges in competition from various sources could have a material adverse impact on our ability to achieve our plans.\nWe encounter significant competition from other pawn stores, consumer lending companies, other retailers, online retailers and auction sites, many of which have significantly greater financial resources than we do. Increases in the number or size of competitors or other changes in competitive influences, such as aggressive marketing and pricing practices, could adversely affect our operations. In Mexico, we compete directly with certain pawn stores owned and operated by government affiliated or sponsored non-profit foundations, and the government could take actions that would harm our ability to compete in that market.\nOur continued profitability and growth plans are dependent on our ability to successfully design or acquire, deploy and maintain information technology and other business systems to support our current business and our planned growth and expansion.\nThe success of our business depends on the efficiency and reliability of our information technology and business systems and related controls, including the point-of-sale system utilized in our store locations. If access to our technology infrastructure is impaired (as may occur with a computer virus, a cyber attack or other intentional disruption by a third party, natural disaster, telecommunications system failure, electrical system failure or lost connectivity), or if there are flaws in the design or roll-out of new or refreshed technology systems (such as our point-of-sale system), we may be unable to process transactions or otherwise carry on our business in a timely and efficient manner. An infrastructure disruption could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers and revenue. We consider security risks from multiple viewpoints, including physical security as well as security of infrastructure and databases. As our technology infrastructure continues to evolve from on premise to cloud service providers, we continue to assess the security of such infrastructure, including third party service providers.\nWe invested in Cash Converters International Limited for strategic reasons. Law or regulatory changes in Australia or other jurisdictions in which Cash Converters operates, or other factors, could adversely affect Cash Converters operating performance, our share of which would be reflected in our own financial statements due to the equity method of accounting. Further, if that operating performance, or other factors, adversely impact the value of Cash Converters publicly traded stock, then we may be required to impair our investment, as we have done in the past.\nWe own 43.7% of the outstanding ordinary shares of Cash Converters, which is a publicly traded company based in Australia. We made the initial investment in November 2009 and have made incremental investments periodically since then. The success of this strategic investment is dependent on a variety of factors, including Cash Converterss business performance and the markets assessment of that performance.\nIn December 2022, the Australian Parliament passed the Financial Sector Reform Bill 2022, which establishes lending limits on small amount credit contracts. The bill became effective in June 2023, and could adversely impact Cash Converters financial position or results of operations. In response to the new law, Cash Converters recognized a one-time, non-cash impairment expense of AUD $110.5 million against goodwill in their financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2022 and, based upon our 43.7% ownership of Cash Converters at the time, we recorded $32.4 million of our share of their non-cash goodwill impairment charge during the second quarter of our fiscal 2023. Any additional decline in Cash Converters operating results resulting from the change of law or other factors could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe have recorded a number of impairments to the carrying value of our investment in Cash Converters in the past. After an analysis of Cash Converters stock price performance and other factors, we determined the fair value of our investment in Cash Converters at September 30, 2023 was greater than its carrying value. See Note 5: Strategic Investments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplemental Data. If the fair value of our investment declines and we determine that such decline is other-than-temporary, we may be required to further impair our investment and recognize the related investment loss, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial position in the period of impairment. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose of some or all of our investment in Cash Converters on favorable terms, should we decide to do so in the future.\nOur ability to recover our investments in other companies (such as our indirect investment in Simple Management Group, Inc. and our investment in Rich Data Corporation) is heavily dependent on the success and performance of those companies, including their respective ability to obtain further debt or equity financing.\nWe have certain investments in other companies. See Note 1: Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Investments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplemental Data. Our ability to recover our investment in these companies is heavily dependent on their success and performance, potentially including their ability to obtain further debt or equity financing. To the extent that any of such companies is not successful, we may be required in future periods to impair our investment and recognize related investment losses.\nWe may incur property, casualty or other losses, including losses related to natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and volcanoes. Not all such losses will be covered by insurance.\nWe maintain a program of insurance coverage for various types of property, casualty and other risks. The types and amounts of insurance that we obtain vary from time to time, depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. The policies are subject to deductibles and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a self-insurance basis. Losses not covered by insurance could be substantial and may increase our expenses, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have significant operations located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes (notably the Atlantic and Gulf Coast regions of Florida, the Gulf Coast regions of Texas including Houston, as well as Mexico and Central America). Certain areas of our operations are also susceptible to other types of natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanoes and tornadoes. As noted above, not all physical damage that we incur as a result of any such natural disaster will be covered by insurance due to policy deductibles and risk retentions. In addition, natural disasters could have a significant negative impact on our business beyond physical damage to property, including a reduction of our PLO, inventory, pawn service charges and merchandise sales. Only limited portions, if any, of those negative impacts will be covered by applicable business interruption insurance policies. As a result, geographically isolated natural disasters could have a material adverse effect on our overall operations and financial performance.\nGoodwill comprises a significant portion of our total assets. We assess goodwill for impairment at least annually, which could result in a material, non-cash write-down and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions.\nThe carrying value of our goodwill was $302.4 million, or approximately 21% of our total assets, as of September 30, 2023. We test goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life for potential impairment annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, a change in strategic direction, legal factors, operating performance indicators, a change in the competitive environment, the sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit, or future economic factors such as unfavorable changes in the estimated future discounted cash flows of our reporting units.\nWhen performing our annual test of goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine an impairment is more-likely-than-not, we are then required to perform a quantitative impairment test; otherwise, no further analysis is required. We also may elect not to perform a qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to a quantitative impairment test. When performing a quantitative impairment test, we apply a one-step quantitative test and record the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting units carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nWhen we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach based on the present value of expected future cash flows, including terminal value, utilizing a market-based weighted average cost of capital (WACC) determined separately for each reporting unit. The determination of fair value involves the use of estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates, operating margins and terminal growth rates discounted by an estimated WACC derived from other publicly traded companies that are similar but not identical to us from an operational and economic standpoint. We use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainties inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts.\nSee Note 1: Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 8: Goodwill and Intangible Assets of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplemental Data for a discussion of our annual impairment tests performed for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nThe conversion feature of our convertible notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWe have outstanding a total of $367.8 million of convertible notes. See Note 9: Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. If the conversion feature of any of those convertible notes is triggered, holders will be entitled to convert the notes at their option at any time during specified periods. If one or more holders elect to convert their notes, we may be required, or may choose, to settle the obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the convertible notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nConversion of our convertible notes into stock may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our Class A Common Stock.\nIf it were to occur, the conversion of convertible notes would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares of Class A Common Stock upon conversion. Any sales in the public market of such shares could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Class A Common Stock. In addition, the existence of the convertible notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of such notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the notes into shares of our Class A Common Stock could depress the price of our Class A Common Stock.\nWe have a limited number of unreserved shares available for future issuance, which may limit our ability to conduct future financings and other transactions and our ability to offer equity awards to management.\nOur certificate of incorporation currently authorizes us to issue up to 100 million shares of Class A Common Stock. Taking into consideration the shares that are issued and outstanding, as well as the shares that have been reserved for issuance pursuant to convertible notes, outstanding equity incentive compensation awards and the conversion of the Class B Common Stock, we had approximately 3.0 million shares of authorized Class A Common Stock available for other uses as of September 30, 2023. We expect that number will be reduced to 2.1 million following the issuance of currently approved Long-Term Incentive awards in November 2023. Therefore, our ability to issue shares of Class A Common Stock (other than pursuant to the existing reserved-for commitments), or securities or instruments that are convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Class A Common Stock, may be limited until such time additional authorized, unissued and unreserved shares become available or unless we determine we are unlikely to issue all of the shares that are currently reserved. During this time, for example, our ability to complete equity or equity-linked financings or other transactions (including strategic acquisitions) that involve the issuance or potential issuance of Class A Common Stock may be limited. Further, our ability to offer equity-based compensation to our management team may also be limited, which could adversely affect our ability to align managements incentives with stockholders or attract and retain key management personnel.\nGeneral Risks\nPublic health issues could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nOur business may be impacted by public health issues, such as COVID-19, other pandemics and the spread of contagious diseases. Such public health issues, and the government and consumer responses thereto, may (i) limit our ability to supply products and services to our customers as a result of store closures, reduced access to or foot traffic in our stores, or labor shortages, (ii) adversely affect the demand for our products and services or (iii) cause other unforeseen negative developments. Any of these factors may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nWe have significant operations in Latin America, and changes in the business, regulatory, political or social climate could impact our operations there, which could adversely affect our results of operations and growth plans.\nWe own and operate a significant number of pawn stores in Latin America (primarily Mexico, but also Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras). Further, our growth plans include potential expansion in some of those countries as well as potentially other countries in Latin America. Doing business in those countries exposes us to risks related to political instability, corruption, economic volatility, drug cartel and gang-related violence, social unrest including riots and looting, tax and foreign investment policies, public safety and security concerns, and uncertain application of laws and regulations. Consequently, actions or events in any of those countries that are beyond our control could restrict our ability to operate there or otherwise adversely affect the profitability of those operations. Furthermore, changes in the business, regulatory or political climate in any of those countries, or significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates, could affect our ability to expand or continue our operations there, which could have a material adverse impact on our prospects, results of operations and cash flows. For a description of the current regulatory environment in the Latin American countries in which we operate, see Mexico Regulations and Other Latin America Regulations under Part I, Item 1 - Business - Regulation.\nA significant change in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and financial position.\nWe have foreign operations in Latin America (primarily Mexico, but also Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras) and an equity investment in Australia. Our assets and investments in, and earnings and dividends from each of these countries must be translated to U.S. dollars from their respective functional currencies. A significant weakening of any of these foreign currencies could result in lower assets and earnings in U.S. dollars, resulting in a potentially material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nLitigation and regulatory proceedings could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe are currently subject to various litigation and regulatory actions, and additional actions could arise in the future. Potential actions range from claims and assertions arising in the ordinary course of business (such as contract, customer or employment disputes) to more significant corporate-level matters or shareholder litigation. All of these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur, which could include monetary damages, fines and penalties or other relief. Any unfavorable ruling or outcome could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or could negatively affect our reputation.\nUnder our certificate of incorporation, we are generally obligated to indemnify our directors and officers for costs and liabilities they incur in their capacity as directors or officers of the Company. Consequently, if a proceeding names or involves any of our directors or officers, then (subject to certain exceptions) we are generally obligated to pay or reimburse the cost or liability such director or officer incurs as a result of such proceeding (including defense costs, judgments and amounts paid in settlement). We maintain management liability insurance that protects us from much of this potential indemnification exposure, as well as potential costs or liabilities that may be directly incurred by the Company in some cases. However, our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles and there may be elements of the costs or liabilities that are not covered under the insurance policies. In addition, to the extent our ultimate liability in any such proceeding (or any combination of proceedings that are included in the same policy year) exceeds the management liability policy limits, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur acquisitions, investments and other transactions could disrupt our ongoing business and harm our results of operations.\nIn pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, investments and other transactions. These transactions may involve significant challenges and risks, including risks that we may not realize the expected return on an acquisition or investment, that we may not be able to retain key personnel of an acquired business, or that we may experience difficulty in integrating acquired businesses into our business systems and processes. If we do enter into agreements with respect to acquisitions, investments or other transactions, we may fail to complete them due to inability to obtain required regulatory or other approvals or other factors. Furthermore, acquisitions, investments and other transactions require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business, and there are inherent risks in integrating and operating any acquired business. These factors could harm our business and results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and other general business laws and regulations, and any determination that we violated these laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to various anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the U.S. and the General Law of Administrative Responsibility in Mexico. We are also subject to various laws and regulations designed to prevent money laundering or the financial support of terrorism or other illegal activity, including the USA PATRIOT Act and the Bank Secrecy Act in the U.S. and The Federal Law for the Prevention and Identification of Transactions with Funds From Illegal Sources in Mexico. See Part I, Item 1 - Business - Regulation. Further, our business is expanding in countries and regions that are less developed and are generally recognized as potentially more corrupt business and political environments.\nWhile we maintain controls and policies to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, these controls and policies may prove to be less than effective. If Team Members, agents or other persons for whose conduct we are held responsible violate our policies, we may be subject to severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties, and we may be subject to other liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in our liquidity and capital requirements or in access to capital markets or other financing and transactional banking sources could limit our ability to achieve our plans.\nA significant reduction in cash flows from operations or the availability of debt or equity financing could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results. Our ability to obtain debt or equity financing, including the possible refinancing of existing indebtedness, will depend upon market conditions, our financial condition and the willingness of financing sources to make capital available to us at acceptable rates and terms. The inability to access capital at acceptable rates and terms could restrict or limit our ability to achieve our growth objectives, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur access to transactional banking services, as well as international wire services between certain countries, is an ongoing business requirement. Inability in accessing or maintaining transactional banking or wire services could lead to increased costs or the inability to efficiently manage our cash as we would be required to seek alternative banking services or obtain services from several regional or local retail banks.\nWe collect and store a variety of sensitive customer information, and breaches in data security or other cyber-attacks could harm our business operations and lead to reputational damage.\nIn the course of conducting our business, we collect and store on our information technology systems a variety of information about our customers, including sensitive personal identifying and financial information. We may not have the resources or technical expertise to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber attacks. Attacks may be targeted at us, our service providers, our customers or others who have entrusted us with information. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increased costs, including costs to hire additional personnel, purchase additional protection technologies, train Team Members and engage third-party experts and consultants. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries or other developments may result in the technology we use to protect data being breached or compromised. In addition, data and security breaches can occur as a result of non-technical issues, including breach by us or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. We could be subject to fines, penalties and liabilities if any such information is misappropriated from our systems or we otherwise fail to maintain the security and confidentiality of such information. Further, any such data security breach could cause damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in our data security measures, which could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nWe may face business interruptions or other adverse effects on our operations and growth.\nOur business and operations could be subject to interruption or damage due to inclement weather, natural disaster, power loss, acts of violence, terrorist attacks, war, civil unrest or similar events. Further, we may experience information technology or other business systems disruptions. Such events could impair our customers' access to our business, impact our ability to expand or continue our operations or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe face other risks discussed under Part II, Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nWe lease our pawn store locations, which are located throughout our geographic areas of operations. See Part I, Item 1 - Business - Segment and Geographic Information. Our pawn stores are typically located in a freestanding building or occupy all or part of a retail strip center with contiguous parking. A portion of the store interior is designed for retail operations, with merchandise displayed for sale by category. Distinctive exterior design and attractive in-store signage provide an appealing atmosphere to customers. We maintain or reimburse our landlords for maintaining property and general liability insurance for each of our stores. Our stores are open six or seven days a week.\nLeases for our U.S. locations generally have initial terms ranging from three to 10 years and typically allow for renewals in increments of three-to-five years. Our primary corporate office is located in Austin, Texas and is leased through March 2029 with escalating rent payments annually and includes two five-year extension options at the end of the lease term. Our locations in Latin America are generally leased on three-to-five year terms.\nOur existing leases expire on various dates through fiscal 2033, with a small number of leases on month-to-month terms. All leases provide for specified periodic rental payments at market rates. Most leases require us to maintain the property and pay the cost of insurance and taxes. We believe the termination of any one of our leases would not have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our strategy generally is to lease rather than own space for our stores. On an ongoing basis, we may close or consolidate under-performing store locations.\nAs of September 30, 2023, we had a total of 1,231 stores, 529 of which are located in the U.S., with 45% located in Texas, 17% in Florida and the remainder spread across 17 other states. We also have 549 locations in Mexico, 117 in Guatemala, 18 in El Salvador, and 18 in Honduras.\nIn addition to our store leases, we lease approximately 120,000 square feet of corporate office space in Austin, Texas (82,663 square feet of which is being subleased or made available for sublease to other tenants). We lease other corporate office space in Mexico (8,600 square feet), Guatemala (3,500 square feet), El Salvador (4,500 square feet) and Honduras (1,200 square feet).\nFor additional information about store locations, see Part I, Item 1 - Business - Segment and Geographic Information.

[RESERVED] ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to inform the reader about matters affecting the financial condition and results of operations of EZCORP, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, we, us, our or the Company) for the two-year period ended September 30, 2023. The following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, and our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. See Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Regarding Risks and Uncertainties That May Affect Future Results below.\nResults of Operations\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we provide certain other non-GAAP financial information on a constant currency basis (constant currency) and same store basis. We use constant currency results to evaluate our Latin America Pawn operations, which are denominated primarily in Mexican pesos, Guatemalan quetzales and other Latin American currencies. We analyze results on a same store basis (which is defined as stores open during the entirety of the comparable periods) to better understand existing store performance without the influence of increases or decreases resulting solely from changes in store count. We believe presentation of constant currency and same store results is meaningful and useful in understanding the activities and business metrics of our Latin America Pawn operations (in the case of constant currency) and our store operations (in the case of same store results) and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our business that, when viewed with GAAP results, provide a better understanding and evaluation of factors and trends affecting our business. We provide non-GAAP financial information for informational purposes and to enhance understanding of our GAAP consolidated financial statements. We use this non-GAAP financial information to evaluate and compare operating results across accounting periods. Readers should consider the information in addition to, but not rather than or superior to, our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\nConstant currency results reported herein are calculated by translating consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations items denominated in local currency to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate from the prior-year comparable period, as opposed to the current period, in order to exclude the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations. We used the end-of-period rate for balance sheet items and the average closing daily exchange rate on a monthly basis during the appropriate period for statement of operations items. Our statement of operations constant currency results reflect the monthly exchange rate fluctuations and are not directly calculable from the rates below. Constant currency results, where presented, also exclude the foreign currency gain or loss. The end-of-period and approximate average exchange rates for each applicable currency as compared to U.S. dollars as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nSeptember 30, Twelve Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nMexican peso 17.4 20.1 18.3 20.4\nGuatemalan quetzal 7.7 7.6 7.6 7.5\nHonduran lempira 24.5 24.1 24.3 24.1\nAustralian dollar 1.6 1.6 1.5 1.4\nOperating Results\nFiscal 2023 vs. Fiscal 2022\nThese tables, as well as the discussion that follows, should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nSummary Financial Data\nThe following table presents selected summary consolidated financial data for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022.\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 30, Change\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nGross profit:\nPawn service charges $ 383,772 $ 320,865 20%\nMerchandise sales 615,446 532,886 15%\nMerchandise sales gross profit 220,667 203,504 8%\nGross margin on merchandise sales 36 % 38 % (200) bps\nJewelry scrapping sales 49,528 32,033 55%\nJewelry scrapping gross profit 5,104 3,337 53%\nGross margin on jewelry scrapping sales 10 % 10 % 0 bps\nOther revenues, net 295 441 (33)%\nGross profit 609,838 528,147 15%\nStore expenses 418,574 357,417 17%\nGeneral and administrative 67,529 64,342 5%\nImpairment of goodwill, intangible and other assets 4,343 - *\nDepreciation and Amortization 32,131 32,140 -%\nLoss (gain) on sale or disposal of assets and other 208 (674) (131)%\nOther income (5,097) - *\nTotal operating expenses 517,688 453,225 14%\nInterest expense 16,456 9,972 65%\nInterest income (7,470) (817) *\nEquity in net loss (income) of unconsolidated affiliates 28,459 (1,779) *\nOther expense (income) 3,072 (167) *\nTotal non-operating expenses 40,517 7,209 462%\nIncome before income taxes 51,633 67,713 (24)%\nIncome tax expense 13,170 17,553 (25)%\nNet income $ 38,463 $ 50,160 (23)%\nNet pawn earning assets:\nPawn loans $ 245,766 $ 210,009 17%\nInventory, net 166,477 151,615 10%\nTotal net pawn earning assets $ 412,243 $ 361,624 14%\n* Represents a percentage computation that is not mathematically meaningful.\nPawn loans outstanding (PLO) increased $35.8 million (17%) to $245.8 million due to improved operational performance and continued strong pawn demand.\nTotal revenues increased $162.8 million (18%) and gross profit increased 15%, reflecting improved pawn service charge (PSC) revenue, merchandise sales and merchandise sales gross profit.\nPSC increased $62.9 million (20%) as a result of higher average PLO and yields. Merchandise sales increased $82.6 million (15%), driven primarily by our continued focus on customer engagement, pricing merchandise to maintain strong inventory turnover and an increase in stores. Merchandise sales gross margin remains within our targeted range at 36%.\nOperating expenses increased $64.5 million (14%) primarily due to (a) a $61.2 million increase in store expenses as a result of increased labor in-line with store activity, higher store count and, to a lesser extent, expenses related to our loyalty program and (b) a $3.2 million increase in general and administrative expenses primarily due to an increase in costs related to incentive compensation, insurance and our Workday implementation, partially offset by the litigation accrual charge of $2.0 million recorded in the prior period.\nTotal non-operating expenses increased $33.3 million (462%), primarily due to the net loss on our share of losses in Cash Converters net results related to their non-cash goodwill impairment charge and interest expense. Interest expense increased $6.5 million, primarily driven by the net loss recorded on the partial extinguishments of the 2024 convertible notes and 2025 convertible notes, and higher average total debt outstanding at overall higher average effective interest rates due to the issuance of the 2029 convertible notes in December 2022. See Note 9: Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplemental Data for further discussion.\nIncome tax expense decreased $4.4 million primarily due to the decrease in income before income taxes of $16.1 million, offset by an increase in tax expense for the non-deductible loss realized on the refinancing of the convertible notes in the current year. Income tax expense includes other items that do not necessarily correspond to pre-tax earnings and create volatility in our effective tax rate. These items include the net effect of state taxes, non-deductible items and changes in valuation allowances for certain foreign operations. See Note 11: Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplemental Data for quantification of these items.\nU.S. Pawn\nThe following table presents selected summary financial data from our U.S. Pawn segment:\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 30, Change\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nGross profit:\nPawn service charges $ 285,919 $ 240,982 19%\nMerchandise sales 432,578 391,958 10%\nMerchandise sales gross profit 164,704 161,717 2%\nGross margin on merchandise sales 38 % 41 % (300) bps\nJewelry scrapping sales 43,305 25,739 68%\nJewelry scrapping sales gross profit 5,596 2,984 88%\nGross margin on jewelry scrapping sales 13 % 12 % 100 bps\nOther revenues 119 83 43%\nGross profit 456,338 405,766 12%\nSegment operating expenses:\nStore expenses 299,319 266,114 12%\nDepreciation and amortization 10,382 10,552 (2)%\nLoss on sale or disposal of assets and other 115 51 125%\nSegment operating contribution 146,522 129,049 14%\nOther segment income (2) (2) -%\nSegment contribution $ 146,524 $ 129,051 14%\nOther data:\nAverage monthly ending pawn loan balance per store (a) $ 327 $ 287 14%\nMonthly average yield on pawn loans outstanding 14 % 13 % 100 bps\nPawn collateral - general merchandise 34 % 36 % (6)%\nPawn collateral - jewelry 66 % 64 % 3%\n(a) Balance is calculated based on the average of the monthly ending balance averages during the applicable period.\nPLO continued to increase, ending the year at $190.6 million, up 17% in total and 13% on a same store basis due to improved customer service and increased pawn demand.\nTotal revenues increased 16% and gross profit increased 12%, primarily due to increased PSC.\nPSC increased 19% as a result of higher average PLO and yields.\nMerchandise sales increased 10%, primarily driven by our continued focus on customer engagement and pricing merchandise to maintain strong inventory turnover. Offsetting the sales increase, merchandise sales gross margin decreased 300 bps to 38%, reflecting a return to normalized margins.\nStore expenses increased 12% (10% on a same store basis), primarily due to increased labor in-line with store activity, higher store count and, to a lesser extent, expenses related to our loyalty program.\nSegment contribution increased $17.5 million due to the changes described above.\nDuring fiscal 2023, segment net store count in our U.S. pawn segment increased by 14 due to the acquisition of 12 stores, the opening of 3 de novo stores and the consolidation of 1 store.\nLatin America Pawn\nThe following table presents selected summary financial data from our Latin America Pawn segment, including constant currency results, after translation to U.S. dollars from functional currencies.

On a same store basis, PLO increased 16% (4% on a constant currency basis) as consumer demand increased.\nTotal revenues were up 26% (16% on a constant currency basis), while gross profit increased by 25% (16% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to increased PSC, higher merchandise sales and improved gross profit.\nPSC increased 22% (13% on constant currency basis) as a result of higher average PLO and yields.\nMerchandise sales increased 30% (19% on a constant currency basis) and 24% on a same store basis (14% on a constant currency basis). Merchandise sales increase was driven primarily by our continued focus on customer engagement, pricing merchandise to maintain strong inventory turnover and increase in stores. Merchandise sales gross margin increased 100 bps to 31%, within our target range.\nStore expenses increased $28.0 million, up 31% (20% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to increases in minimum wage and headcount, higher store count and, to a lesser extent, expenses related to our loyalty program and rent. Same-store expenses increased 26% (15% on a constant currency basis).\nSegment contribution was up 32% to $31.7 million (24% on a constant currency basis). This increase was primarily due to the reversal of contingent consideration liability in connection with a previously completed acquisition, which was recorded to Other income, and the changes in revenue and store expenses described above.\nDuring fiscal 2023, net store count in our Latin America pawn segment increased by 42 due to the opening of 44 de novo stores and the consolidation of 2 stores.\nOther Investments and Cash Converters\nThe following table presents selected summary financial data for our Other Investments and Cash Converters segments after translation to U.S. dollars from its functional currency of primarily Australian dollars:\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 30, Change\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nGross profit:\nConsumer loan fees and interest $ 55 $ 111 (50)%\nGross profit 55 111 (50)%\nSegment operating expenses:\nInterest income (1,500) - 100%\nEquity in net loss (income) of unconsolidated affiliates 28,459 (1,779) *\nSegment operating (loss) contribution (26,904) 1,890 *\nOther segment loss 31 52 (40)%\nSegment (loss) contribution $ (26,935) $ 1,838 *\n* Represents a percentage computation that is not mathematically meaningful.\nSegment loss was $26.9 million, a decrease of $28.8 million, primarily due to the net loss on our share of Cash Converters net results related to their non-cash goodwill impairment charge.\nOther Items\nThe following table reconciles our consolidated segment contribution discussed above to net income, including items that affect our consolidated financial results but are not allocated among segments:\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 30, Change\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nSegment contribution $ 151,247 $ 154,943 (2)%\nCorporate expenses (income):\nGeneral and administrative 67,532 64,342 5%\nImpairment of goodwill and intangibles 4,343 - *\nDepreciation and amortization 12,558 13,675 (8)%\nLoss (gain) on sale or disposal of assets and other 382 (688) (156)%\nInterest expense 16,456 9,972 65%\nInterest income (4,829) - *\nOther expense (income) 3,172 (71) *\nIncome before income taxes 51,633 67,713 24%\nIncome tax expense 13,170 17,553 25%\nNet income $ 38,463 $ 50,160 23%\n* Represents a percentage computation that is not mathematically meaningful.\nSegment contribution decreased $3.7 million or 2%, primarily due to the net loss on our share of losses in Cash Converterss net results related to their non-cash goodwill impairment charge, partially offset by the improved operating results of the segments above.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $3.2 million (5%), primarily due to the impact related to the reversal of incentive compensation for the departed CEO in the prior year and to a lesser extent, an overall increase in incentive-based compensation, and costs primarily related to our Workday implementation, partially offset by the litigation accrual charge of $2.0 million recorded in the prior period.\nInterest expense increased $6.5 million (65%), primarily driven by the net loss recorded on the partial extinguishments of the 2024 convertible notes and 2025 convertible notes, and higher average total debt outstanding at overall higher average effective interest rates due to the issuance of the 2029 convertible notes during December 2022. See Note 9: Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplemental Data for further discussion.\nInterest income increased $4.8 million, due primarily to our treasury management with increased market interest rates.\nIncome tax expense decreased $4.4 million primarily due to a decrease in income before income taxes of $16.1 million, offset by an increase in tax expense for the non-deductible loss realized on the refinancing of the convertible notes in the current year. Income tax expense includes other items that do not necessarily correspond to pre-tax earnings and create volatility in our effective tax rate. These items include the net effect of state taxes, non-deductible items and changes in valuation allowances for certain foreign operations. See Note 11: Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplemental Data for quantification of these items.\nFiscal 2022 vs. Fiscal 2021\nThe Results of Operations discussion for fiscal 2022 vs. fiscal 2021 is located in Part II, Item 7 - Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nOur cash and equivalents balance was $220.6 million at September 30, 2023 compared to $206.0 million at September 30, 2022. Our cash and equivalents were held in cash depository accounts with major banks or invested in high quality, short-term liquid investments.\nCash Flows\nThe table and discussion below present a summary of the sources and uses of our cash:\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 30,\nChange\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nCash flows provided by operating activities $ 101,834 $ 66,535 53%\nCash flows used in investing activities (110,886) (113,283) (2)%\nCash flows provided by (used in) financing activities 23,692 (2,832) *\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (41) 325 (113)%\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 14,599 $ (49,255) 130%\n* Represents a percentage computation that is not mathematically meaningful.\nThe $35.3 million increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in net income (when considering adjustments for non-cash items affecting net income) as well as changes in working capital primarily related to the timing of payments of income taxes, inventory, prepaid expenses and accounts payable.\nThe $2.4 million decrease in cash flows used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase of $33.4 million in net pawn lending outflows and a $29.8 million net increase in cash flows used to fund acquisitions, strategic investments and capital expenditures, the largest of which is $15.0 million related to a note receivable from Founders, as discussed in Note 5: Strategic Investments in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplemental Data. These were offset by a $61.9 million increase in cash inflows from the sale of forfeited collateral.\nThe $26.5 million increase in cash flows provided by financing activities was primarily related to the December 2022 financing of the 2029 Convertible Notes, in which we issued $230.0 million principal amount of 3.750% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2029 offset by the extinguishment of approximately $109.4 million aggregate principal amount of our 2024 Convertible Notes for approximately $117.5 million plus accrued interest and approximately $69.1 million aggregate principal amount of our 2025 Convertible Notes for approximately $62.9 million plus accrued interest. In addition, we used approximately $5.0 million of the net proceeds from the 2029 Convertible Notes offering to repurchase 578,703 shares of our Class A common stock from purchasers of the notes in privately negotiated transactions. Further, the Company repurchased and retired 1,389,102 shares of our Class A Common Stock for $12.0 million under the Common Stock Repurchase Program during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.\nThe net effect of these changes was a $14.6 million increase in cash on hand during the current year, resulting in a $229.0 million ending cash and restricted cash balance.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nIn December 2022, we issued $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2029 Convertible Notes. In conjunction with the issuance of the 2029 Convertible Notes, we extinguished approximately $109.4 million aggregate principal amount of our 2024 Convertible Notes for approximately $117.5 million plus accrued interest and approximately $69.1 million aggregate principal amount of our 2025 Convertible Notes for approximately $62.9 million plus accrued interest. In addition, we used approximately $5.0 million of the net proceeds from the 2029 Convertible Notes offering to repurchase 578,703 shares of our Class A common stock from purchasers of the notes in privately negotiated transactions. See Note 9: Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplemental Data. The shares repurchased in conjunction with the transactions discussed above were authorized separately from, and not considered part of, the publicly announced share repurchase program referred to below.\nIn May 2022, our Board of Directors (the Board) authorized the repurchase of up to $50 million of our Class A Common Stock over 3 years. Execution of the program will be responsive to fluctuating market conditions and valuations, liquidity needs and the expected return on investment compared to other opportunities.\nThe amount and timing of purchases will be dependent on a variety of factors, including stock price, trading volume, general market conditions, legal and regulatory requirements, general business conditions, the level of cash flows, and corporate considerations determined by management and the Board, such as liquidity and capital needs and the availability of attractive alternative investment opportunities. The Board has reserved the right to modify, suspend or terminate the program at any time. Through September 30, 2023, we have repurchased and retired 1,627,045 shares of our Class A Common Stock for $14.0 million, which amount was allocated between Additional paid-in capital and Retained earnings in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe anticipate that cash flows from operations and cash on hand will be adequate to fund ongoing operations, deb service requirements, tax payments, any future stock repurchases, strategic investments, our contractual obligations, planned de novo store growth, capital expenditures and working capital requirements through fiscal 2024. We continue to explore acquisition opportunities, both large and small, and may choose to pursue additional debt, equity or equity-linked financings in the future should the need arise. Depending on the level of acquisition activity and other factors, our ability to repay our longer term debt obligations, including the convertible debt maturing in 2024, 2025 and 2029, may require us to refinance these obligations through the issuance of new debt securities, equity securities, convertible securities or through new credit facilities.\nConvertible Notes\nFor a description of the terms of our convertible notes, including the associated conversion and other related features and transactions, see Note 9: Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplemental Data.\nContractual Obligations\nBelow is a summary of our cash needs to meet future aggregate contractual obligations as of September 30, 2023:\nPayments due by Period\n(in thousands) Total Less than\n1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than\n5 years\nDebt obligations (a) $ 367,762 $ 34,389 $ 103,373 $ - $ 230,000\nInterest on long-term debt obligations 58,535 11,822 18,682 17,250 10,781\nLease obligations (b) 310,275 76,290 124,035 69,358 40,592\nTotal (c) (d) $ 736,572 $ 122,501 $ 246,090 $ 86,608 $ 281,373\n(a) Excludes debt discount and deferred financing costs as well as convertible features.\n(b) Excludes $6.7 million in sublease payments expected to be received.\n(c) No provision for uncertain tax benefits has been reflected in the contractual obligations table as the timing of any such payment is uncertain. See Note 11: Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplemental Data. Additionally, no provision for insurance reserves, deferred compensation arrangements, or other liabilities totaling $6.6 million has been included as the timing of such payments are uncertain.\n(d) Total excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as current liabilities, except for the accrued portions of interest and lease obligations which are included in interest on long-term debt obligations and lease obligations captions above.\nIn addition to the lease obligations in the table above, we are responsible for the maintenance, property taxes and insurance at most of our locations. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, these collectively amounted to $16.3 million.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments including those related to revenue recognition, inventory, loan loss allowances, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, long-lived and other intangible assets, income taxes, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience, observable trends and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We use this information to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from the estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe critical accounting policies and estimates that could have a significant impact on our results of operations, as well as relevant recent accounting pronouncements, are described in Note 1: Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplemental Data. Certain accounting policies regarding the quantification of the sensitivity of certain critical estimates are discussed further below.\nPawn Loan Revenue Recognition\nWe record PSC using the effective interest method over the life of the loan for all pawn loans we believe to be collectible. We base our estimate of collectible loans on several inputs, including recent redemption rates, historical trends in redemption rates and the amount of loans due in the following months. Unexpected variations in any of these factors could change our estimate of collectible loans, affecting our earnings and financial condition. As of September 30, 2023, the balance of our PSC receivable was $38.9 million. Assuming the average forfeiture rate increased or decreased by 10%, our pawn service charges receivable balance as of September 30, 2023 would have increased or decreased by approximately $1.2 million.\nInventory and Cost of Goods Sold\nWe consider our estimates of obsolete or slow-moving inventory and shrinkage in determining the appropriate overall valuation allowance for inventory. We monitor our sales margins for each type of inventory on an ongoing basis and compare to historical margins. Significant variances in those margins may require a revision to future inventory reserve estimates. We have historically revised our reserve pertaining to jewelry inventory depending on the current price of gold and resulting trends in margins. Future declines in gold prices may cause an increase in reserve rates pertaining to jewelry inventory. As of September 30, 2023, the gross balance of our inventory was $169.1 million, for which we have included reserves of $2.7 million. Assuming the reserve rates were increased or decreased by 10%, our inventory reserve balance as of September 30, 2023 would have increased or decreased by approximately $0.3 million.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nWhen testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine an impairment is more-likely-than-not, we are then required to perform a quantitative impairment test; otherwise, no further analysis is required. We also may elect not to perform a qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to a quantitative impairment test. When performing a quantitative impairment test, we apply a one-step quantitative test and record the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting units carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nWhen we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach based on the present value of expected future cash flows, including terminal value, utilizing a market-based weighted average cost of capital (WACC) determined separately for each reporting unit. The determination of fair value involves the use of estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates, operating margins and terminal growth rates discounted by an estimated WACC derived from other publicly traded companies that are similar but not identical to us from an operational and economic standpoint. We use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainties inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts.\nWe test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. If we believe as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required.\nWe consider the assessment of the occurrence of triggering events or substantive changes in circumstances that may indicate the fair value of goodwill may be impaired to be a critical estimate. Furthermore, we consider the assumptions discussed above pertaining to the income approach we use in the quantitative testing of impairment to be critical estimates.\nThe results of the impairment analyses for fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2022 are discussed in Note 8: Goodwill and Intangible Assets of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplemental Data.\nIncome Taxes\nManagement believes that it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the net recorded deferred tax assets. In the event we determine all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. We have included valuation allowances against deferred tax assets for net operating losses and tax credits not expected to be utilized based on specific facts and estimates for each jurisdiction.\nWe consider the earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the U.S. on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs and our specific plans for reinvestment of those subsidiary earnings. We have not recorded a deferred tax liability related to foreign withholding taxes of our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the U.S.\nWe may be subject to income tax audits by the respective tax authorities in any or all of the jurisdictions in which we operate or have operated within a relevant period. Significant judgment is required in determining uncertain tax positions. We utilize the required two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of an audit or the refinement of an estimate. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. We believe adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all periods.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Risks and Uncertainties That May Affect Future Results\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We intend that all forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created by these laws. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, regarding our strategy, future operations, financial position, future revenues, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives are forward-looking statements. The words may, \"can,\" should, could, will, \"would,\" predict, anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, plan, project and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Such statements are only predictions of the outcome and timing of future events based on our current expectations and currently available information.

Accordingly, you should not regard any forward-looking statement as a representation that the expected results will be achieved. When considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements in this report. Such risks and uncertainties include, among other things:\nChanges in laws and regulations;\nNegative characterizations of our industry;\nConcentration of business in Texas and Florida;\nChanges in gold prices or volumes;\nChanges in sales, pawn loan balances, sales margins, pawn redemption rates or other important operating metrics;\nOur ability to continue growing our store count through acquisitions and de novo openings;\nContinuing indemnification obligations for pre-closing taxes related to our sale of Grupo Finmart;\nOur controlled ownership structure;\nPotential regulatory fines and penalties, lawsuits and related liabilities related to firearms business;\nPotential robberies, burglaries and other crimes at our stores;\nChanges in the competitive landscape;\nOur ability to design or acquire, deploy and maintain adequate information technology and other business systems;\nFailure to achieve adequate return on investments;\nPotential uninsured property, casualty or other losses;\nPotential natural disasters;\nFinancial statement impact of potential impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets such as trade names;\nPotential conversion of Convertible Notes into cash (which could adversely affect liquidity) or stock (which will cause dilution of existing stockholders);\nLimited number of unreserved shares available for future issuance;\nPublic health issues that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations;\nChanges in the business, regulatory, political or social climate in Latin America;\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\nThe outcome of future litigation and regulatory proceedings;\nPotential disruptive effect of acquisitions, investments and new businesses;\nPotential exposure under anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and other general business laws and regulations;\nChanges in liquidity, capital requirements or access to debt and capital markets;\nPotential data security breaches or other cyber-attacks; and\nPotential civil unrest or government overthrow and other events beyond our control.\nFor a discussion of these important risk factors, see Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors.\nIn addition, we cannot predict all of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Although forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not regard any forward-looking statements as a representation that the expected results will be achieved.\nWe specifically disclaim any responsibility to publicly update any information contained in a forward-looking statement except as required by law. All forward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket Risk Disclosures\nWe are exposed to market risk related primarily to gold values and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nOur earnings and financial position are affected by changes in gold values, and to a lesser extent silver and precious stone values, and the resulting impact on pawn lending, jewelry sales and jewelry cost of goods sold. The proceeds of scrap sales and our ability to sell jewelry inventory at an acceptable margin depend on gold values. The impact on our financial position and results of operations of a hypothetical change in gold values cannot be reasonably estimated due to the timing of scrap sales, among other operational considerations.\nOur earnings and financial position are affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to our equity investments and our operations outside the U.S. While we generally do not seek to hedge amounts in foreign currencies, we consider hedging strategies from time to time to mitigate certain discrete risks of exposure via short term arrangements.\nThe translation adjustment from Cash Converters through June 30, 2023 (included in our September 30, 2023 results on a three-month lag) was a $4.4 million increase to stockholders equity, excluding income tax impacts. As of September 30, 2023, $1.00 Australian dollar was essentially flat at $0.6452 U.S. as compared to $0.6480 in the prior year.\nThe translation adjustment from Latin America primarily representing the change of the Mexican peso during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 was a $20.9 million increase to stockholders equity. As of September 30, 2023, the Mexican peso strengthened approximately 16% to $1.00 Mexican to $0.0574 U.S. from $0.0495 U.S. as of September 30, 2022. As of September 30, 2023, the Guatemalan quetzal strengthened approximately 5% Q1.00 Guatemalan to $0.1302 U.S. from $0.1243 U.S. as of September 30, 2022. We have currently assumed indefinite reinvestment of earnings and capital in Latin America. Accumulated translation gains or losses related to any future repatriation of earnings or capital would impact our earnings in the period of repatriation.\nTo a lesser degree, our operations are affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Honduran lempira.\nWe cannot predict the future valuation of foreign currencies or how further movements in exchange rates could affect our future earnings or financial position due to the interrelationship of operating results and exchange rates.

(the Company) as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and our report dated November 15, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs is discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for convertible debt as of October 1, 2021, due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entitys Own Equity.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAccounting for Convertible Debt\nAs described in Note 9 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, in December 2022, the Company issued $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.750% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2029 (the 2029 Convertible Notes). The 2029 Convertible Notes contain certain conversion, redemption, and other embedded features that require the Company to assess if such features are embedded derivatives that require bifurcation from the 2029 Convertible Notes, and are to be accounted for separately. The Company determined the embedded features did not require bifurcation from the 2029 Convertible Notes, and therefore were not accounted for separately.\nWe identified the Companys accounting for the 2029 Convertible Notes as a critical audit matter. Determination of the accounting treatment for the 2029 Convertible Notes required complex evaluation in order to: (a) identify the embedded conversion, redemption, and other features present within the 2029 Convertible Notes, and (b) assess if the conditions requiring one or more of the identified embedded features to be bifurcated were satisfied.

At our pawn stores, we advance cash against the value of collateralized personal property. We also sell merchandise, primarily collateral forfeited from pawn activities and pre-owned merchandise purchased from customers. We fulfill short-term cash needs to consumers, with a focus on delivering an industry-leading customer experience.\nAs of September 30, 2023, we operated a total of 1,231 locations, consisting of:\n529 United States pawn stores (operating primarily as EZPAWN or Value Pawn & Jewelry);\n549 Mexico pawn stores (operating primarily as Empe\u00f1o F\u00e1cil and Cash Apoyo Efectivo); and\n153 pawn stores in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras (operating as GuatePrenda and MaxiEfectivo).\nWe have an equity interest (43.7% as of September 30, 2023) in Cash Converters International Limited (Cash Converters), a publicly traded company (ASX:CCV) headquartered in Perth, Western Australia. Cash Converters and its controlled companies comprise a diverse group generating revenues from franchising, store operations, personal finance (including pawn transactions) and vehicle finance, in over 600 stores across 14 countries. Additionally, we own a preferred interest in Founders One, LLC (Founders) that has majority ownership in Simple Management Group, Inc. (SMG).\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and are expressed in U.S. dollars. They include the accounts of EZCORP, Inc., and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. We use the equity method of accounting for entities over which we exercise significant influence, but in which we have a 50% or less investment. We account for equity investments in entities over which we do not exercise significant influence, and do not have a readily determinable fair value, at cost. If we obtain evidence the fair value of such an investment has declined below its cost, we reduce the recorded cost to the lower value through an impairment charge recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates and Assumptions\nThe preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We regularly evaluate estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, inventory, loan loss allowances, long-lived and intangible assets, share-based compensation, income taxes, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience, observable trends and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from the estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nPawn Loans and Revenue Recognition\nOur pawn loans are fully collateralized and the carrying values are based on the initial amounts loaned to customers. We record pawn service charges using the effective interest method over the life of the pawn loans for all pawn loans we believe to be collectible. We base our estimate of collectability on several inputs, including recent redemption rates, historical trends in redemption rates and the amount of loans due in the following months. Unexpected variations in any of these factors could change our estimate of collectability and affect our results of operations and financial condition. If a pawn loan is not repaid, the forfeited collateral is recorded as inventory at the lower of the principal balance of the pawn loan or the net realizable value of the item. As of September 30, 2023, consolidated pawn loans outstanding was $245.8 million, of which $95.5 million (39%) is attributable to stores in Texas and $25.7 million (10%) is attributable to stores in Florida.\nMerchandise Sales Revenue Recognition\nOur performance obligations for merchandise sales primarily relate to point in time retail sales in our stores. We recognize the satisfaction of the performance obligations and record merchandise sales revenue and the related costs when merchandise inventory is sold and delivered to the customer or, in the case of a layaway sale, when we receive the final payment. Customer layaway deposits are recorded as liabilities when a customer provides a deposit for merchandise. Customer layaway deposits are generally refundable upon cancellation. Our customer layaway deposits balance as of September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $18.9 million, $16.0 million and $12.6 million, respectively, and are generally recognized as revenue within a one-year period. Customers have a limited period of time to return merchandise for a refund or exchange, and actual returns for refunds are not material. Sales taxes collected on sales of inventory are excluded from the amounts recognized as merchandise sales and are recorded as Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets until remitted to the appropriate governmental authorities.\nFor precious metals and stones sold as scrap, we recognize the satisfaction of the performance obligations and record the revenues and the related costs when the inventory is legally transferred to the refiner and the refiner obtains control of the inventory. The accounts receivable outstanding at the end of a given reporting period from such transactions are not material as payments are generally received within a short period of time after the legal transfer of the inventory.\nOur transaction prices are explicitly stated within the contracts with our customers.\nInventory and Cost of Goods Sold\nIf a pawn loan is not redeemed, the forfeited collateral is recorded as inventory at the lower of the principal balance of the pawn loan or the net realizable value of the item. We do not record a loan loss allowance or charge-off expense on the principal portion of forfeited pawn loans, as such loans are fully collateralized. Inventory is recorded using the specific identification method of accounting.\nIn order to state inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, we record an allowance for excess, obsolete or slow-moving inventory based on the type and age of the underlying merchandise. Our inventory consists primarily of general merchandise and jewelry. Merchandise cost of goods sold as recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Operations includes the historical cost of inventory sold, inventory shrinkage and any change in the allowance for inventory shrinkage and valuation. We include the costs of operating our central jewelry processing unit as Jewelry scrapping cost of goods sold in our Consolidated Statements of Operations as such costs relate directly to sales of precious metals and stones to refiners.\nWe consider our estimates of obsolete or slow-moving inventory and shrinkage critical to the determination of the appropriate overall valuation allowance for inventory. We continually monitor our sales margins for each type of inventory and compare the current margins to historical margins. Significant variances in those margins may require a revision to future inventory reserve estimates. We determine our reserve pertaining to jewelry inventory based on the current and projected prices of gold. Future declines in the value of gold may result in an increase in reserves pertaining to jewelry inventory.\nSituations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions, changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, decreases in demand for our products or inventory obsolescence resulting from changes in technology.\nWith respect to our Mexico pawn operations, we do not own the forfeited collateral. However, we assume the risk of loss on such collateral and are solely responsible for its care and disposition and, therefore, record such collateral as inventory in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, inventory related to our Mexico pawn operations was $31.4 million and $29.8 million, respectively.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Cash Concentrations\nCash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit or highly liquid investments with original contractual maturities of three months or less, or money market mutual funds. We hold cash at major financial institutions in amounts that often exceed FDIC insured limits. We manage our credit risk associated with cash and cash equivalents and cash concentrations by maintaining our cash deposits in high quality financial institutions and by periodically evaluating the credit quality of the primary financial institutions issuing investments or holding such deposits. Historically, we have not experienced any losses due to such cash concentrations.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash consists of $0.3 million related to the acquisition of PLO del Bajio S. de. R.L. de C.V. as discussed in Note 3: Acquisitions and $8.1 million held in escrow pending the resolution of a pre-closing tax indemnity claim related to the sale of Grupo Finmart.\nInvestments\nWe account for our investment in Cash Converters under the equity method. Because the fiscal year of Cash Converters ends three months before our fiscal year, we record our interest from the results of Cash Converters on a three-month lag. Thus, the results of our operations reported for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 include our percentage interest in the results of Cash Converters for the twelve-month periods ended June 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nDuring the first quarter of our fiscal year, we record our percentage interest in the results of Cash Converters for the three months ended June 30 based on an estimate of the results of Cash Converters for the three months ended March 31 of that year. Similarly, during the third quarter of our fiscal year, we record our percentage interest in the results of Cash Converters for the three months ended December 31 using the estimated results of Cash Converters for the three months ended September 30 of that year. Cash Converters files semi-annual financial reports with the Australian Securities & Investments Commission and the Australian Stock Exchange as of and for the periods ended June 30 and December 31. We use these publicly available financial reports to adjust the estimated amounts we recorded. The actual results of Cash Converters may vary from our estimates. Refer to Note 5: Strategic Investments for further details on our investment in Cash Converters.\nWe account for our investment in Rich Data Corporation (RDC) in accordance with ASC 321, Investments - Equity Securities, and we have elected to use the measurement alternative to measure this investment at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer, if any. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the carrying value of our investment in RDC was $6.2 million.\nRefer to Note 5: Strategic Investments for details on our investment in Founders.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. We have elected not to recognize on the balance sheet leases with terms of one year or less as a practical expedient. Operating lease assets are included in Right-of-use assets, net and financing lease assets are included in Other assets, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We enter into operating lease agreements for real estate related to pawn locations and corporate offices. We have entered into financing lease agreements mainly for motor vehicles.\nOperating and financing lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of fixed lease payments using the Companys incremental borrowing rate. As our leases generally do not include an implicit rate, we compute our incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date applying the portfolio approach to groups of leases with similar characteristics. Our lease terms include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain we will exercise its option. We used incremental borrowing rates that match the duration of the remaining lease terms of our operating leases on a fully collateralized basis to initially measure our lease liability. We evaluate renewal options periodically for any changes in assumptions.\nWe do not account for lease and non-lease components separately. Lease components generally include rent, taxes and insurance, and non-lease components generally include common area maintenance. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment in the same manner as long-lived assets. We recognize lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term with variable lease expense recognized in the period in which the costs are incurred. Our operating lease portfolio consists of pawn locations and corporate offices with lease terms ranging from three to ten years, including options to renew. Our financing lease terms range from two to five years. We generally account for the initial lease term of our pawn locations as up to ten years. Our primary corporate office is leased through March 2029 with annual escalating rent payments and includes two, five-year extension options at the end of the initial lease term.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the net amount of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination measured at fair value. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually on September 30 and upon the occurrence of certain triggering events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate that the fair value of goodwill may be impaired. We consider the assessment of the occurrence of triggering events or substantive changes in circumstances that may indicate the fair value of goodwill may be impaired to be a critical estimate.\nImpairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. A component of an operating segment is required to be identified as a reporting unit if the component is a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews its operating results.\nWhen testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more-likely-than-not the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more-likely-than-not, we are then required to perform a quantitative impairment test; otherwise, no further analysis is required. We also may elect not to perform a qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to a quantitative impairment test. When performing a quantitative impairment test, we apply a one-step quantitative test and record the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting units carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nWhen we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach based on the present value of expected future cash flows, including terminal value, utilizing a market-based weighted average cost of capital (WACC) determined separately for each reporting unit. The determination of fair value involves the use of estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates, operating margins and terminal growth rates discounted by an estimated WACC derived from other publicly traded companies that are similar but not identical to us from an operational and economic standpoint. We use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainties inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts.\nWe test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. If we believe as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is more-likely-than-not the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required.\nProperty and Equipment\nWe record property and equipment at cost. We depreciate these assets on a straight-line basis using estimated useful lives of 30 years for buildings and two-to-seven years for furniture, equipment and software development costs. We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of their estimated useful life (typically 10 years) or the reasonably assured lease term at the inception of the lease.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets\nThe carrying values of long-lived assets, inclusive of right-of-use (ROU) assets, are periodically reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, such as historical operating losses or plans to close stores before the end of their previously estimated useful lives. A potential impairment has occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets. The estimate of cash flows includes management's assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations. We consider the assumptions associated with the determination of projected future cash flows to be a critical estimate. When a potential impairment has occurred, an impairment write-down is recorded if the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.\nSoftware Development Costs and Cloud Computing Arrangements\nWe capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use and amortize the costs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, typically five years. Net capitalized development costs are included in Capital expenditures, net in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nIn evaluating whether our cloud computing arrangements include a software license, we consider whether we have the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and whether it is feasible for us to either run the software on our own hardware or contract with another party unrelated to the vendor to host the software. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, we account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, we account for the arrangement as a service contract. For cloud computing arrangements that meet the definition of a service contract, the Company capitalizes implementation costs incurred during the application development stage and until the software is ready for its intended use within Other assets, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and then amortizes the costs on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. The hosting service fees are not considered an implementation cost and are treated as a prepaid expense and then the Company amortizes the costs on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Costs related to data conversion, training and other maintenance activities are expensed as incurred.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the total acquisition price to the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired under the acquisition method with goodwill representing the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. We expense transaction costs as incurred. We recognize any adjustments to provisional amounts and goodwill that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined, with the effect on current period earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.\nConvertible Debt Securities\nOn October 1, 2021, we early adopted Accounting Standards Update 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815 - 40), (ASU 2020-06) on a modified retrospective basis. Under ASU 2020-06, we no longer separate the convertible senior notes into liability and equity components. We recognized a cumulative effect of initially applying the ASU as an adjustment to the October 1, 2021 opening balance of retained earnings. The conversion option that was previously accounted for in equity under the cash conversion model was recombined into the convertible debt outstanding, and as a result, additional paid in capital and the related unamortized debt discount on the convertible senior notes were reduced. The removal of the remaining debt discounts recorded for this previous separation has the effect of increasing our net debt balance. The prior period consolidated financial statements have not been retrospectively adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.\nPrior to our adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815 - 40), (ASU 2020-06), on October 1, 2021, we accounted for our convertible debt securities at issuance, by separating the securities into debt and equity components pursuant to the prior accounting standards for convertible debt instruments. The carrying value of the liability components were calculated by measuring the fair value of similar liabilities that did not have an associated conversion feature. The excess of the principal amount over the fair value of the liability component were recorded as a discount with a corresponding increase in additional paid-in capital. The debt discounts were accreted to Interest expense over the respective terms of the convertible debt securities using the effective interest method.\nThe conversion premium of the convertible debt securities were accounted for under the treasury method in accordance with our previous accounting policy, which assumed settlement of the conversion premium (equal to the as-converted value over the face principal amount) in shares of our Class A Common Stock.\nForeign Currency\nOur foreign subsidiaries use the local currency of their respective countries as their functional currency. Assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries' balance sheet accounts and our equity method investments are translated from their respective functional currencies into United States dollars at the exchange rate at the end of each quarter, and their earnings are translated into United States dollars at the average exchange rate each quarter. We present resulting translation adjustments as a separate component of stockholders equity. The cumulative translation adjustments associated with the net assets of foreign subsidiaries are the only amounts recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity.\nForeign currency transaction gains and losses not accounted for as translations are included in Other expense (income) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nStore Expenses\nIncluded in Store expenses are costs related to operating our stores and any direct costs of support offices. These costs include labor, other direct expenses such as utilities, supplies and banking fees and indirect expenses such as store rent, building repairs and maintenance, advertising, store property taxes and insurance and regional and area management expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nIncluded in General and administrative expense are costs related to our executive and administrative offices. This includes executive and administrative salaries, wages, stock and incentive compensation, professional fees, license fees, costs related to the operation of our administrative offices such as rent, property taxes, insurance, information technology and other corporate costs.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and included primarily within Store expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. These costs were $4.9 million, $2.3 million and $1.6 million for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we incurred $2.9 million and $0.3 million, respectively, related to digital advertising. The remaining for each year relates to general advertising costs.\nStock Compensation\nWe measure share-based compensation expense at the grant date based on the price of underlying shares at that date and recognize it as expense ratably over the vesting or service period, as applicable, of the stock award. Our policy is to recognize expense on performance-based awards, where satisfaction of the performance condition is probable, ratably over the awards vesting period and recognize expense on awards that only have service requirements on a straight-line basis. We recognize forfeitures as they occur when calculating share-based compensation expense.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their tax basis and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the related temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized when the rate change is enacted.\nWe consider the earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs and our specific plans for reinvestment of those subsidiary earnings. We have not recorded a deferred tax liability related to the U.S. federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes of our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the U.S. We treat taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) as a current-period expense when incurred.\nWe may be subject to income tax audits by the respective tax authorities in any or all of the jurisdictions in which we operate or have operated within a relevant period. Significant judgment is required in determining uncertain tax positions. We utilize the required two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments, and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of an audit or the refinement of an estimate. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. We believe adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all periods. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as Income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our policy is to release income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income on a segregated unit of account basis.\nWe consider our assessment of the recognition of deferred tax assets as well as estimates of uncertain tax positions to be critical estimates.\nEarnings per Share and Common Stock\nWe compute basic earnings per share based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Upon our adoption of ASU 2020-06 on October 1, 2021, interest charges on the convertible debt are required to be added to net income and we calculate diluted earnings per share during the period using the if-converted method. Diluted net income (loss) and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding are adjusted to account for the impact of the assumed issuance of potential common shares that are dilutive, subject to dilution sequencing rules. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding restricted stock awards as well as shares issuable on conversion of our outstanding convertible debt securities. Potential common shares are required to be excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share if the assumed proceeds upon exercise or vest are greater than the cost to re-acquire the same number of shares at the average market price, and therefore the effect would be anti-dilutive. There were no participating securities outstanding during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 requiring the application of the two-class method. When we are in a loss position for the period, dilutive securities are excluded from the calculation of earnings per share, as they would have an anti-dilutive effect.\nPrior to our adoption of ASU 2020-06 on October 1, 2021, diluted earnings per share included the effect of dilutive potential associated with the conversion features embedded in our outstanding convertible debt using the treasury stock method.\nOur capital stock consists of two classes of common stock designated as Class A Non-Voting Common Stock (Class A Common Stock) and Class B Voting Common Stock (Class B Common Stock). The rights, preferences and privileges of the Class A and Class B Common Stock are similar except that each share of Class B Common Stock has one vote and each share of Class A Common Stock has no voting privileges, except as required by law. All Class A Common Stock is publicly held. Holders of Class B Common Stock may, individually or as a class, convert some or all of their shares into Class A Common Stock on a one-to-one basis. Class A Common Stock becomes voting common stock upon the conversion of all Class B Common Stock to Class A Common Stock. We are required to reserve the number of authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common Stock that would be issuable upon conversion of all outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Policies\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815 - 40). ASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on an entitys own equity. The ASU 2020-06 amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years.\nWe adopted this standard as of October 1, 2021 under the modified retrospective basis. Under this transition method, prior period financial information and disclosures were not adjusted and continued to be reported under the accounting standards that were in effect prior to our adoption of ASU 2020-06. The cash conversion model, which the Company has historically used to account for its convertible debt instruments, was eliminated by ASU 2020-06.The adoption of ASU 2020-06 reduced non-cash interest expense for the year ending September 30, 2022 and in future periods due to the derecognition of the debt discount associated with the bifurcated equity component of our convertible notes. The treasury stock method for calculating earnings per share will no longer be allowed for convertible debt instruments whose principal amount may be settled using shares, instead the if-converted method will be required to determine the dilutive effect of our convertible notes.\nImpact of the Adoption of ASU 2020-06\nOn October 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU 2020-06 on a modified retrospective basis. Under ASU 2020-06, we no longer separate the convertible senior notes into liability and equity components. We recognized a cumulative effect of initially applying the ASU as an adjustment to the October 1, 2021 opening balance of retained earnings. The conversion option that was previously accounted for in equity under the cash conversion model was recombined into the convertible debt outstanding, and as a result, additional paid in capital and the related unamortized debt discount on the convertible senior notes were reduced. The removal of the remaining debt discounts recorded for this previous separation has the effect of increasing our net debt balance. The prior period consolidated financial statements have not been retrospectively adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.\nThe impact of adoption on our consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 was primarily to decrease interest expense by $13.9 million. This had the effect of increasing both our basic and diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 by $0.19, and $0.01, respectively. Additionally, adoption of the standard requires interest charges on the convertible debt to be added to net income as well as the use of the if-converted method to calculate diluted earnings per common share.\n(in thousands) As Reported\nSeptember 30, 2021 Adjustments Under ASU 2020-06\nOctober 1, 2021\nPrincipal $ 316,250 $ - $ 316,250\nUnamortized debt discount (48,785) 48,785 -\nDeferred financing costs, net (3,279) (1,500) (4,779)\nNet carrying amount 264,186 47,285 311,471\nDeferred tax asset 9,746 6,607 16,353\nDeferred tax liability 3,684 (4,040) (356)\nAdditional paid-in capital 403,312 (62,804) 340,508\nRetained earnings 326,781 26,166 352,947\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nWe reviewed all recently issued accounting pronouncements and concluded that they were either not applicable or not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNOTE 2: OTHER CHARGES\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we began to implement strategic initiatives to refocus on our core pawn business and optimize our cost structure in order to improve our bottom line performance and position us for sustainable growth. The initiatives focused on workforce reductions, closure of our CASHMAX operations, store closures, write-offs and other miscellaneous charges.\nAccrued charges at September 30, 2023 and 2022 were $2.0 million and $2.2 million, respectively, and are included within Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accrued charges includes $2.0 million related to other costs at September 30, 2023 and 2022 and $0.2 million related to store closure costs at September 30, 2022. There were no charges recorded for fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 and we recorded $0.2 million of charges for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 related to the closure of store operations in Peru.\nNOTE 3: ACQUISITIONS\nFiscal 2021 Acquisitions\nOn June 8, 2021, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the common shares of PLO del Bajio S. de R.L. de C.V. (Bajio) and gained control of the entity, further expanding our geographic footprint within Mexico with the addition of 128 pawn stores. These stores operate under the name Cash Apoyo Efectivo and are located principally in the Mexico City metropolitan area.\nAt the time of acquisition, the total consideration for Bajio was $23.6 million, consisting of $17.4 million of cash, and 212,870 shares of our Class A Non-Voting Common Stock valued at $1.6 million. In addition, the sellers were entitled to additional payments of up to $4.6 million to be paid in two payments over the following two years, contingent on the growth of the loan portfolios of the acquired stores. We had the right, in our discretion, to pay up to 50% of any contingent payment in the form of shares of our Class A Non-Voting Common Stock. The value of the contingent consideration was included in the total consideration as the metrics were considered achievable as of the date of acquisition. Cash paid at closing was $11.6 million, and $3.8 million was paid during the fourth quarter of 2021.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2022, both parties completed the formal working capital reconciliation stipulated within the purchase agreement. As part of the working capital reconciliation, the Company and the seller agreed to reduce the purchase price, which was held in restricted cash as of September 30, 2021, by $1.3 million. As the working capital adjustment was recorded as of September 30, 2021, this reduction to the purchase price is a measurement period adjustment, and resulted in a $1.3 million reduction to goodwill during the period ended December 31, 2021. This reduced the total consideration for Bajio to $22.3 million. As the future payments decreased, we released $1.3 million of the previously held $2.0 million in restricted cash to our unrestricted cash. Of the remaining $0.6 million in restricted cash as of June 30, 2022, $0.3 million was paid during July 2022, and the remaining $0.3 million is expected to be paid on or around the fifth anniversary of the date of acquisition. During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we obtained new information about the seller's calculation of pawn service charges receivable balance as of the date of acquisition, which resulted in a $0.7 million measurement period adjustment to reduce pawn service charges receivable and increase goodwill.\nThe remeasurement of the acquisition-related contingent obligation resulted in a reduction of the obligation to zero as of September 30, 2023, resulting in a $5.1 million reduction of the obligation with an offset recorded to Other (income) expense as an operating item in our consolidated statements of operations during year ended September 30, 2023. There is no remaining obligation in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2022, the estimated fair value of the contingent obligation was $4.6 million and was included in Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of such date. Reductions of acquisition-related contingent obligation after the measurement period adjustment have no impact to goodwill.\nThe assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based upon the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess purchase price over the estimated fair market value of the new assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill.\nThe purchase price allocation is as follows, in thousands:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 308\nPawn loans 4,619\nPawn service charges receivable 691\nInventory 1,319\nProperty and equipment 2,025\nRight-of-use assets 10,651\nGoodwill 25,422\nIntangible assets 3,965\nDeferred tax asset, net 381\nOther assets 746\nAccounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities (2,290)\nDebt (14,931)\nLease liabilities (10,651)\nTotal consideration $ 22,255\nIntangible assets acquired consist of indefinite-lived trade names.\nThe factors contributing to the recognition of goodwill, which is recorded in our Latin America Pawn segment, were based on several strategic and synergistic benefits we expect to realize from the acquisition, including expansion of our store base as well as the ability to further leverage our pawn expertise, investments in information technology and other back office and support functions of our existing Mexico pawn business. We expect none of the goodwill resulting from this business combination will be deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe results of Bajio have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition in our Latin America Pawn segment. The acquired business contributed revenues of $9.6 million and net loss of $0.1 million during the fiscal year 2021, the year of acquisition.\nOn June 9, 2021, we repaid $14.9 million of Bajios existing debt assumed in the acquisition.\nThe following unaudited pro forma summary presents consolidated information for us as if the business combination had occurred on October 1, 2020. The pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of our results of operations had the acquisitions been completed on the above date, nor is it necessarily indicative of our future results. The pro forma information does not reflect any cost savings from operating efficiencies or synergies that could result from the acquisitions, nor does it reflect additional revenue opportunities following the acquisition.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n(in thousands, except per share amounts) 2021\nRevenue $ 748,957\nNet income $ 8,828\nBasic earnings per common share $ 0.16\nDiluted earnings per common share $ 0.16\nWe did not have any material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma gross profit and net income. These pro forma amounts have been calculated after applying the Company's accounting policies and adjusting the results to reflect the additional amortization that would have been incurred assuming the amortization of the trade name had been applied from October 1, 2020.\nDuring the fiscal year end ended September 30, 2021, we incurred total acquisition-related costs of $0.8 million. The acquisition-related costs were primarily related to legal, accounting and consulting services and were expensed as incurred through September 30, 2021, and are included in general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nNOTE 4: EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe following table reconciles the number of common shares used to compute basic and diluted earnings per common share:\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n(in thousands, except per share amounts) 2023 2022 2021\nBasic earnings per common share:\nNet Income - Basic $ 38,463 $ 50,160 $ 8,612\nWeighted shares outstanding - Basic 55,586 56,498 55,744\nBasic earnings per common share $ 0.69 $ 0.89 $ 0.15\nDiluted earnings per common share:\nNet Income - Basic $ 38,463 $ 50,160 $ 8,612\nAdd: Convertible Notes interest expense, net of tax* 4,327 7,489 -\nNet Income - Diluted $ 42,790 $ 57,649 $ 8,612\nWeighted shares outstanding - basic 55,586 56,498 55,744\nEquity-based compensation awards - effect of dilution** 1,482 678 205\nConvertible Notes - effect of dilution 23,797 25,224 -\nWeighted Shares Outstanding - Diluted 80,865 82,400 55,949\nDiluted earnings per common share $ 0.53 $ 0.70 $ 0.15\nPotential common shares excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share above:\nConvertible Notes*** 5,596 - -\nRestricted stock**** 801 1,975 1,233\nTotal 6,397 1,975 1,233\n* The year ended September 30, 2023 includes $5.4 million gain on the partial extinguishment of debt, associated with the 2025 Convertible Notes, which was recorded to Interest expense in the Companys consolidated statement of operations. See Note 9: Debt for additional information.\n** Includes time-based share-based awards and performance based awards for which targets for fiscal year tranches have been achieved and vesting is subject only to achievement of service conditions.\n*** See Note 9: Debt for conversion price and initial conversion rate of the 2024 Convertible Notes, 2025 Convertible Notes and 2029 Convertible Notes. The 2024 Convertible Notes are considered anti-dilutive in the sequencing calculation for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.\n**** Includes antidilutive share-based awards as well as performance-based share-based awards that are contingently issuable, but for which the condition for issuance has not been met as of the end of the reporting period.\nNOTE 5: STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS\nCash Converters International Limited\nThe following table presents the Companys ownership in Cash Converters International Limited (Cash Converters) for the periods presented:\nDate of purchase Purchase amount\n(in thousands)\nShares purchased Shares owned Ownership percentage\nOctober 1, 2021 $ 2,500 13,000,000 236,702,991 37.7 %\nMarch 10, 2022 $ 1,000 5,500,000 242,239,157 38.6 %\nApril 5, 2022 $ 2,500 13,000,000 255,239,157 40.7 %\nSeptember 15, 2022 $ 900 5,700,000 260,939,157 41.6 %\nNovember 2, 2022 $ 2,100 13,000,000 273,939,157 43.7 %\nIn October 2021, April 2022, November 2022 and April 2023, we received cash dividends of $1.7 million, $1.7 million, $1.8 million and $1.8 million, respectively, from Cash Converters.\nAs of September 30, 2023, we owned 273,939,157 shares, or approximately 43.7%, of Cash Converters. We acquired our original investment (representing approximately 30% of the outstanding shares) in November 2009 and have increased our ownership through the acquisition of additional shares periodically since that time.\nThe following tables present summary financial information for Cash Converterss most recently reported results as applicable after translation to U.S. dollars:\nJune 30,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nCurrent assets $ 189,563 $ 158,987\nNon-current assets 103,595 170,798\nTotal assets $ 293,158 $ 329,785\nCurrent liabilities $ 97,630 $ 59,256\nNon-current liabilities 58,777 53,045\nShareholders equity 136,751 217,484\nTotal liabilities and shareholders equity $ 293,158 $ 329,785\nFiscal Year Ended June 30,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nGross revenues $ 203,608 $ 178,215 $ 150,165\nGross profit $ 125,709 $ 116,106 $ 105,851\nNet (loss) profit $ (65,351) $ 8,099 $ 12,081\nOur equity in Cash Converterss net loss was $28.5 million in fiscal 2023. This includes $32.4 million of our share of their non-cash goodwill impairment charge. Our equity in Cash Converterss net income was $2.9 million and $4.3 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. Cash Converterss accumulated undistributed after-tax loss included in our consolidated retained earnings were $16.2 million as of September 30, 2023.\nAt September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of our investment in Cash Converters, as estimated by reference to its quoted market price per share, was greater than its carrying value.\nFounders One, LLC\nIn October 2021, we invested $15.0 million in exchange for a non-redeemable voting participating preferred equity interest in Founders, a newly-formed entity with one other member. Founders used that $15.0 million to acquire an equity interest in SMG.\nOn December 2, 2022, we contributed an additional $15.0 million to Founders associated with our preferred interest, which proceeds were used by Founders to acquire additional common stock in SMG. In addition, we loaned $15.0 million to Founders in exchange for a Demand Promissory Note secured by the common interest in Founders held by the other member. Founders then loaned that $15.0 million to SMG in exchange for a Subordinated Promissory Note.\nWe have an interest in Founders, a variable interest entity, but because the Company is not the primary beneficiary, we do not consolidate Founders. Further, as we are not the appointed manager, we do not have the ability to direct the activities of the investment entity that most significantly impact its economic performance. Consequently, our equity investment in Founders is accounted for utilizing the measurement alternative within Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 321, Investments - Equity Securities. As of September 30, 2023, our $30.0 million carrying value of the investment and $15.0 million Demand Promissory Note are included in Other investments and Prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, our maximum exposure for losses related to our investment in Founders was our $30.0 million equity investment and $15.0 million Demand Promissory Note plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nIn October 2023, we contributed an additional $15.0 million to Founders associated with our preferred interest, for a total equity investment of $45.0 million. See Note 16: Subsequent Events.\nNOTE 6: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that could be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. Categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy is defined into the following three categories:\nLevel 1 - Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Other observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value\nThe tables below present our financial assets and liabilities that were not measured at fair value:\nCarrying Value Estimated Fair Value\nSeptember 30, 2023 September 30, 2023 Fair Value Measurement Using\n(in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nFinancial assets:\n2.89% promissory note receivable due April 2024\n$ 1,251 $ 1,251 $ - $ - $ 1,251\n12.00% promissory note receivable from Founders\n16,500 16,500 - - 16,500\nInvestments in unconsolidated affiliate 10,987 35,998 35,998 - -\nFinancial liabilities:\n2024 Convertible Notes $ 34,265 $ 35,765 $ - $ 35,765 $ -\n2025 Convertible Notes 102,563 96,137 - 96,137 -\n2029 Convertible Notes 223,284 224,112 - 224,112 -\nCarrying Value Estimated Fair Value\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2022 Fair Value Measurement Using\n(in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nFinancial assets:\n2.89% promissory note receivable due April 2024\n$ 1,215 $ 1,215 $ - $ - $ 1,215\nInvestments in unconsolidated affiliate 37,733 40,279 40,279 - -\nFinancial liabilities:\n2024 Convertible Notes $ 142,575 $ 157,727 $ - $ 157,727 $ -\n2025 Convertible Notes 170,328 147,488 - 147,488 -\nBased primarily on the short-term nature of cash and cash equivalents, pawn loans, pawn service charges receivable and other liabilities, we estimate that their carrying value approximates fair value. We consider our cash and cash equivalents to be measured using Level 1 inputs and our pawn loans, pawn service charges receivable and other liabilities to be measured using Level 3 inputs. Significant increases or decreases in the underlying assumptions used to value pawn loans, pawn service charges receivable, consumer loans, fees and interest receivable and other debt could significantly increase or decrease these fair value estimates.\nThe inputs used to generate the fair value of the investment in Cash Converters were considered Level 1 inputs. These inputs consist of (a) the quoted stock price on the Australian Stock Exchange multiplied by (b) the number of shares we owned multiplied by (c) the applicable foreign currency exchange rate as of the end of our reporting period. We included no control premium for owning a large percentage of outstanding shares.\nWe measured the fair value of the 2024, 2025 and 2029 Convertible Notes using quoted price inputs. The notes are not actively traded, and thus the price inputs represent a Level 2 measurement. As the quoted price inputs are highly variable from day to day, the fair value estimates disclosed above could significantly increase or decrease.\nIn March 2019, we received $1.1 million in previously escrowed seller funds as a result of settling certain indemnification claims with the seller of GPMX. In April 2019, we loaned the $1.1 million back to the seller of GPMX in exchange for a promissory note. The note bears interest at the rate of 2.89% per annum and is secured by certain marketable securities owned by the seller and held in a U.S. brokerage account. All principal and accrued interest is due and payable in April 2024. Based primarily on the short-term nature of the note, we estimate that its carrying value approximates fair value as of September 30, 2023.\nIn December 2022, we loaned $15.0 million to Founders in exchange for a Demand Promissory Note secured by the common interest in Founders held by the other member. As of September 30, 2023, the interest rate on the note was 12.00% per annum, and all principal and accrued interest is due on demand. Based primarily on the short-term nature of the note, we estimate that its carrying value approximates fair value as of September 30, 2023. In October 2023, the interest rate on the demand promissory note from Founders was increased to 15.00% per annum. See Note 16: Subsequent Events.\nThe Company remeasures its acquisition-related contingent obligation associated with the acquisition of Bajio at the end of each reporting period. This remeasurement resulted in a $5.1 million reduction of the obligation with an offset recorded to Other as an operating item in our consolidated statements of operations during year ended September 30, 2023. There is no remaining obligation in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2022, the estimated fair value of the contingent obligation was $4.6 million and was included in Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The key assumptions used to determine the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration are estimated by management, not observable in the market and, therefore considered Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy.\nSee Note 12: Leases for discussion on the non-recurring fair value adjustment related to our corporate office lease during fiscal year 2023.\nNOTE 7: PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nMajor classifications of property and equipment were as follows:\nSeptember 30,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands) Carrying\nAmount Accumulated\nDepreciation Net Book\nValue Carrying\nAmount Accumulated\nDepreciation Net Book\nValue\nLand $ 4 $ - $ 4 $ 4 $ - $ 4\nBuildings and improvements 146,687 (109,710) 36,977 123,434 (95,666) 27,768\nFurniture and equipment 164,818 (133,870) 30,948 148,675 (120,747) 27,928\nSoftware 33,952 (33,785) 167 33,803 (33,529) 274\nConstruction in progress - - - 751 - 751\n$ 345,461 $ (277,365) $ 68,096 $ 306,667 $ (249,942) $ 56,725\nThe depreciation of property and equipment is recorded as depreciation expense and included under Depreciation and amortization recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. These amounts were $22.1 million, $20.4 million and $19.4 million for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNOTE 8: GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually on September 30 and upon the occurrence of certain triggering events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate that the fair value of goodwill may be impaired.\nAs of September 30, 2023, we assessed qualitative and quantitative factors and determined that it was not more-likely-than-not that the fair values of our reporting units were less than their carrying values as of the testing date. As a result of our assessment, no goodwill impairment charge was recorded during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. There was no impairment charge during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Accumulated goodwill impairment losses of $41.3 million were recorded prior to 2021 associated with the U.S. Pawn ($10.0 million) and Latin America Pawn ($31.3 million) segments because of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on typical customer behavior, which led to a significant decline in pawn loan balances and the mandated closure of stores in our GPMX countries.\nThe following table presents the changes in the carrying value of goodwill by segment:\n(in thousands) U.S. Pawn Latin America Pawn Consolidated\nBalances as of September 30, 2021 $ 244,471 $ 41,287 $ 285,758\nAcquisitions 1,032 - 1,032\nMeasurement period adjustments - (678) (678)\nEffect of foreign currency translation changes - 716 716\nBalances as of September 30, 2022 $ 245,503 $ 41,325 $ 286,828\nAcquisitions 10,439 - 10,439\nEffect of foreign currency translation changes - 5,105 5,105\nBalances as of September 30, 2023 $ 255,942 $ 46,430 $ 302,372\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we acquired nine pawn stores located in Houston, Texas and one luxury pawn store in Las Vegas, Nevada for total cash consideration of $13.0 million, inclusive of all ancillary arrangements, of which $9.5 million was recorded as goodwill. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we acquired one pawn store located in Nashville, Tennessee and one store in San Antonio, Texas for total cash consideration of $1.9 million, inclusive of all ancillary arrangements, of which $0.9 million was recorded as goodwill. These acquisitions expand our position in these strategic markets, and the luxury pawn transaction expands our offerings by providing a dedicated and targeted focus on higher-end products. These acquisitions were immaterial, individually and in the aggregate, and we have therefore omitted or aggregated certain disclosures.\nAs of September 30, 2023, we assessed qualitative and quantitative factors and determined that it was not more-likely-than-not that the fair values of our indefinite-lived intangible assets were less than their carrying values. Based on our assessment as of September 30, 2023, no impairment charges were recorded related to intangible assets or long-lived asset groups.\nThe following table presents the balance of each major class of intangible assets:\nSeptember 30,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nNon-amortizing intangible assets:\nTrade names $ 19,793 $ 18,591\nPawn licenses 9,535 9,535\n$ 29,328 $ 28,126\nAmortizing intangible assets:\nInternally developed software $ 89,488 $ 79,146\nAccumulated amortization (60,628) (50,600)\n$ 28,860 $ 28,546\nOther $ 2,346 $ 2,344\nAccumulated amortization (2,318) (2,197)\n$ 28 $ 147\nIntangible assets, net $ 58,216 $ 56,819\nThe amortization of most definite-lived intangible assets is recorded as amortization expense and included under Depreciation and amortization expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The 2029 Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated December 12, 2022 (the 2022 Indenture) by and between the Company and Truist Bank, as trustee. The 2029 Convertible Notes were issued in a private offering under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. The 2029 Convertible Notes pay interest semi-annually in arrears at a rate of 3.750% per annum on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing June 15, 2023, and mature on December 15, 2029 (the 2029 Maturity Date), unless converted, redeemed or repurchased in accordance with the terms prior to such date. At maturity, the holders of the 2029 Convertible Notes will be entitled to receive cash equal to the principal of the 2029 Convertible Notes plus accrued interest.\nThe effective interest rate for fiscal 2023 was approximately 4.28%. As of September 30, 2023, the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs will be amortized using the effective interest method through the 2029 Maturity Date assuming no early conversion.\nThe 2029 Convertible Notes are convertible based on an initial conversion rate of 89.0313 shares of Class A Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount (equivalent to an initial conversion price of $11.23 per share). The conversion rate will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. The 2029 Convertible Notes contain certain make-whole fundamental change premiums and customary anti-dilution adjustments. Upon conversion, we may settle in cash, shares of Class A Common Stock or any combination thereof, at our election.\nPrior to June 15, 2029, the 2029 Convertible Notes will be convertible only under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending on March 31, 2023 (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of our Class A Common Stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the measurement period) in which the trading price, as defined in the 2022 Indenture, per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our Class A Common Stock and the conversion rate on such trading day; (3) if we call any or all of the 2029 Convertible Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events, as defined in the 2022 Indenture. On or after June 15, 2029 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the 2029 Maturity Date, holders of 2029 Convertible Notes may, at their option, convert their 2029 Convertible Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances.\nWe may not redeem the Notes prior to December 21, 2026. At our option, we may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2029 Convertible Notes on or after December 21, 2026, if the last reported sale price of the Class A Common Stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption, during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption. The redemption price will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2029 Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the 2029 Convertible Notes were not convertible as no conditions of conversion had been met. Accordingly, the net balance of the 2029 Convertible Notes was classified as a non-current liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2023. The classification of the 2029 Convertible Notes as current or non-current in the Consolidated Balance Sheets is evaluated at each balance sheet date and may change from time to time depending on whether any of the conversion conditions has been met.\nIf one of the conversion conditions is met in any future fiscal quarter, we will classify our net liability under the 2029 Convertible Notes as a current liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the end of that fiscal quarter. If none of the conversion conditions have been met in a future fiscal quarter prior to the one-year period immediately preceding the 2029 Maturity Date, we will classify our net liability under the 2029 Convertible Notes as a non-current liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the end of that fiscal quarter. If the note holders elect to convert their 2029 Convertible Notes prior to maturity, any unamortized debt issuance costs will be recognized as expense at the time of conversion. If the entire outstanding principal amount had been converted on September 30, 2023, we would have recorded an expense associated with the conversion, comprised of $6.7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs. As of September 30, 2023, none of the note holders had elected to convert their 2029 Convertible Notes.\nThe stock trading price condition and other triggers are measured on a quarter-by-quarter basis and were not met as of September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2023, the if-converted value of the 2029 Convertible Notes did not exceed the principal amount.\nNote Repurchases\nIn December 2022, we repurchased approximately $109.4 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2024 for approximately $117.5 million plus accrued interest and approximately $69.1 million aggregate principal amount of 2.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2025 for approximately $62.9 million plus accrued interest and recognized a $3.5 million loss on extinguishment of debt recorded to Interest expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n2.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2025\nIn May 2018, we issued $172.5 million aggregate principal amount of 2.375% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2025 (the 2025 Convertible Notes), for which $103.4 million remains outstanding as of September 30, 2023. The 2025 Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated May 14, 2018 (the 2018 Indenture) by and between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the original trustee. Effective October 1, 2019, Truist (formerly BB&T) assumed the duties and responsibilities as trustee under the 2018 Indenture. The 2025 Convertible Notes were issued in a private offering under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. The 2025 Convertible Notes pay interest semi-annually in arrears at a rate of 2.375% per annum on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing November 1, 2018, and mature on May 1, 2025 (the 2025 Maturity Date), unless converted, redeemed or repurchased in accordance with the terms prior to such date.\nThe effective interest rate for fiscal 2023 was approximately 2.88% for the 2025 Convertible Notes. As of September 30, 2023, the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs will be amortized using the effective interest method through the 2025 Maturity Date assuming no early conversion.\nThe 2025 Convertible Notes are convertible based on an initial conversion rate of 62.8931 shares of Class A Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount (equivalent to an initial conversion price of $15.90 per share). The conversion rate will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. The 2025 Convertible Notes contain certain make-whole fundamental change premiums and customary anti-dilution adjustments. Upon conversion, we may settle in cash, shares of Class A Common Stock or any combination thereof, at our election.\nPrior to November 1, 2024, the 2025 Convertible Notes are convertible only under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ended on June 30, 2018 (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of our Class A Common Stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the measurement period) in which the trading price, as defined in the 2018 Indenture, per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our Class A Common Stock and the conversion rate on such trading day; (3) if we call any or all of the 2025 Convertible Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events, as defined in the 2018 Indenture. On or after November 1, 2024 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the 2025 Maturity Date, holders of 2025 Convertible Notes may, at their option, convert their 2025 Convertible Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances.\nAt our option, we may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2025 Convertible Notes on or after May 1, 2022, if the last reported sale price of the Class A Common Stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption, during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption. The redemption price will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the 2025 Convertible Notes were not convertible as no conditions of conversion had been met. Accordingly, the net balance of the 2025 Convertible Notes was classified as a non-current liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2023. The classification of the 2025 Convertible Notes as current or non-current in the Consolidated Balance Sheets is evaluated at each balance sheet date and may change from time to time depending on whether any of the conversion conditions has been met.\nIf one of the conversion conditions is met in any future fiscal quarter, we will classify our net liability under the 2025 Convertible Notes as a current liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the end of that fiscal quarter. If none of the conversion conditions have been met in a future fiscal quarter prior to the one-year period immediately preceding the 2025 Maturity Date, we will classify our net liability under the 2025 Convertible Notes as a non-current liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the end of that fiscal quarter. If the note holders elect to convert their 2025 Convertible Notes prior to maturity, any unamortized debt issuance costs will be recognized as expense at the time of conversion. If the entire outstanding principal amount had been converted on September 30, 2023, we would have recorded an expense associated with the conversion, comprised of $0.8 million of unamortized debt issuance costs. As of September 30, 2023, none of the note holders had elected to convert their 2025 Convertible Notes.\nThe stock trading price condition and other triggers are measured on a quarter-by-quarter basis and were not met as of September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2023, the if-converted value of the 2025 Convertible Notes did not exceed the principal amount.\n2.875% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2024\nIn July 2017, we issued $143.75 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2024 (the 2024 Convertible Notes), for which $34.4 million remains outstanding as of September 30, 2023. The 2024 Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated July 5, 2017 (the 2017 Indenture) by and between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the original trustee. Effective October 1, 2019, Truist (formerly BB&T) assumed the duties and responsibilities as trustee under the 2017 Indenture. The 2024 Convertible Notes were issued in a private offering under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. The 2024 Convertible Notes pay interest semi-annually in arrears at a rate of 2.875% per annum on January 1 and July 1 of each year, commencing January 1, 2018, and mature on July 1, 2024 (the 2024 Maturity Date), unless converted, redeemed or repurchased in accordance with the terms prior to such date. At maturity, the holders of the 2024 Convertible Notes will be entitled to receive cash equal to the principal of the 2024 Convertible Notes plus accrued interest.\nThe effective interest rate for fiscal 2023 was approximately 3.35%. As of September 30, 2023, the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs will be amortized using the effective interest method through the 2024 Maturity Date assuming no early conversion.\nThe 2024 Convertible Notes are convertible based on an initial conversion rate of 100 shares of Class A Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount (equivalent to an initial conversion price of $10.00 per share). The conversion rate will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. The 2024 Convertible Notes contain certain make-whole fundamental change premiums and customary anti-dilution adjustments. Upon conversion, we may settle in cash, shares of Class A Common Stock or any combination thereof, at our election.\nPrior to January 1, 2024, the 2024 Convertible Notes will be convertible only under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending on September 30, 2017 (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of our Class A Common Stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the measurement period) in which the trading price, as defined in the 2017 Indenture, per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our Class A Common Stock and the conversion rate on such trading day; (3) if we call any or all of the 2024 Convertible Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events, as defined in the 2017 Indenture. On or after January 1, 2024 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the 2024 Maturity Date, holders of 2024 Convertible Notes may, at their option, convert their 2024 Convertible Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances.\nAt our option, we may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2024 Convertible Notes on or after July 6, 2021, if the last reported sale price of the Class A Common Stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption, during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption. The redemption price will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2024 Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the 2024 Convertible Notes were not convertible as no conditions of conversion had been met. The 2024 Convertible Notes mature on July 1, 2024, accordingly, the balance was classified as a current liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2023.\nIf the note holders elect to convert their 2024 Convertible Notes prior to maturity, any unamortized debt issuance costs will be recognized as expense at the time of conversion. If the entire outstanding principal amount had been converted on September 30, 2023, we would have recorded an expense associated with the conversion, comprised of $0.1 million of unamortized debt issuance costs. As of September 30, 2023, none of the note holders had elected to convert their 2024 Convertible Notes.\nThe stock trading price condition and other triggers are measured on a quarter-by-quarter basis and were not met as of September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2023, the if-converted value of the 2024 Convertible Notes did not exceed the principal amount.\nNOTE 10: COMMON STOCK AND STOCK COMPENSATION\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program\nOn May 3, 2022, our Board of Directors (the Board) authorized the repurchase of up to $50 million of our Class A Common Stock over three years (the Common Stock Repurchase Program). Execution of the program will be responsive to fluctuating market conditions and valuations, liquidity needs and the expected return on investment compared to other opportunities.\nThe amount and timing of purchases will be dependent on a variety of factors, including stock price, trading volume, general market conditions, legal and regulatory requirements, general business conditions, the level of cash flows, and corporate considerations determined by management and the Board, such as liquidity and capital needs and the availability of attractive alternative investment opportunities. The Board has reserved the right to modify, suspend or terminate the program at any time. As of September 30, 2023, we had repurchased and retired 1,627,045 shares of our Class A Common Stock for $14.0 million under the Common Stock Repurchase Program, of which 1,389,102 shares were repurchased and retired for $12.0 million during fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. The repurchase amount is allocated between Additional paid-in capital and Retained earnings in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOther Common Stock Repurchases\nDuring December 2022, we used approximately $5.0 million of the net proceeds from the 2029 Convertible Notes offering to repurchase for cash 578,703 shares of our Class A Common Stock from purchasers of the notes in privately negotiated transactions. Such transactions were authorized separately from, and not considered a part of, the publicly announced Common Stock Repurchase Program discussed above. The repurchase amount is allocated between Additional paid-in capital and Retained earnings in our consolidated balance sheets.\nStock Compensation\nWe utilize equity-based awards as a long-term incentive to attract and retain qualified employees, consultants and directors and motivate them to achieve long-term goals, thereby promoting the long-term financial interests of the Company and enhancing long-term stockholder return.\n2022 LTI Plan\nOn March 1, 2022, we adopted the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2022 LTI Plan), which gives us the ability to grant equity-based incentive compensation awards, in the form of restricted stock or restricted stock units, to its employees, members of the Board of Directors and consultants, independent contractors or advisors who are determined to have a direct and significant effect on the Companys performance. The total number of shares of Class A Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to awards under the 2022 LTI Plan (Authorized Shares) is such number that is from time to time approved by the holder of the Companys Class B Voting Common Stock (the Voting Stockholder). At the time the 2022 LTI Plan was adopted, 400,000 shares of our Class A Common Stock were added as Authorized Shares. That number was increased to 1,900,000 in October 2022 and to 3,300,000 in November 2023. At any time, the number of shares that are available for issuance under future awards (Available Shares) is equal to the number of Authorized Shares reduced by the number of shares previously issued and the number of shares that may be issued under outstanding awards. The number of Available Shares is increased for shares covered by awards that are forfeited, cancelled or otherwise terminated without the issuance of shares or shares that are withheld at the request of a participant to satisfy such participants tax withholding obligations.\nThe 2022 LTI Plan is administered by the People and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the Committee). The Committee generally determines and recommends the type, recipient, amount and terms for all awards issued under the 2022 LTI Plan, but each award issuance requires the approval of the full Board of Directors.\nRestricted stock awards are generally subject to continued service over a specified period (typically one-to-three years) and expensed straight-line over the service period. Restricted stock units are generally subject to the achievement of performance goals in addition to continued service, and they are expensed, on a tranche-by-tranche basis, ratably over the service period beginning with the start of the measurement of performance.\n2010 LTI Plan\nThe 2022 LTI Plan replaced the 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2010 LTI Plan) for all long-term incentive awards issued from and after January 1, 2022. The 2010 LTI Plan remains effective, but only with respect to LTI awards issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2021, and any authorized but unissued shares remaining in the 2010 LTI Plan are available only to satisfy such awards.\nUnder the 2010 LTI Plan, we granted awards of restricted stock or restricted stock units to employees and non-employee directors. Awards granted to employees were typically subject to performance and service conditions. Awards granted to non-employee directors were time-based awards subject only to service conditions. Awards were measured at the grant date fair value with compensation costs associated with the awards recognized over the requisite service period, usually the vesting period, on a straight-line basis.\nBoard of Director Awards\nImmediately after our 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders in March 2023, we granted each of the five non-employee directors a restricted stock award covering 18,038 shares (90,190 shares in total). Those shares are scheduled to vest on the day immediately preceding the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (but in no event later than March 31, 2024), subject only to service conditions.\nIn March 2022, we granted each of the five non-employee directors a restricted stock award covering 26,490 shares (132,450 shares in total). Those shares vested on the day immediately preceding the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders in March 2023.\nIn February 2021, we granted each of the four non-employee directors serving at that time a restricted stock award covering 31,936 shares (127,744 shares in total). Those shares vested on the day immediately preceding our 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders in March 2022.\nIn December 2020, we granted each of the nine non-employee directors serving at that time a restricted stock award covering 15,905 shares (143,145 shares in total). Those shares were scheduled to vest on March 31, 2021, subject only to service conditions. The vesting of 79,525 of such shares was accelerated to February 18, 2021 (the date of the 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders) when the term of service for five of the non-employee directors ended. The remaining 63,620 shares vested on March 31, 2021.\nEmployee Awards\nFY23 Awards - In October 2022, we granted restricted stock unit awards covering a total of 912,524 shares to our executive officers and other key employees. These awards were issued as part of our annual LTI program for fiscal 2023. The awards have a three-year performance period consisting of fiscal 2023, fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025. For each award, 60% of the total number of shares was allocated equally among the three fiscal years in the performance period (20% each), with each tranche having separate performance conditions. In addition, 20% of the total number of shares was allocated to a three-year cumulative performance condition applicable to the entire three-year performance period, and 20% was subject only to continued service. The number of shares available to vest from each performance-based tranche can range from 0 to 150% and is dependent on the achievement of the performance conditions for that tranche. All of the performance-based shares that become available to vest based on the achievement of the performance conditions, along with the time-based tranche, will vest on September 30, 2025, so long as the recipient continues active employment with the Company through that date. Performance targets for the fiscal 2023 tranche and the three-year cumulative tranche were determined and communicated at the time of grant. Grant dates for the fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025 tranches will be determined when the applicable performance targets are established for those tranches. As of September 30, 2023, we considered the performance targets for the fiscal 2023 tranche to be probable of achievement at the 147.3% level and the cumulative performance target for the three-year cumulative tranche to be probable of achievement at the 100% level. During fiscal 2023, we granted restricted stock unit awards covering an additional 8,036 shares to key employees in connection with promotions or new hires. These additional awards carry the same terms as those granted in October 2022.\nFY22 Awards - In October and November 2021, we granted restricted stock unit awards covering a total of 981,327 shares to our executive officers and other key employees. These awards were issued as part of our annual LTI program for fiscal 2022. The awards have a three-year performance period consisting of fiscal 2022, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024. For each award, the total number of shares was allocated equally among the three fiscal years in the performance period, with each tranche having separate performance conditions. The number of shares available to vest from each tranche can range from 0 to 150% and is dependent on the achievement of the performance condition for that tranche. All of the shares that become available to vest based on the achievement of the performance conditions will vest on September 30, 2024, so long as the recipient continues active employment with the Company through that date. Performance targets for the fiscal 2022 tranche were determined and communicated at the time of grant. Grant dates for the other two tranches will be determined when the applicable performance targets are established for these tranches. As of September 30, 2022, we considered the performance targets for the fiscal 2022 tranche to be probable of achievement at the 150% level, and as of September 30, 2023, we considered the performance targets for the fiscal 2023 tranche to be probable of achievement at the 147.3% level. During fiscal 2022, we granted restricted stock unit awards covering an additional 161,265 shares to executive officers and other key employees in connection with promotions or new hires. These additional awards carry the same terms as those granted in October and November 2021.\nIn October 2021, we granted a restricted stock award covering 29,722 to an executive officer as a special performance and retention award. This awards vests ratably over three years (fiscal 2022, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024), subject only to continued service.\nFY21 Awards - In February 2021, we granted restricted stock units covering a total of 1,177,214 shares to our executive officers and other key employees. The awards have a three-year performance period consisting of fiscal 2021, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023. For each award, the total number of shares was allocated equally among the three fiscal years in the performance period, with each tranche having separate performance conditions. The number of shares available to vest from each tranche can range from 0 to 150% and is dependent on the achievement of the performance condition for that tranche. All of the shares that become available to vest based on the achievement of the performance conditions will vest on September 30, 2023, so long as the recipient continues active employment with the Company through that date. Performance targets for the fiscal 2021 tranche were determined and communicated in February 2021, and performance targets for the fiscal 2022 tranche were determined and communicated in October 2021. The grant date for the fiscal 2023 tranche will be determined when the applicable performance targets are established for that tranche. As of September 30, 2021, we considered the performance targets for the fiscal 2021 tranche to be probable of achievement at the 150% level, as of September 30, 2022, we considered the performance targets for the fiscal 2022 tranche to be probable of achievement at the 150% level, and as of September 30, 2023, we considered the performance targets for the fiscal 2023 tranche to be probable of achievement at the 135.4% level. During fiscal 2021, we granted restricted stock unit awards covering an additional 4,722 shares of restricted stock to employees in connection with promotions or new hires. These additional awards carry the same terms as those granted in February 2021.\nFY20 Awards - In January 2020, the Committee approved restricted stock unit awards for executive officers and key employees, but did not finalize the performance targets at that time. In January 2021, the Committee approved the applicable performance targets and we granted restricted stock unit awards covering a total of 550,224 shares of restricted stock to employees. We consider the awards to have a three-year performance period consisting of fiscal 2020, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, with a service condition applicable to fiscal 2020 and then separate performance conditions applicable to fiscal 2021 and 2022. For each award, the total number of shares was allocated equally among fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, with each tranche having separate performance conditions. The number of shares available to vest from each tranche is dependent on the achievement of the performance condition for that tranche and can range from 0 to 100%. All of the shares that become available to vest based on the achievement of the performance conditions will vest on September 30, 2022, so long as the recipient continues active employment with the Company through that date. Performance targets for the fiscal 2021 tranche were communicated in January 2021, and performance targets for the fiscal 2022 tranche were determined and communicated in October 2021. As of September 30, 2021, we considered the performance targets for the fiscal 2021 tranche to be probable of achievement at the 100% level, and as of September 30, 2022, we considered the performance targets for the fiscal 2022 tranche to be probably of achievement at the 100% level. All of these awards vested in November 2022, after the Committee determined that the performance condition had been met.\nFY19 Awards - In December 2018, we granted restricted stock unit awards covering a total of 971,615 shares to executive officers and other key employees. The awards had a three-year performance period consisting of fiscal 2019, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021, and were subject to a single three-year performance condition as well as a service condition through the end of the performance period. In November 2020, the Committee determined that the stated performance target for such awards was not probable of achievement and approved a modification of such awards that reduced the number of shares available for vesting and established a new one-year performance condition (in addition to the continuing service condition) applicable to the vesting of the remaining shares. We treated this modification as a cancellation of the existing awards and the grant of new awards subject to a new performance condition, which resulted in (1) the cancellation of awards covering 458,960 shares and the reversal of $2.9 million of previously recognized stock compensation expense and (2) the grant of 358,883 shares of restricted stock. During fiscal 2021, we granted restricted stock unit awards covering an additional 61,138 shares of restricted stock to employees in connection with promotions or new hires. These additional awards carried the same terms as those granted in December 2018. All of these awards vested in November 2021, after the Committee determined that the performance condition had been met.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the unamortized fair value of share awards to be amortized over their remaining vesting periods was approximately $10.6 million. The weighted-average period over which these costs will be amortized is approximately two years.\nThe following table presents amounts related to our stock compensation arrangements:\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nShare-based compensation costs $ 9,539 $ 5,053 $ 3,946\nIncome tax (benefit) expense on share-based compensation (1,125) (557) 561\nThe following table presents a summary of stock compensation activity:\nShares Weighted\nAverage\nGrant Date\nFair Value\nOutstanding as of September 30, 2022 2,113,323 $ 5.88\nGranted 1,010,750 7.82\nReleased (a)\n(490,145) 4.94\nCancelled (78,029) 6.70\nOutstanding as of September 30, 2023 2,555,899 $ 6.80\n(a) 118,011 shares were withheld to satisfy related income tax withholding.\nThe following table presents a summary of the fair value of shares granted:\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n(in millions except per share amounts) 2023 2022 2021\nWeighted average grant date fair value per share granted (a)\n$ 7.82 $ 7.24 $ 4.92\nTotal market value of shares released $ 4.7 $ 3.7 $ 3.4\n(a) Awards with performance and time-based vesting provisions are generally valued based upon the underlying share price as of the issuance date.\nOther\nWe have not declared or paid any dividends and currently do not anticipate paying any dividends in the immediate future. As described in Note 9: Debt, payment of a dividend requires an adjustment to the conversion rate of our Convertible Notes. Should we pay dividends in the future, our certificate of incorporation provides that cash dividends on common stock, when declared, must be declared and paid at the same per share amounts on both classes of stock. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors.\nNOTE 11: INCOME TAXES\nThe following table presents the components of our income before income taxes, including inter-segment amounts:\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nDomestic* $ 26,209 $ 49,937 $ 2,320\nForeign 25,424 17,776 13,742\n$ 51,633 $ 67,713 $ 16,062\n* Includes the majority of our corporate administrative costs.

We also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $52.7 million, which will begin to expire in 2030 if not utilized. Additionally, we have a $1.7 million foreign tax credit that will expire between 2024 to 2027 if not utilized.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated tax impact of temporary differences between the tax basis and book basis of assets and liabilities. The Company has elected to account for the tax on GILTI as a period cost and therefore has not recorded deferred taxes related to GILTI on its foreign subsidiaries. A valuation allowance is established against a deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Our valuation allowance has been established to offset certain state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards that are not more likely than not to be utilized prior to expiration. The valuation allowance decreased by $1.1 million in fiscal 2023, primarily due to the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain state NOLs for which a valuation allowance had been recorded as well as a reduction of fully reserved net operating loss carryforward and other deferred tax assets in Canada. We believe our results from future operations will generate sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions such that it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized.\nDeferred taxes are not provided for undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately $99.8 million which are intended to be reinvested outside of the U.S. Accordingly, no provision for foreign withholding taxes associated with a distribution of those earnings has been made. We estimate that, upon distribution of our share of these earnings, we would be subject to withholding taxes of approximately $5.0 million as of September 30, 2023. We provided deferred income taxes on all undistributed earnings from Cash Converters.\nThe following table presents a roll-forward of unrecognized tax benefits:\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nBeginning balance $ 3,568 $ 4,763 $ 3,085\nIncrease for tax positions taken during a prior period 396 547 2,135\nDecrease for settlement for tax positions taken during a prior period (259) - -\nDecrease for tax positions as a result of the lapse of the statute of limitations (412) (1,742) (457)\nEnding balance $ 3,293 $ 3,568 $ 4,763\nAll of the above unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact our effective tax rate for the respective period of each ending balance. The statute of limitations will expire within the next twelve months with respect to approximately $0.8 million of foreign uncertain tax positions. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. During 2023, the Company recognized income tax expense of $0.2 million offset by the reversal of previously accrued interest and penalties of $0.4 million due to the lapse of the statute of limitations on the associated tax position and an income tax benefit of $0.8 million during 2022 and an income tax expense of $0.3 million during 2021, related to interest and penalties. The total amount of accrued interest and penalties was $0.7 million, $1.0 million and $1.8 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nWe are subject to U.S., Mexico, Canada, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Peru and the Netherlands income taxes as well as income taxes levied by various state and local jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to examinations by tax authorities for years before the tax year ended September 30, 2016. We believe that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.\nNOTE 12: LEASES\nThe table below presents balances of our lease assets and liabilities and their balance sheet locations for both operating and financing leases:\n(in thousands) September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022\nLease assets:\nOperating lease right-of-use assets Right-of-use assets, net $ 234,388 $ 221,405\nFinancing lease assets Other assets, net 2,178 181\nTotal lease assets $ 236,566 $ 221,586\nLease liabilities:\nCurrent:\nOperating lease liabilities Operating lease liabilities, current $ 57,182 $ 52,334\nFinancing lease liabilities Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities 530 37\nTotal current lease liabilities $ 57,712 $ 52,371\nNon-current:\nOperating Lease liabilities Operating lease liabilities $ 193,187 $ 180,756\nFinancing lease liabilities Other long-term liabilities 1,715 148\nTotal non-current lease liabilities $ 194,902 $ 180,904\nTotal lease liabilities $ 252,614 $ 233,275\nThe table below provides major components of our lease costs:\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nOperating lease cost:\nOperating lease cost * $ 74,086 $ 67,414 $ 61,980\nVariable lease cost 16,315 15,229 13,000\nTotal operating lease cost $ 90,401 $ 82,643 $ 74,980\nFinancing lease cost:\nAmortization of financing lease assets $ 327 $ 3 $ -\nInterest on financing lease liabilities 145 1 -\nTotal financing lease cost $ 472 $ 4 $ -\nTotal lease cost $ 90,873 $ 82,647 $ 74,980\n* Includes a reduction for sublease rental income of $3.7 million, $3.6 million and $3.4 million for fiscal years ending September 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nLease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term with variable lease expense recognized in the period in which the costs are incurred. The components of lease expense are included in Store expenses and General and administrative expense, based on the underlying lease use. Cash paid for operating leases was $76.7 million and $72.3 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Cash paid for principal and interest on finance leases was $0.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. There was no cash paid for finance leases for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nThe weighted- average term and discount rates for leases are as follows:\nFiscal Year Ended September 30,\n2023 2022\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years):\nOperating leases 4.97 5.12\nFinancing leases 3.67 4.10\nWeighted-average discount rate:\nOperating leases 8.51 % 8.32 %\nFinancing leases 11.14 % 11.14 %\nAs of September 30, 2023, maturities of lease liabilities under ASC 842 by fiscal year were as follows (in thousands):\nOperating Leases Financing Leases\nFiscal 2024\n$ 75,510 $ 780\nFiscal 2025\n66,798 751\nFiscal 2026\n55,735 751\nFiscal 2027\n41,903 450\nFiscal 2028\n27,005 -\nThereafter 40,592 -\nTotal lease liabilities $ 307,543 $ 2,732\nLess: portion representing Imputed interest 57,174 487\nTotal net lease liabilities $ 250,369 $ 2,245\nLess: current portion 57,182 530\nTotal long term net lease liabilities $ 193,187 $ 1,715\nIn December 2014, we entered into a non-cancelable 13-year operating lease for our corporate offices, with rent payments beginning February 2016 and ending March 2029. Annual rent, net of square footage subsequently terminated as a result of negotiations with the landlord, escalate from $2.5 million at lease inception to $3.9 million in the terminal year of the lease.\nThe lease includes two five-year extension options at the end of the initial lease term. The estimated minimum future rental payments under the lease are approximately $24.4 million as of September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2023, we have subleases in place for a portion of our corporate operating office lease for estimated minimum future sublease payments of approximately $6.3 million.\nWe assessed the recoverability of the right-of-use asset for our corporate office, primarily due to the termination of a significant sublease. We determined the undiscounted cash flows of the relative corporate lease and sublease did not exceed the net book value of the right-of-use asset. We then determined the fair value of the corporate lease and sublease did not exceed the book value of the right-of-use asset, and an impairment charge of $4.3 million was recorded in fiscal year 2023 to Impairment of other assets in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe following table presents our corporate office lease measured at fair value as a result of the aforementioned impairment charges aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which measurements fall on a non-recurring basis at September 30, 2023, and the related impairment charge recorded (in thousands):\nFair Value as of September 30, 2023 Fiscal Year Ended 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Impairment Charges\nCorporate office $ - $ - $ 6,233 $ 6,233 $ 4,343\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we entered into cancellable subleases for our Miami office for an estimated minimum future sublease payment of approximately $2.9 million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Miami office lease and sublease were terminated with no fees, and the deposit to the subtenant was returned.\nWe recorded $66.5 million and $69.4 million in non-cash additions to our operating right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We recorded $2.5 million in non-cash additions to our finance right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for the year ended September 30, 2023.\nNOTE 13: CONTINGENCIES\nCurrently, and from time to time, we are involved in various claims, disputes, lawsuits, investigations, and legal and regulatory proceedings. We accrue for contingencies if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Because these matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, assessing contingencies requires judgments and is highly subjective about future events, and the amount of resulting loss may differ from these estimates. We do not believe the resolution of any particular matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nNOTE 14: SEGMENT INFORMATION\nOur operations are primarily managed on a geographical basis and consist of four reportable segments. The factors for determining our reportable segments include the manner in which our chief operating decision maker (CODM) evaluates performance for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance.\nWe currently report our segments as follows:\nU.S. Pawn - All pawn activities in the United States.\nLatin America Pawn - All pawn activities in Mexico and other parts of Latin America.\nCash Converters - Represents our equity interest in the net loss (income) of Cash Converters. Our equity in Cash Converterss net loss was $28.5 million in fiscal 2023, which includes $32.4 million of our share of their non-cash goodwill impairment charge.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nIn connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2023. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2023. We believe the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows as of the dates, and for the periods, presented in conformity with GAAP.\nManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement, under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d(f) under the Exchange Act) is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (a) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets, (b) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, (c) provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorization of management and the Board of Directors, and (d) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nIn connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023 based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that assessment, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2023.\nOur internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023 has been audited by our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing below.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that, in the aggregate, have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Internal Controls\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be met. Limitations inherent in any control system include the following:\nJudgments in decision-making can be faulty, and control and process breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes.\nControls can be circumvented by individuals, acting alone or in collusion with others, or by management override.\nThe design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.\nOver time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with associated policies or procedures.\nThe design of a control system must reflect the fact that resources are constrained, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.\nBecause of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nStockholders and Board of Directors\nEZCORP, Inc.\nRollingwood, Texas\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited EZCORP, Inc.s (the Companys) internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated November 15, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ BDO USA, P.C.\nDallas, Texas\nNovember 15, 2023 ITEM 9B.

These requirements generally relate to the composition of the board and its committees. For example, the rules require the following:\nA majority of the directors must be independent (Rule 5605(b)(1));\nThe audit committee must have at least three members, each of whom must be independent (Rule 5605(c)(2));\nExecutive officer compensation must be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, by either (1) a majority of the independent directors or (2) a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors (Rule 5605(d)); and\nDirector nominations must be selected, or recommended for the boards selection, by either (1) a majority of the independent directors or (2) a nominations committee comprised solely of independent directors (Rule 5605(e)).\nRule 5615(c)(2), however, provides that a Controlled Company is exempt from the requirement to have a majority of independent directors and from the requirements to have independent director oversight over executive compensation and director nominations. The Listing Rules define a Controlled Company as a company of which more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, a group or another company. EZCORP is a Controlled Company within this meaning by virtue of the fact that 100% of the outstanding Class B Voting Common Stock (the only class of voting securities outstanding) is held of record solely by MS Pawn Limited Partnership and beneficially by Phillip E. Cohen.\nThe Company has relied on the Controlled Company exemptions in the past, but is not currently relying on such exemptions. The controlling shareholder or the Board may implement changes in the future that would again require the Company to rely on the Controlled Company exemptions under the Nasdaq Listing Rules.\nCommittees of the Board of Directors - The Board of Directors maintains the following committees to assist it in its oversight responsibilities. The current membership of each committee is indicated in the list of directors set forth under Board of Directors above.\nAudit Committee - The Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibility to provide oversight with respect to our financial statements and reports and other disclosures provided to stockholders, the system of internal controls, the audit process and legal and ethical compliance.

The Audit Committee also selects, engages, compensates and oversees our independent auditor and pre-approves all services to be performed by the independent auditing firm.\nThe Audit Committee has further responsibility for overseeing our risk management and compliance processes. In carrying out that responsibility, the Audit Committee ensures that adequate policies and procedures have been designed and implemented to (a) manage and monitor significant risks the Company faces, including financial, operational, security, IT and cybersecurity, legal, compliance and regulatory risks; and (b) assure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including data privacy requirements.\nThe Audit Committee is comprised entirely of directors who satisfy the standards of independence described under Part III, Item 13 - Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence - Director Independence, as well as additional or supplemental independence standards applicable to audit committee members established under applicable law and Nasdaq listing requirements.

The People and Compensation Committee is comprised entirely of directors who satisfy the standards of independence described under Part III, Item 13 - Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence - Director Independence.\nNominating Committee - The Nominating Committee assists the Board with respect to the selection and nomination of candidates for election or appointment to the Board, including making recommendations to the Board regarding the size and composition of the Board and its committees; recommending to the Board the qualifications needed or required of Board members; identifying and evaluating qualified individuals to become Board members; making recommendations to the full Board regarding the nomination of appropriate candidates; and assessing and monitoring each continuing and prospective directors independence and qualification to serve on the Board and its committees. The Nominating Committee is comprised entirely of directors who satisfy the standards of independence described under Part III, Item 13 - Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence - Director Independence.\nEach of three standing committees is governed by a written charter, a copy of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ezcorp.com.\nMeetings and Attendance - The following table sets forth the number of meetings held during fiscal 2023 by the Board of Directors and each committee thereof, as well as the number of times during the year that action was taken by unanimous written consent. Our bylaws currently require the unanimous attendance of all directors in order for a quorum to be present at a meeting of the Board of Directors. In addition to the number of official Board meetings noted below, the Board of Directors also held five other meetings that were not considered official meetings of the Board due to the absence of a quorum.\nAll directors attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board and of the committees on which they served.\nFiscal 2023\nMeetings Held Action by Unanimous Written Consent\nBoard of Directors 7 5\nAudit Committee 4 -\nPeople and Compensation Committee 5 -\nNominating Committee 1 2\nIn addition, during fiscal 2022, the Board of Directors formed and commissioned a Share Buyback Committee, consisting of Mr. Appel, Mr. Given, Mr. Kulas, and Mr. Tillett, for the purpose of reviewing and approving the Companys share repurchase plans.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\nThis Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes our compensation practices and the executive compensation policies, decisions and actions of the People and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors (the Committee). It focuses specifically on compensation earned during fiscal 2023 by the following individuals, referred to as our Named Executive Officers.\nName Position\nLachlan P. Given Chief Executive Officer\nTimothy K. Jugmans Chief Financial Officer\nPhilip E. Cohen Executive Chairman\nJohn Blair Powell, Jr. Chief Operating Officer\nLisa VanRoekel\nChief Human Resources Officer\nExecutive Compensation Philosophy and Program Design\nPhilosophy and Goals - We have designed our executive compensation program to accomplish the following primary goals:\nAttract and retain high performers\nCompensation is competitive to attract and retain high performers\nWhen performance objectives are achieved, resulting pay is competitive with market\nWhen performance is outstanding and exceeds performance objectives, resulting pay is positioned above, and potentially near the top of, the market\nPay for performance The majority of compensation is performance-based (short-and long-term)\nThese performance-based incentives are tied to the achievement of financial and strategic objectives, recognizing company-wide and individual performance\nShareholder alignment The value of equity awards is dependent on our stock performance and the achievement of objective financial goals\nEquity incentives will have the greatest weight in the mix of variable compensation for executives\nLong-term commitment Equity incentive awards vest over multiple years to align executives with the investment horizon of long-term shareholders\nAfter vesting, executives are subject to stock ownership requirements\nThese principles are reflected in the following best-practice features of our executive compensation program:\nWhat We Do What We Dont Do\n\u00fe Emphasize performance-based variable pay \u00fd Generally, no single trigger change-in-control payments\n\u00fe Link significant portion of equity incentive grants to performance goals \u00fd No significant perquisites\n\u00fe Require stock retention by executives and directors \u00fd No hedging or pledging of Company stock\n\u00fe Perform annual risk assessments\n\u00fe Retain an independent compensation consultant\n\u00fe Maintain an incentive clawback policy\nCompensation Components - Total direct compensation is composed of four principal components, each one contributing to the accomplishment of our compensation program goals:\nCompensation Component Description Attract and Retain Pay for Performance Shareholder Alignment Long-term Commitment\nBase salary\nA market-competitive salary to provide a fixed annual cash income\n\u00fc\nShort-term incentives\nAnnual cash incentive opportunity tied to an assessment of annual corporate and business unit financial performance, as well as individual contributions\n\u00fc\n\u00fc\n\u00fc\nLong-term incentives\nEquity incentive grants with vesting tied to achievement of earnings-based goals and continued employment\n\u00fc\n\u00fc\n\u00fc\n\u00fc\nExecutive retirement\n(US only)\nAnnual retirement plan contributions that vest over three years\n\u00fc\n\u00fc\nThe Committee reviews the executive pay mix on an annual basis. The Committee does not target a fixed percentage allocation among the compensation components, but rather aims to provide the majority of executive officer compensation opportunities in the form of at-risk incentive compensation.\nBenchmarking and Peer Group Data\nTo attract and retain the best executives for key management positions, we provide compensation opportunities that are competitive based on peer group and survey data. We do not target any specific pay percentile for our executive officers. It is important to note, however, that the majority of pay opportunities for our top executives are incentive-based and that actual realizable compensation is heavily dependent upon actual business results. See Executive Compensation Philosophy and Program Design above. Failure to achieve targeted results could result in realized compensation being below the competitive benchmarks. Conversely, our incentive compensation programs provide opportunities for compensation to exceed the competitive benchmarks if specified objectives are achieved at targeted levels or higher. The Committee believes that actual realizable compensation for our top executives is well aligned with our performance.\nThe Committee asks its independent compensation consultant to conduct an annual competitive compensation review to benchmark compensation for executive officers. Mercer (US) Inc. (Mercer), the Committees independent compensation consultant, delivered its Fiscal 2023 Executive Compensation Competitive Market Assessment (the FY23 Mercer Executive Compensation Report) to the Committee in August 2022 in connection with the Committees review and evaluation of the executive compensation program and pay levels for fiscal 2023. For that report, Mercer collected competitive pay data for a peer group of 13 publicly traded companies that were reviewed and approved by the Committee in May 2022.\nThere is only one publicly traded company in the marketplace with which we directly compete, FirstCash Holdings, Inc. As a result, the Committee uses a set of similarly-sized companies from relevant industries that serve similar customer bases, operate in the retail or consumer finance industries and typically have similar operating dynamics as the Company. The Committee believes this approach appropriately reflects the diverse labor market for executive talent in which we compete and presents a reasonable reference for evaluating the competitiveness of our executive compensation levels and practices.\nThe fiscal 2023 peer group consisted of the following companies:\nPeer Company Stock Symbol Primary Business\nThe Aarons Company, Inc.\nAAN\nHome Furnishing Retail\nAtlanticus Holdings Corporation\nATLC\nConsumer Finance\nThe Cato Corporation\nCATO\nApparel Retail\nConns, Inc. CONN Computer and Electronics Retail\nCURO Group Holdings Corp. CURO Consumer Finance\nElevate Credit, Inc.\nELVT\nConsumer Finance\nEnova International, Inc. ENVA Consumer Finance\nFirstCash Holdings, Inc. FCFS Consumer Finance - Pawn Operator\nLendingClub Corporation LC Consumer Finance\nMoneyGram International, Inc. MGI Data Processing and Outsourced Services - Fintech\nOportun Financial Corporation OPRT Consumer Finance\nRegional Management Corp. RM Consumer Finance\nWorld Acceptance Corporation WRLD Consumer Finance\nThis group was the same as the peer group used in fiscal 2022, except that three companies were dropped (Cardtronics Inc. and GreenSky, Inc. due to their having been acquired, and Rent-A-Center, Inc. due to its revenue size being outside the range of reasonable comparability) and four companies were added (Atlanticus Holdings Corporation and Elevate Credit, Inc. to maintain focus on the Consumer Finance industry, and The Aarons Company, Inc. and The Cato Corporation to expand exposure to retail companies with comparable business models). When the peer group was approved by the Committee, Mercer noted that the Company was at the 43rd percentile of the peer group in terms of revenue size and at the 19th percentile in terms of market capitalization.\nTo benchmark our executive compensation, Mercer used peer group data from the most recently available proxy filings (CEO and CFO positions and other executive positions where available) and its own executive compensation survey data (for all executive officer positions). Additional data from other published surveys was used as secondary reference points. (Note - The FY23 Mercer Executive Compensation Report did not include any benchmarking information for the Executive Chairman position, as our Executive Chairman, Mr. Cohen, is subject to a special multi-year compensation arrangement that was approved by the full Board in September 2019 and renewed on the same terms for fiscal 2023. See Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Summary of Fiscal 2019 Compensation Actions - Executive Chairman in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2019.)\nThe FY23 Mercer Executive Compensation Report contained the following general observations, which the Committee took into consideration in evaluating and approving executive compensation for fiscal 2023:\nTotal cash compensation (at target levels) for our executive officers as a group approximates the 62nd percentile, with individual executive officers each approximating or exceeding the 50th percentile.\nLong-term incentive compensation (at target levels) is less competitive at the 30th percentile, with half of our executive officers below the 50th percentile.\nAs a whole, total direct compensation (cash compensation plus long-term incentive) for our executive officers is at the 45th percentile, with all but two of the executive officers approximating or exceeding the 50th percentile.\nRelative to the prior year, both long-term incentive compensation and total direct compensation compared to the market have improved slightly, reflecting the Committees emphasis on long-term compensation.\nComponents of Compensation and Fiscal 2023 Executive Compensation Actions\nOur executive compensation program consists of four main elements: base salaries, short-term cash incentive opportunities, long-term incentive opportunities (generally paid in the form of equity awards) and other benefits, including healthcare and retirement. Each of these components is discussed in more detail below, along with the compensation actions that were taken during fiscal 2023.\nBase Salary\nOur primary objective with respect to base salary levels is to provide sufficient fixed cash income to attract and retain experienced leaders in a competitive market. The base salaries of our executive officers are reviewed and adjusted (if appropriate) annually to reflect, among other things, individual performance, review of market data, experience in role, macro-economic conditions and internal equity.\nThe following table shows, for each Named Executive Officer, the base salaries that were in effect for fiscal 2023 and 2022:\nNamed Executive Officer Fiscal 2023 Base Salary\nFiscal 2022 Base Salary\nIncrease\nLachlan P. Given (1)\n$ 750,000 $ 750,000 0%\nTimothy K. Jugmans (2)\n$ 450,000 $ 450,000 0%\nPhilip E. Cohen $ 1,500,000 $ 1,500,000 0%\nJohn Blair Powell, Jr. (3)\n$ 550,000 $ 550,000 0%\nLisa VanRoekel (4)\n$ 410,000 $ 410,000 0%\n(1) Mr. Given was appointed Co-Interim Chief Executive Officer effective January 12, 2022 and Chief Executive Officer effective March 3, 2022. The amount shown for fiscal 2022 represents his annualized base salary for the CEO position, which was made effective January 12, 2022.\n(2) In September 2021, the Committee approved a base salary for Mr. Jugmans of $420,000 for fiscal 2022 and indicated that it expected to approve a further increase to $450,000 for fiscal 2023 to better align Mr. Jugmans compensation with the competitive market benchmarks. In February 2022, in recognition of Mr. Jugmans performance, particularly in the context of the CEO change that occurred in January 2022, the Committee approved a base salary increase to $450,000 (with retroactive effect from January 12, 2022), essentially accelerating the increase planned for fiscal 2023.\n(3) In October 2021, the Committee approved a fiscal 2022 base salary for Mr. Powell, who was serving as President, Global Pawn at that time, of $450,000. In January 2022, Mr. Powell was appointed Co-Interim Chief Executive Officer (effective January 12, 2022), and he served in that position with Mr. Given until March 3, 2022, when he was appointed Chief Operating Officer. The amount shown for fiscal 2022 represents the annualized base salary for the COO position, which was made effective January 12, 2022.\n(4) In September 2021, the Committee approved a base salary for Ms. VanRoekel of $350,000 for fiscal 2022. In February 2022, in recognition of Ms. VanRoekels increased responsibilities, the Committee approved a base salary increase to $410,000 (with retroactive effect from January 12, 2022).\nIn October 2023, the Committee determined that the fiscal 2024 base salaries for the Named Executive Officers would be as follows: Mr,. Given, $750,000 (no increase); Mr. Jugmans, $475,000 (5.6% increase); Mr. Powell, $600,000 (9.1% increase); Mr. Cohen, $1,500,000 (no increase); and Ms. VanRoekel, $410,000 (no increase).\nAnnual Short-Term Incentive\nOur executive officers, as well as other key Team Members, are eligible to participate in our annual short-term incentive (STI) plan. The plan is designed to provide financial reward contingent on achievement of annual corporate and business unit financial results, as well as personal objectives tied to our strategic goals.\nThe following is a summary of the terms of the fiscal 2023 STI plan, which the Committee approved in September 2022 after deliberations regarding the appropriate performance measures:\nThe fiscal 2023 STI plan provides cash bonus opportunities based on achievement of specified performance goals. The bonus opportunity for each participant was determined based on a designated target amount, a business performance modifier based on the achievement of specified EBITDA-based performance goals for the Company as a whole (consolidated) and each business unit, and an assessment of individual performance.\nParticipants were assigned to one of two STI Incentive Pools - Consolidated Executive Officer and Consolidated - and the total target amount for each pool equaled the aggregate designated target amount for the participants in that pool. The Consolidated Pool also includes three sub-pools based on individual business unit performance.\nThe plan was subject to a Company Performance Gate, such that no pool would be funded if the Company did not achieve the minimum level of Adjusted EBITDA required for a corporate-level payout.\nIf the Company Performance Gate was achieved, then each pool was funded in a range from 0% to 150% of the total target amount assigned to that pool, based on the level of achievement of the applicable performance goal for that pool.\nThe performance goal for both the Consolidated Executive Officer pool and the Consolidated pool was based on the consolidated Adjusted EBITDA shown in the Board-approved budget for fiscal 2023 (excluding any impact of our investment in Cash Converters). The threshold level for each pool (i.e, the performance needed to achieve 50% funding) was set at 85% of the designated performance goal for that pool, and the maximum level (i.e., the performance needed to achieve 150% funding) was set at 115% of the designated performance goal. The Company Performance Gate was set at 85% of the consolidated performance goal.\nThe Committee retained discretionary authority to make adjustments to the reported EBITDA as it, in its sole discretion, determined to be necessary, appropriate or desirable to take into consideration special events or other circumstances reasonably beyond managements control (referred to as Adjusted EBITDA).\nEach participants bonus amount was funded out of their assigned pool based on an evaluation of their individual performance against objectives specified at the beginning of the year. For all participants other than the executive officers, the final bonus amounts were determined by management. For the executive officers (other than the CEO), the final bonus amounts were recommended by the CEO and approved by the Committee. The final bonus amount for the CEO was determined by the Committee.\nThe following table sets forth the fiscal 2023 STI target amount for each of the Named Executive Officers:\nNamed Executive Officer (1) Fiscal 2023 STI Target Amount\nTarget Amount as % of Base Salary\nLachlan P. Given $ 1,125,000 150%\nTimothy K. Jugmans $ 450,000 100%\nJohn Blair Powell, Jr. $ 550,000 100%\nLisa VanRoekel\n$ 246,000 60%\n(1) Mr. Cohen, in his role as Executive Chairman, is not a participant in the STI plan, but is subject to a separate incentive opportunity specified in the terms of his employment. Pursuant to those terms, he had the opportunity to earn an incentive award of up to $1,500,000 (100% of his base salary). See Executive Chairman Incentive Award below.\nThe amount of each Named Executive Officers STI bonus opportunity at the Threshold, Target and Maximum levels is set forth in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards table under Incentive Plan Based Awards below.\nAll of the Named Executive Officers were assigned to the Consolidated Executive Officer pool. During fiscal 2023, the Company achieved 111% of the specified consolidated performance goal.\nIn addition to the noted financial performance, management was successful in completing specific initiatives that were designed to drive progress across the key strategic focus areas for fiscal 2023, which included:\nStrengthening our core pawn business;\nDriving cost efficiency;\nImproving our Team Member experience;\nImproving and expanding our customer engagement through innovation and growth;\nModernizing our IT and data management systems;\nEnhancing and maintaining our culture of risk management and compliance, and\nDeveloping the foundations of a comprehensive and integrated sustainability program.\nThese strategic focus areas provided the foundation for delivering strong financial performance through increased earnings and efficient balance sheet management.\nFollowing a consideration of all of these factors, the Committee approved a funding level of 123% for the Consolidated Executive Officer pool, which included all of the Named Executive Officers. The specific bonus amount approved for each Named Executive Officers is indicated in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column in the Summary Compensation Table below. Those amounts were calculated as follows:\nNamed Executive Officer (1) Target Amount STI Payout Percent of Target Awarded\nLachlan P. Given $ 1,125,000 $ 1,383,750 123%\nTimothy K. Jugmans $ 450,000 $ 553,500 123%\nJohn Blair Powell, Jr. $ 550,000 $ 676,500 123%\nLisa VanRoekel\n$ 246,000 $ 302,580 123%\n(1) Mr. Cohens bonus payout was calculated as described below under Executive Chairman Incentive Award.\nIn October 2023, the Committee approved the STI plan for fiscal 2024. The fiscal 2024 STI plan contains the same basic design elements as the fiscal 2023 plan. For fiscal 2024, the Target Amounts for each of the Named Executive Officers will be as follows: Mr. Given, $1,125,000; Mr. Jugmans, $475,000; Mr. Powell, $600,000; and Ms. VanRoekel, $246,000.\nLong-Term Incentives\nGeneral - Long-term incentive (LTI) compensation, in the form of equity awards, is a key component in our executive compensation program, helping to encourage long-term commitment, shareholder alignment and long-term performance orientation. The value of equity awards over time bears a direct relationship to the price of our stock and the gain or loss experienced by our stockholders.\nAll of our executive officers are eligible to receive LTI awards. We structure our LTI compensation program to place greater emphasis on long-term performance that enhances stockholder value. Many of our peers have a significant time-based vesting component to their long-term awards, while 80% of our LTI awards are subject to performance-based vesting. To further emphasize the long-term nature of these awards, 100% of the LTI awards vest at the end of a three-year performance period, rather than a prorated vesting each year during the performance period. The Committee believes this structure incentivizes and rewards longer-term vision and strategies, and provides a balance to our short-term programs, which are focused on annual performance.\nWe are currently issuing LTI awards under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2022 LTI Plan). Under the terms of the 2022 LTI Plan, all awards must be approved by the full Board of Directors, following recommendation by the Committee.\nGrant frequency - Although LTI awards may be made at any time as determined by the Committee and approved by the Board, the Committee generally considers new LTI grants for executive officers and other key employees on an annual basis. Given that these annual LTI awards are intended to incentivize performance over the full designated performance period, the Committee considers it appropriate to use the stock price at the beginning of the performance period in determining the number of shares or units to be granted. In the Committees view, this methodology, consistently applied, neutralizes the stock price as a factor impacting the timing of awards.\nFiscal 2023 Actions - For fiscal 2023, the Committee took the following actions regarding LTI awards:\nGrant of fiscal 2023 LTI awards - In September 2022, the Committee approved the design and structure of the fiscal 2023 LTI awards and authorized the issuance of awards to the executive officers and other key employees. Those awards were granted in October 2022 following approval by the Board. The number of units awarded to each participant was determined by dividing the participants designated LTI target amount by $7.71, the closing trading price of our Class A Non-Voting Common Stock on September 30, 2022. The following table shows the fiscal 2023 LTI awards for the Named Executive Officers (other than Mr. Cohen, who is subject to a separate incentive program and is not eligible for LTI awards):\nNamed Executive Officer\nFiscal 2023 LTI Target Amount Number of Units\nLachlan P. Given $ 2,000,000 259,403\nTimothy K. Jugmans $ 500,000 64,850\nJohn Blair Powell, Jr. $ 825,000 107,003\nLisa VanRoekel\n$ 328,000 42,542\nThe awards took the form of restricted stock units with the following terms:\nPerformance will be measured over a three-year performance period (fiscal 2023, fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025).\nVesting for 80% of the units awarded is subject to performance measured against specified net income targets - 20% of the units are allocated to each of the three years in the performance period (with each year measured separately based on an annual Adjusted Net Income performance goal), and 20% of the units are subject to a cumulative performance goal based on Adjusted Net Income growth over the three-year performance period.\nThe Committee continues to consider net income to be the long-term shareholder value metric against which management should be measured, as it reflects the scaling of profitability in a fiscally robust way. Net income takes into account the full bottom-line performance and growth of the Company, including a prudent capital structure; it is the metric that primarily drives our stock price, closely aligning managements interests with those of our shareholders; it is one of the three primary financial goals in the Companys Strategic Goals and Measures framework; and it is less susceptible to manipulation, as EPS often is with debt-financed share buybacks that potentially put financial position at risk.\nThe remaining 20% of the units are subject to time-based vesting, contingent only on continuous active employment through the end of the performance period.\nThe number of performance-based units (whether annual or cumulative) that will be available to vest at the end of the performance period will range from 50% (assuming minimum threshold performance is achieved) and 150%, depending on the level of performance target achievement. There is no bonus unit opportunity for the time-based units, and they will vest at 100% only if the continuous active employment condition is met; otherwise, they will be forfeited.\nThe Committee believes that this LTI award structure (which was new for fiscal 2023) introduces two important features into the Companys LTI awards. Since fiscal 2020, LTI performance has been measured on an annual basis, relying largely on the three-year cliff vest feature to add the necessary long-term focus. The Committee considered this structure to be appropriate during the height of the COVID pandemic when long-term forecasting was difficult if not impossible. With the post-COVID recovery now largely complete going into fiscal 2023, the Committee considered it appropriate to add in a multi-year performance measure, while at the same time retaining some portion of the separate annual performance feature. The Committee believes this structure aligns with the Companys business strategy by maintaining executive focus on each years results but also driving long-term, multi-year performance. Additionally, the Committee determined, with the advice of its independent consultant, that the inclusion of a relatively small time-based element better aligns the Companys equity awards with market comparables.\nVesting of fiscal 2021 awards - As described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2021 (the 2021 Annual Report), the fiscal 2021 LTI awards were approved in February 2021. The basic design of the fiscal 2021 awards is similar to the fiscal 2023 awards discussed above, except that 100% of the units awarded are subject to performance-based vesting (divided equally among the three years in the performance period, fiscal 2021, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023). As reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022 (the 2022 Annual Report), the Committee previously determined that 150% of the units allocated to each of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022 were available for vesting for those participants whose employment continued through fiscal 2023.\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Companys Adjusted Net Income performance ($69.8 million) exceeded the specified performance goal at the target level, and in November 2023, the Committee determined that 135% of the units allocated to fiscal 2023 (along with the units allocated to fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022 as described above) were vested for those participants whose employment continued through the end of fiscal 2023. The resulting vesting for the Named Executive Officers was as follows: Mr. Given, 172,962 units; Mr. Jugmans, 85,327 units; Mr. Powell, 86,482 units; and Ms. VanRoekel, 80,716 units.\nSecond-year performance of fiscal 2022 awards - As described in our 2022 Annual Report, the fiscal 2022 LTI awards were approved in October 2021. The basic design of the fiscal 2022 awards is substantially similar to the fiscal 2021 awards discussed above, except that the three-year performance period consists of fiscal 2022, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024. As reported in the 2022 Annual Report, the Committee determined in November 2022 that 150% of the units allocated to fiscal 2022 were available for vesting for those participants whose employment continues through fiscal 2024.\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Companys Adjusted Net Income performance ($69.8 million) exceeded the specified performance goal at the target level, and in November 2023, the Committee determined that 147% of the units allocated to fiscal 2023 were now available for vesting for those participants whose employment continued through the end of fiscal 2024. For the Named Executive Officers, this includes 80,654 units for Mr. Given (including 25,787 bonus units); 28,580 units for Mr. Jugmans (including 9,138 bonus units); 46,552 units for Mr. Powell (including 14,884 bonus units); and 20,354 units for Ms. VanRoekel (including 6,508 bonus units).\nFirst-year performance of fiscal 2023 awards - During fiscal 2023, the Companys Adjusted Net Income performance ($69.8 million) exceeded the specified performance goal at the target level, and in November 2023, the Committee determined that 147% of the units allocated to fiscal 2023 are now available for vesting for those participants whose employment continued through the end of fiscal 2025. For the Named Executive Officers, this includes 76,265 units for Mr. Given (including 24,384 bonus units); 19,066 units for Mr. Jugmans (including 6,096 bonus units); 31,459 units for Mr. Powell (including 10,058 bonus units); and 12,508 units for Ms. VanRoekel (including 3,999 bonus units).\nGrant of fiscal 2024 Awards - In October 2023, the Committee approved the plan design for the fiscal 2024 LTI awards. The approved design is substantially identical to the fiscal 2023 awards described above, except that the three-year performance period covers fiscal 2024, fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026. The fiscal 2024 LTI awards were granted in November 2023 following approval by the Board. The number of units awarded to each participant was determined by dividing the participants designated LTI target amount by $8.25, the closing trading price of our Class A Non-Voting Common Stock on September 29, 2023. The following table shows the fiscal 2024 LTI awards for the Named Executive Officers (other than Mr. Cohen, who is subject to a separate incentive program and is not eligible for LTI awards):\nNamed Executive Officer (1)\nFiscal 2024 LTI Target Amount Number of Units\nLachlan P. Given\n$ 2,600,000 315,151\nTimothy K. Jugmans\n$ 700,000 84,848\nJohn Blair Powell, Jr. $ 1,200,000 145,454\nLisa VanRoekel\n$ 350,000 42,424\n(1) In October 2023, the Committee approved increases in the LTI target amounts for Mr. Given (from $2,000,000 to $2,600,000), Mr. Jugmans (from $500,000 to $700,000), Mr. Powell (from $825,000 to $1,200,000) and Ms. VanRoekel (from $328,000 to $350,000). These changes better align the executives long-term incentive compensation and total direct compensation with peer group executives in comparable positions (at the 25th percentile and 43rd percentile, respectively, for Mr. Given; below the 25th percentile and at the 41st percentile, respectively, for Mr. Jugmans; at the 50th percentile and 58th percentile, respectively, for Mr. Powell; and at the 34th percentile and 68th percentile, respectively, for Ms. VanRoekel), and is consistent with the Companys pay-for-performance philosophy and emphasis on long-term compensation.\nExecutive Chairman Incentive Award\nAs Executive Chairman, Mr. Cohen has an incentive compensation opportunity of $1,500,000 per year (100% of base salary), awarded in the form of cash-settled phantom stock units (Units) tied to the trading price of the Companys Class A Common Stock, as follows:\nAward - At the beginning of a fiscal year (the Performance Year), the number of Units awarded is determined by dividing $1,500,000 by the stock price at the close of the immediately preceding fiscal year.\nVesting - The awarded Units vest at the end of the Performance Year so long as the Company Performance Gate under the Companys STI plan for the Performance Year has been achieved. The Company Performance Gate is the level of performance (generally measured in terms of Adjusted EBITDA) needed to achieve any payout under the STI plan. Even if the Company Performance Gate is achieved, the Committee in its discretion may reduce the number of Units that vest based upon the Committees evaluation of Mr. Cohens achievement of individual performance objectives. Conversely, if the Company Performance Gate is not achieved, the Committee in its discretion may choose to vest some or all of the Units based an evaluation of Mr. Cohens achievement of individual performance objectives.\nPayout - The vested Units will be paid out in two installments. The first installment will be paid as soon as practicable after the end of the Performance Year and will be an amount of cash equal to 50% of the vested Units multiplied by the stock price at the end of the Performance Year. The second installment will be paid out at the end of the next fiscal year and will be an amount of cash equal to 50% of the vested Units multiplied by the stock price at that time.\nAt the beginning of fiscal 2023, Mr. Cohen received 194,552 Units (the FY23 Units), which was calculated by dividing the bonus opportunity ($1,500,000) by $7.71, the closing trading price of our Class A Non-Voting Common Stock on September 30, 2022. In September 2023, the Committee reviewed and evaluated Mr. Cohens individual performance during fiscal 2023, noting Mr. Cohens valuable contributions in key strategic areas, including the following:\nProviding leadership and mentorship to the CEO, COO and CFO;\nProviding counsel and advice on development and execution of strategic plan;\nProviding direction, high-level involvement and support on key growth initiatives, including acquisitions, strategic investments and partnerships and denovo developments;\nProviding counsel and operational guidance to improve store-level performance and Team Member engagement; and\nProviding thought leadership and guidance on financing and capital allocation strategies.\nAs noted above, the Committee has determined that the Company Performance Gate under the fiscal 2023 STI plan has been achieved. See Annual Short-Term Incentive above. Consequently, and taking into consideration the Committees evaluation of Mr. Cohens individual performance, the Committee approved the vesting of 100% of the FY23 Units. Under the terms of Mr. Cohens incentive opportunity, 50% of those Units (or 97,276 Units) will be paid out on a per-Unit value of $8.25 (the closing trading price of our Class A Common Stock on September 29, 2023), translating to a cash payout of $802,527. The remaining 50% of the FY22 Units (92,976 Units) will be paid at the end of fiscal 2024 based on the closing trading price of our Class A Non-Voting Common Stock at that time.\nIn October 2023, the Committee approved an increase in Mr. Cohens incentive compensation opportunity to $1,750,000, and for fiscal 2024, Mr. Cohen received 212,121 Units (the FY24 Units), which was calculated by dividing the bonus opportunity ($1,750,000) by $8.25, the closing trading price of our Class A Non-Voting Common Stock on September 29, 2023. The FY24 Units will be subject to the vesting and payout terms described above.\nSupplemental Executive Retirement Plan\nWe provide selected executives with a non-qualified Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) to offer a competitive benefit and to assist in offsetting potential impacts of contribution limitations applicable to our 401(k) retirement savings plan. For fiscal 2023, the Committee approved SERP contributions for each of the executive officers equal to 10% of base salary. This resulted in the following SERP contributions for each of the Named Executive Officers (other than Mr. Cohen who is not eligible for SERP contributions):\nNamed Executive Officer Fiscal 2023 SERP Contribution\nLachlan P. Given\n$ 75,000\nTimothy K. Jugmans\n$ 45,000\nJohn Blair Powell, Jr.\n$ 55,000\nLisa VanRoekel\n$ 41,000\nIn October 2023, the Committee approved fiscal 2024 SERP contributions equal to 10% of base salary for each of the executive officers (other than Mr. Cohen). For the Named Executive Officers, those contributions were $75,000 for Mr. Given, $47,500 for Mr. Jugmans, $60,000 for Mr. Powell and $41,000 for Ms. VanRoekel.\nOther Benefits and Perquisites\nThe executive officers participate in other benefit plans on the same terms as other Team Members. These plans include medical, dental, life insurance and our 401(k) retirement savings plan. In addition, we provide supplemental healthcare benefits to our executive officers. The amount of that benefit for the Named Executive Officers is included in the All Other Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table below.\nExecutive Compensation Governance and Process\nComposition of the People and Compensation Committee\nThe People and Compensation Committee is comprised of four members - Mr. Lagos (Chair), Mr. Appel, Ms. Arnold and Mr. Tillett - each of whom is an independent director. See Part III, Item 10 - Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance - Board of Directors.\nRole of the Committee\nThe Board of Directors has authorized the Committee to establish the compensation programs for all executive officers and to provide oversight for compliance with our compensation philosophy. The Committee delegates the day-to-day administration of the compensation plans to management and retains responsibility for ensuring that the plan administration is consistent with our policies.\nAnnually, the Committee sets the compensation for our executive officers, including objectives and awards under incentive plans (subject to approval of LTI awards by the Board of Directors). The Committee also reviews all other proposed LTI awards and makes recommendations to the Board of Directors on proposed LTI awards and the appropriate compensation for the non-employee directors.\nThe Committee also oversees the Companys human capital management (HCM) strategy, policies and activities, including succession planning and corresponding individual development in order to maintain the talent necessary to fulfill our operational and strategic objectives; diversity and inclusion initiatives; Team Member engagement; and assessing the overall effectiveness of our HCM programs. For more information on the Committee's role, see Part III, Item 10 - Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance - Corporate Governance - Committees of the Board - People and Compensation Committee, as well as the Committee's charter, which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.ezcorp.com.\nRole of Management\nThe Committee receives data regarding compensation trends, succession plans, issues and recommendations from management. Members of management, including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Human Resources Officer and Chief Legal Officer, attend Committee meetings at the invitation of the Committee. In addition, our Chief Executive Officer provides input on individual performance and recommendations regarding compensation adjustments to the Committee for executive officer positions other than his own.\nRole of the Independent Compensation Consultant\nUnder its charter, the Committee has sole authority to retain, terminate, obtain advice from, oversee and compensate its outside advisors, including its compensation consultant. We have provided appropriate funding to the Committee to do so.\nSince March 2020, the Committee has retained Mercer as its independent compensation consultant. The Committees independent compensation consultant reports directly to the Committee, and the Committee may replace its independent compensation consultant or hire additional consultants at any time. The Committees independent compensation consultant communicates with, and attends meetings of, the Committee as requested.\nThe Committee annually evaluates the independence of its independent compensation consultant in providing executive compensation consulting services, and to date has found no conflict of interest with respect to Mercer.\nDuring fiscal 2023, Mercer, among other things, advised the Committee on the principal aspects of our executive compensation program, updated the Committee on evolving best practices and provided market information and analysis regarding the competitiveness of our program design and award values.\nCompensation Risk\nThe Committee continually monitors our general compensation practices, specifically the design, administration and assessment of our incentive plans, to identify any components, measurement factors or potential outcomes that might create an incentive for excessive risk-taking detrimental to the Company. The Committee has determined that our compensation plans and policies do not encourage excessive risk-taking.\nOur executive compensation program provides a balance of short-term and long-term incentives that reward achievement of profitable, consistent and sustainable results. These include:\nAnnual incentive compensation tied to achievement of profitable Company or business unit performance (as measured by consolidated and/or business unit EBITDA);\nMeaningful long-term equity incentive opportunities that are substantially performance-based and provide an incentive to deliver long-term growth in stockholder value as a result of sustained earnings growth.\nWe maintain the following policies to mitigate compensation risk:\nCompensation Recovery Policy - The Board of Directors has adopted a Compensation Recovery Policy that complies with the requirements of the Nasdaq Listing Rules. Under the policy, the Company generally is required to take reasonably prompt action to recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation from the persons subject to the policy (including the executive officers) if the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the Companys material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements. Erroneously Awarded Compensation is the amount of incentive compensation received by a covered person in excess of the amount that would have been received had it been determined based on the restated amounts. A copy of the Compensation Recovery Policy, which became effective on August 1, 2023, is filed as Exhibit 97 to this Report.\nAnti-Hedging Policy - We maintain a policy prohibiting the trading of derivative securities related to, or engaging in short sales of, our stock by members of the Board of Directors, executive officers or any other persons associated or affiliated with the Company (through employment, contractual relationship or otherwise) who are designated from time to time by the Board of Directors. For purposes of the policy, a derivative security is any option, warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right or similar right with an exercise or conversion privilege at a price related to our stock, or similar securities with a value derived from the value of our stock; and a short sale is any sale of stock that the seller does not own or any sale that is consummated by the delivery of stock borrowed by, or for the account of, the seller. The Board believes that this policy, by preventing the shifting of the risks of ownership of Company stock, helps to align the interests of management with the interests of the other Company stockholders.\nExecutive Share Retention Policy - The Board of Directors has adopted stock ownership requirements applicable to the members of the Board of Directors and the executive officers. Pursuant to those requirements, each non-executive member of the Board of Directors and each executive officer is required to hold a number of shares of Class A Non-Voting Common Stock having a market value equal to the applicable Required Multiple of the annual retainer fee (in the case of the non-executive directors) or base salary (in the case of the executive officers). The Required Multiple is 4X for the non-executive directors and the CEO, 2X for the Executive Chairman and 1X for the other executive officers. Each person subject to the stock ownership requirements is required to hold at least 50% (in the case of the non-executive directors) or 30% (in the case of the executive officers) of each vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units until the required stock ownership amount is satisfied. Thereafter, such person can sell shares (subject to our trading window policy) as long as the required stock ownership amount is maintained. Because each share of Class B Voting Common Stock is convertible into a share of Class A Non-Voting Common Stock, the shares of Class B Voting Common Stock held by Mr. Cohen are treated as the equivalent number of shares of Class A Non-Voting Common Stock for purposes of applying the stock ownership requirements.\nAll directors and executive officers are currently in compliance with the stock ownership requirements.\nOther Executive Compensation Matters\nChange in Control Severance Plan - The executive officers (other than Mr. Cohen) are participants in the EZCORP, Inc. Change in Control Severance Plan (the CIC Severance Plan), which was approved and adopted by the Board of Directors in November 2022. A participant in the CIC Severance Plan is entitled to receive certain severance benefits if both of the following events occur (a double trigger): The Company experiences a change in control and the executives employment is terminated within two years thereafter. The severance benefits include a cash payment equal to (1) a multiple of the participants annual base salary and target STI bonus plus (2) the participants prorated target bonus for the year in which the termination occurs. In addition, the Company will provide continued healthcare benefits for a number of years equal to the applicable multiple. The multiple referred to varies by executive officer, with the CEO, COO and CFO having multiples of 2.0 and the remaining executive officer participants having multiples of 1.5.\nThe Board of Directors has also approved amendments to the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan and all outstanding LTI awards to provide for the acceleration of vesting (at target levels, in the case of performance-based awards) upon the occurrence of a qualifying termination following a change in control. This acceleration of vesting benefit applies to the CIC Severance Plan participants, as well as all other holders of outstanding LTI awards.\nGenerally, for purposes of the CIC Severance Plan, a change in control will be deemed to have occurred if a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 50% or more of the combined voting power of the outstanding Company securities, either directly or through consummation of a business combination; provided, however, that any acquisition or beneficial ownership of voting securities by, or a transfer of voting securities to, Mr. Cohen, any of his heirs or any entity that is owned or controlled by Mr. Cohen or any of his heirs, shall not constitute a change in control.\nThe foregoing is just a summary description of the principal terms of the CIC Severance Plan and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full terms and provisions set forth in the plan document, which is filed as an exhibit to this Report.\nOther severance benefits - We provide the following other severance benefits to our executive officers (other than Mr. Cohen):\nUnless severance benefits under the CIC Severance Plan are triggered, each of our executive officers will receive one years base salary (as a lump sum or in the form of salary continuation) if their employment is terminated by the Company without cause.\nGenerally, restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards, including those granted to the executive officers, provide for accelerated vesting of some or all of the unvested shares or units in the event of the holder's death or disability.\nMore information on severance arrangements can be found under Other Benefit Plans - Certain Termination Benefits below. The Committee believes that these benefits provide important protection to the executive officers, are consistent with practice of the peer companies and are appropriate for attraction and retention of executive talent.\nRestrictive Covenant Agreements - Each of our executive officers (other than Mr. Cohen), along with other key Team Members, has entered into a Restrictive Covenant Agreement under which the executive is subject to confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations with respect to various categories of proprietary, competitively sensitive and confidential information. In addition, each such executive has agreed that, for a period of one year following the termination of employment with the Company, they will not compete with the Company (within a defined area) and will not solicit the Company's Team Members or suppliers.\nEmployment Contract for Mr. Given - On November 14, 2023, we entered into an Employment Contract with Mr. Given, our Chief Executive Officer, who resides in London, England. The Employment Contract was entered into to comply with U.K. employment laws and is not intended to alter the fundamental elements of Mr. Givens employment relationship, including the compensatory arrangement as reflected in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis. The terms of the Employment Contract mirror as close as possible the terms of Mr. Givens pre-existing U.S. employment, although certain modifications were necessary to adapt to a U.K. employment environment, particularly with regards to healthcare and other benefits. All compensation received by Mr. Given under the Employment Contract is reflected in the Summary Compensation Table below, including the All Other Compensation column, which includes healthcare and other benefits.\nCompensation Committee Report\nThe Compensation Committee has reviewed the foregoing Compensation Discussion and Analysis and has discussed it with management. Based on that review and those discussions, the Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.\nPablo Lagos Espinosa, Chair\nMatthew W.

See Note 10: Common Stock and Stock Compensation of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplemental Data. The actual value realized by the Named Executive Officer with respect to stock awards will depend on whether the award vests and, if it vests, the market value of our stock on the date the stock is sold.\nFor a description of these awards, see the Grant of Plan-Based Awards table under Incentive Plan Based Awards below. See also Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Components of Compensation and Fiscal 2023 Executive Compensation Actions - Long-Term Incentives above.\n(2)For Named Executive Officers other than Mr. Cohen, amounts represent the incentive bonuses paid pursuant to the Short-Term Incentive Compensation Plan. See Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Components of Compensation and Fiscal 2023 Executive Compensation Actions - Annual Incentive Bonuses above. For Mr. Cohen, amounts represent the incentive bonuses paid pursuant to the special incentive compensation arrangement described under Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Components of Compensation and Fiscal 2023 Executive Compensation Actions - Executive Chairman Incentive Award.\n(3)Amounts include the cost of providing various perquisites and personal benefits, as well as the value of our contributions to the company-sponsored 401(k) plan and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. For detail of the amounts shown for each Named Executive Officer, see the table under Other Benefits and Perquisites - All Other Compensation below.\n(4)Mr. Given and Mr. Jugmans serve on the board of directors of Cash Converters International Limited, with Mr. Jugmans serving as non-executive chairman. The director fees paid to each of them during fiscal 2023 by Cash Converters International Limited were as follows: Mr. Given, AUD $95,000; and Mr. Jugmans, AUD $170,000. These amounts are not included in the Summary Compensation Table, as they were paid by Cash Converters International Limited, which is not controlled by EZCORP.\nCEO Pay Ratio\nThe following information sets forth our calculation of the ratio between the annual total compensation of Lachlan P. Given, our Chief Executive Officer, and the annual total compensation of our median Team Member (CEO Pay Ratio).\nMr. Givens total annual compensation for fiscal 2023 was $4,481,280. That number is derived from the numbers set forth in the Summary Compensation Table above.\nOur median Team Members total annual compensation for fiscal 2023 was $18,208, consisting of gross annual wages, bonuses, overtime pay and other benefits.\nBased on those numbers, our CEO Pay ratio for fiscal 2023 is 246:1.\nOur CEO Pay Ratio is based on the following methodology:\nWhen we identified our median Team Member, we selected gross wages paid during fiscal year 2023 as the most appropriate measure of compensation and applied that measure consistently across our global population. Gross wages generally include salary and wages (regular, hourly and overtime), commissions and bonuses. We annualized the compensation of all permanent full-time and part-time Team Members as of September 30, 2023.\nWe calculated the median Team Members total annual compensation in accordance with the rules used to calculate the CEOs compensation included in the Summary Compensation Table above.\nUsing this methodology, we determined that our median Team Member was a full-time certified store manager located in Mexico where Team Member wages and cost of living are significantly lower than the U.S.\nIn calculating CEO pay ratios, companies are permitted to adopt a variety of methodologies, apply certain exclusions and make reasonable estimates and assumptions reflecting their unique employee populations. Therefore, our CEO Pay Ratio, as described above, may not be comparable to CEO pay ratios reported by other companies due to differences in industries and geographical dispersion of employees, as well as the different estimates, assumptions and methodologies applied by other companies in calculating their CEO pay ratios.\nIncentive Plan Based Awards\nThe following table sets forth certain information about plan-based awards that we made to the Named Executive Officers during fiscal 2023. For information about the plans under which these awards were granted, see Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Components of Compensation and Fiscal 2023 Compensation Actions - Annual Incentive Bonus and Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Components of Compensation and Fiscal 2023 Executive Compensation Actions - Long-Term Incentives above.\nGrants of Plan-Based Awards\nEstimated Future Payouts Under\nNon-Equity Incentive Plan Awards (1) Estimated Future Payouts Under\nEquity Incentive Plan Awards (2)\nName Grant Date Threshold Target Maximum Threshold Target Maximum Grant Date\nFair Value\nLachlan P.

See Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Components of Compensation and Fiscal 2023 Executive Compensation Actions - Annual Incentive Bonuses above. The Target amount is the amount that would be paid if the specified performance goals are achieved at the target level (although the People and Compensation Committee may reduce any award if it chooses to do so). The Threshold reflects the amount that would be paid if the minimum performance goals are achieved, while the Maximum amount represents the maximum amount that would be paid if the maximum performance goals are achieved or exceeded. See the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column in the Summary Compensation Table above for the amount of the actual payout for each of the Named Executive Officers.\n(2)The amounts shown represent long-term incentive (LTI) awards (stated in number of units) under our Long-Term Incentive Plans. See Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Components of Compensation and Fiscal 2023 Executive Compensation Actions - Long-Term Incentives.\n(3)Represents the estimated grant date fair value of equity awards, assuming payout at Target level. This is the estimated amount of aggregate compensation cost we expect to recognize over the performance period, determined as of the grant date. Because of the structure of the fiscal 2023 awards (as described under Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Components of Compensation and Fiscal 2023 Executive Compensation Actions - Long-Term Incentives - Fiscal 2023 Actions - Grant of Fiscal 2023 Awards above), each annual tranche of the awards is treated as a separate award for accounting purposes. Consequently, the amount shown represents the grant date fair value of the first annual tranche (20% of the award) plus the grant date fair value of the cumulative three-year performance tranche (20% of the award) plus the grant date fair value of the time-based tranche (20% of the award). The grant date fair value of the second and third annual tranches will be reflected in future years when the performance conditions for those tranches are established and they are deemed to be granted for accounting purposes.\n(4)Represents the grant date fair value of the bonus units awarded with respect to the second tranche of the fiscal 2021 LTI awards based on Adjusted Net Income performance during fiscal 2022, as discussed in our 2022 Annual Report under Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Components of Compensation and Fiscal 2022 Executive Compensation Actions - Long-Term Incentives - Fiscal 2022 Actions - Second Year Performance of Fiscal 2021 LTI Awards.\n(5)Represents the grant date fair value of the bonus units awarded with respect to the first tranche of the fiscal 2022 LTI awards based on Adjusted Net Income performance during fiscal 2022, as discussed in our 2022 Annual Report under Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Components of Compensation and Fiscal 2022 Executive Compensation Actions - Long-Term Incentives - Fiscal 2022 Actions - First Year Performance of Fiscal 2022 LTI Awards.\n(6)Represents the aggregate grant date fair value of the third tranche of the fiscal 2021 LTI awards and the second tranche of the fiscal 2022 LTI awards. Because of the structure of those awards, these tranches were treated as separate awards for accounting purposes granted at the beginning of fiscal 2023, even though the full number of units associated with the awards was included in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards table in the 2021 Annual Report and the 2022 Annual Report, respectively.\nThe following table sets forth certain information about outstanding stock awards held by the Named Executive Officers as of the end of fiscal 2023.

See Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Components of Compensation and Fiscal 2023 Executive Compensation Actions - Long-Term Incentives above.\nStock Vested\nThe following table sets forth, with respect to each of the Named Executive Officers, certain information about restricted stock that vested during fiscal 2023:\nStock Awards\nNamed Executive Officer Number of Shares\nAcquired on Vesting (1) Value Realized\non Vesting (2)\nLachlan P.

Subject to statutory limits of the IRS, this plan allows participants to have pre-tax amounts withheld from their pay and provides for a discretionary employer matching contribution (historically, 25% up to 6% of salary). Matching contributions are made in the form of cash. Participants may invest their contributions in various fund options, but are prohibited from investing their contributions in our common stock. A participant vests in the matching contributions over the first three years of service, provided the hours worked requirement is met. A participants matching contributions vest 100% in the event of death, disability or termination of the plan due to a change in control.\nSupplemental Executive Retirement Plan - We provide U.S. executive officers with a non-qualified Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) to offer a competitive benefit and to assist in offsetting potential impacts of contribution limitations applicable to our 401(k) retirement savings plan. The SERP has similar investment options as are available under the 401(k) retirement savings plan. Company contributions to the SERP are formula-based, reviewed and approved by the People and Compensation Committee each year. For fiscal 2023, our annual contributions to the SERP were calculated as 10% of base salary. For fiscal 2024, the Company contributions to the SERP will continue at the same rates for executive officers. Under the terms of the SERP, participants are also allowed to voluntarily defer all or a portion of their salary and bonus payments into the SERP. There were eight participants during fiscal 2023.\nAll Company contributed SERP funds have a vesting schedule as an additional retention tool. Generally, the funds vest over three years from the contribution date, with one-third vesting each year. All of a participants Company contributed SERP funds vest 100% in the event of the participants death or disability or the termination of the plan due to a change in control. In addition, all Company contributed SERP funds are 100% vested when a participant attains age 50 and five years of active service. All Company contributed SERP funds are forfeited, regardless of vesting status, if the participants employment is terminated for cause.\nA participant may not withdraw any portion of his or her SERP account while still employed by the Company unless, in the sole opinion of management, the participant has an unforeseeable emergency, which is defined as a severe financial hardship resulting from an illness or accident of the participant, the participants spouse or a dependent; the loss of the participants property due to casualty; or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstance arising as a result of events beyond the participants control.\nThe following table describes the SERP contributions, earnings and balance at the end of fiscal 2023 for each of the Named Executive Officers:\nNonqualified Deferred Compensation\nNamed Executive Officer Company Contributions in Fiscal 2023 (1)\nAggregate Earnings in Fiscal 2023 (2)\nAggregate Withdrawals/Distributions in Fiscal 2023\nAggregate Forfeitures in Fiscal 2023\nAggregate Balance at September 30, 2023 (3)\nLachlan P.

The amounts shown (other than the fiscal 2023 amount for Mr. Given) represent the total premiums paid for the supplemental executive medical plan for each of the Named Executive Officers during each of the years presented. The fiscal 2023 amount for Mr. Given represents the amount we reimburse Mr. Given for a supplemental health policy in the U.K. that, along with his U.K. National Health Service coverage, provides Mr. Given with healthcare benefits that are comparable to the benefits provided to the other executive officers.\n(2)Represents group life insurance premiums paid on behalf of the Named Executive Officers. The benefit provides life and accidental death and dismemberment coverage for the Named Executive Officers at three times annual salary up to a maximum of $1 million. The fiscal 2023 amount for Mr. Given represents the amount we paid for a rider to to the group term policy to provide Mr. Given with comparable benefits in the U.K.\n(3)Includes Company contributions to the 401(k) plan and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan.\nCertain Termination and Change-in-Control Benefits - The following is a summary of various agreements that provide for benefits to the continuing Named Executive Officers upon termination of employment or a change-in-control:\nRestricted Stock Award Agreements - The standard restricted stock award agreement pursuant to which we grant restricted stock or restricted stock units to our Team Members generally provides that vesting is accelerated in the event of the holders death or disability.\nSERP Contributions - For all executives who participate in the SERP (including the Named Executive Officers), any unvested Company contributions to the SERP will vest in the case of death or disability of the participant or a change in control.\nGeneral Severance Benefits - We currently provide each of our executive officers (other than Mr. Cohen) with one-year salary continuation if his or her employment is terminated by the Company without cause. This severance benefit is reflected in the terms of Mr. Givens U.K. Employment Contract. See Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Other Executive Compensation Matters - Employment Contract for Mr. Given.\nChange in Control Severance Benefits - The executive officers (other than Mr. Cohen) are subject to the Change in Control Severance Plan, which provides them with certain severance benefits in the form cash payments and continued healthcare benefits in the event that their employment is terminated in connection with or within two years following a change in control of the Company. See Compensation discussion and Analysis - Other Executive Compensation Matters - Change in Control Severance Plan. In addition, all outstanding LTI awards provide for the acceleration of vesting (at target levels, in the case of performance-based awards) upon the occurrence of a qualifying termination following a change in control.\nThe following table sets forth the amounts of severance or termination benefits that would have been payable to each of the Named Executive Officers upon the occurrence of various events, assuming each of the events occurred on September 30, 2023:\nSalary Incentive\nBonus Accelerated Vesting of\nRestricted\nStock (1) Accelerated Vesting of\nSERP\nBalance\nResignation for Good Reason:\nLachlan P.

See Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Other Executive Compensation Matters - Change in Control Severance Plan.\nDirector Compensation\nEach non-employee director receives a basic annual retainer fee, with the Lead Independent Director, the chair of the Audit Committee and the chair of the People and Compensation Committee each receiving an additional amount. During fiscal 2023 the basic annual retainer fee was $80,000, and additional amounts paid to the Lead Independent Director, the chair of the Audit Committee and the chair of the People and Compensation Committee were $40,000, $27,500 and $15,000, respectively. Annual retainer fees are paid in cash on a quarterly basis.\nThe non-employee directors are also eligible for stock option and restricted stock awards. The number of options or shares of restricted stock awarded, as well as the other terms and conditions of the awards (such as vesting and exercisability schedules and termination provisions), are determined by the Board of Directors upon the recommendation of the People and Compensation Committee. Historically, the directors have each received an annual restricted stock award with a grant date value equal to 2X the annual retainer fee. The annual award cycle is based on our Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which is generally held in February or March of each year, with the awards being granted on the date of the Annual Meeting of Stockholders and vesting on the day immediately preceding the date of the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held in the following year (but no later than March 31).\nThe following table sets forth the compensation paid to our non-employee directors for fiscal 2023. Mr. Cohen and Mr. Given are executive officers of the Company and do not receive any additional compensation for serving on the Board of Directors.\nDirector Fees Earned or Paid in Cash Restricted Stock Awards (1) Total\nMatthew W. Appel $ 120,000 $ 160,000 $ 280,000\nZena Srivatsa Arnold $ 80,000 $ 160,000 $ 240,000\nJason A. Kulas $ 80,000 $ 160,000 $ 240,000\nPablo Lagos Espinosa $ 95,000 $ 160,000 $ 255,000\nGary L. Tillett $ 107,500 $ 160,000 $ 267,500\n(1)Amounts represent the aggregate grant date fair value of restricted stock awards, computed in accordance with FASB ASC 718-10-25. See Note 10: Common Stock and Stock Compensation of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplemental Data. The actual value realized by the director with respect to stock awards will depend on the market value of our stock on the date the stock is sold.\nEach of the non-employee directors received a grant of 18,038 shares of restricted stock on March 3, 2023. That amount was determined by dividing $160,000 (2X the annual director fee) by $8.87, the trading price of the Class A Common Stock at the time of grant. These shares are scheduled to vest immediately before the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (but no later than March 31, 2024).\nAs of September 30, 2023, each of the continuing non-employee directors held 18,038 shares of unvested restricted stock.\nThe non-employee director compensation program for fiscal 2024 will generally be the same as the fiscal 2023 program described above. ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS\nEquity Compensation Plans\nWe have two equity compensation plans that have been approved by stockholders - the 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan (applicable to outstanding long-term incentive awards issued on or before December 31, 2021) and the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan (applicable to all new issuance of since January 1. 2022). New awards can be in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock bonuses, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units or performance shares although generally we issue only restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards. We do not have any equity compensation plans that were not approved by stockholders. The following table summarizes information about our equity compensation plans as of September 30, 2023:\nPlan Category Number of Securities to\nbe Issued Upon Exercise\nof Outstanding Options\n(a) Weighted Average\nExercise Price of\nOutstanding Options\n(b) Number of Securities\nRemaining Available for\nFuture Issuance Under\nEquity Compensation\nPlans (Excluding\nSecurities Reflected in\nColumn (a))\n(c)\nEquity compensation plans approved by security holders - - 475,196 (1)\nEquity compensation plans not approved by security holders - - -\nTotal - - 475,196 (1)\n(1) Amount represents the number of shares available for issuance in the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan as of September 30, 2023. An additional 1.4 million shares were added to the plan on November 3, 2023 to cover the fiscal 2024 LTI awards to be issued in November 2023 which will leave 481,133 share for future issuances. The 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan remains effective only to cover currently outstanding awards issued on or prior to December 31, 2021, as that plan was replaced by the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan.\nStock Ownership\nPhillip E. Cohen controls EZCORP through his ownership of all of the issued and outstanding stock of MS Pawn Corporation, the sole general partner of MS Pawn Limited Partnership, which owns 100% of our Class B Voting Common Stock.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE\nRelated Party Transactions\nReview and Approval of Transactions with Related Persons\nThe Board of Directors has adopted a written comprehensive policy for the review and evaluation of all related party transactions. Under that policy, the Audit Committee is charged with the responsibility of (a) reviewing and evaluating all transactions, or proposed transactions, between the Company and a related person and (b) approving, ratifying, rescinding or taking other action with respect to each such transaction. With respect to any specific transaction, the Audit Committee may, in its discretion, transfer its responsibilities to either the full Board of Directors or to any special committee of the Board of Directors designated and created for the purpose of reviewing, evaluating, approving or ratifying such transaction.\nEmployment arrangement with Nicholas Cohen\nNicholas Cohen, the son of Phillip E. Cohen, the beneficial owner of all of our Class B Voting Common Stock and our Executive Chairman, has been an employee of the Company since May 2018, currently serving in the position of Vice President, Business Development. The Company considers the employment relationship with Nicholas Cohen to be a related party transaction that is subject to the Companys Policy for Review and Evaluation of Related Party Transactions. Accordingly, the Audit Committee reviews and approves all promotion opportunities and compensation changes for Nicholas Cohen.\nDirector Independence\nThe Board of Directors believes that the interests of the stockholders are best served by having a substantial number of objective, independent representatives on the Board. For this purpose, a director is considered to be independent if the Board determines that the director does not have any direct or indirect material relationship with the Company that may impair, or appear to impair, the directors ability to make independent judgments.\nThe Board has evaluated all relationships between the Company and each of the persons who served as a director during any portion of fiscal 2023 and has made the following determinations with respect to each directors independence:\nDirector Status (a)\nMatthew W. Appel Independent\nZena Srivatsa Arnold Independent\nPhillip E. Cohen Not independent (b)\nLachlan P. Given Not independent (b)\nJason A. Kulas Not independent (b)\nPablo Lagos Espinosa Independent\nGary L. Tillett Independent\n(a)The Boards determination that a director is independent was made on the basis of the standards for independence set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rules. Under those standards, a person generally will not be considered independent if he or she has a relationship that, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The Nasdaq rules also describe specific relationships that will prevent a person from being considered independent.\n(b)Mr. Cohen and Mr. Given were executive officers of the Company during all of fiscal 2023, and Mr. Kulas was an executive officer of the Company from February 2020 until January 2022. Therefore, they are not independent in accordance with the standards set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rules. ITEM 14.
