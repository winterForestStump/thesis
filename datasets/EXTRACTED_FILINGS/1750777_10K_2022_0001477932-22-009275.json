    "content": "Item 1. Description of Business\nGeneral\nWe were incorporated on May 15, 2018 in the State of Nevada. We are a technology holding company, our previous focus was on pandemic management products and services. We are currently seeking other opportunities, while actively trying to liquidate mask inventory and wind-up existing deals. The Company looks to license and acquire technology that improves life and to work with partners to develop cutting edge, smart products for a variety of markets. From inception until the date of this filing our activities have primarily consisted of (i) the incorporation of our company, (ii) the development of our business plan and the evaluation of strategic investment and business development strategies, (iii), recruiting and adding additional consultants and employees, and (iv) liquidating our stock of personal protective equipment (PPE) products through numerous sources.\nOur business office is located at 6605 Abercorn, Suite 204, Savannah, GA 31405. Our telephone number is 912-388-6720 and our website is www.hawkeyesystemsinc.com.\nBusiness Description\nIn July 2021, the Companys management determined to cease the Companys operations as a seller of PPE, deeming that continuing operations in that sector was not a productive use of the Companys resources.\nOur current business plan is to serve as a vehicle for the acquisition of or merger or consolidation with another company (a target business). We intend to use capital stock, debt or a combination of these to effect a business combination with a target business which we believe has significant growth potential. The business combination may be with a financially stable, mature company or a company that is in its early stages of development or growth, which could include companies seeking to obtain capital and to improve their financial stability.\nWe will not restrict our search for target businesses to any particular industry. Rather, we may investigate businesses of essentially any kind or nature and participate in any type of industry that may, in our managements opinion, meet our business objectives as described in this annual report. We emphasize that the description in this report of our business objectives is extremely general and is not meant to restrict the discretion of our management to search for and enter potential business opportunities. We have not chosen the industry or business in which we will engage and have not conducted any market studies with respect to any business or industry for you to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business or the industry in which we may ultimately operate. To the extent we enter into a business combination with a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stage of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings, we will become subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, to the extent that we effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, we will become subject to the currently unascertainable risks of that industry. An extremely high level of risk frequently characterizes certain industries that experience rapid growth. In addition, although we will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular industry or target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.\nSources of target businesses\nWe anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including securities broker-dealers, investment bankers, venture capitalists, bankers, and other members of the financial community, who may present solicited or unsolicited proposals. Our officers and directors and their affiliates may also bring to our attention target business candidates. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage such firms in the future, in which event, we may pay a finders fee or other compensation for such introductions if they result in consummated transactions. These fees are customarily between 5% and 25% of the size of the overall transaction, based upon a sliding scale of the amount involved and a variety of other factors.\nSelection of a target business and structuring of a business combination\nOur management will have significant flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business. In evaluating a prospective target business, our management will consider, among other factors, the following:\n\u00b7\nthe financial condition and results of operation of the target;\n\u00b7\nthe growth potential of the target and that of the industry in which the target operates;\n\u00b7\nthe experience and skill of the targets management and availability of additional personnel;\n\u00b7\nthe capital requirements of the target;\n\u00b7\nthe competitive position of the target;\n\u00b7\nthe stage of development that the targets products, processes, or services are at;\n\u00b7\nthe degree of current or potential market acceptance of the targets products, processes, or services;\n\u00b7\nproprietary features and the degree of intellectual property or other protection of the targets products, processes, or services\n\u00b7\nthe regulatory environment of the industry in which the target operates;\n\u00b7\nthe prospective equity interest in, and opportunity for control of, the target; and\n\u00b7\nthe costs associated with effecting the business combination.\nThese criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in connection with effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective. In connection with our evaluation of a prospective target business, we anticipate that we will conduct an extensive due diligence review that will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial or other information that will be made available to us.\nWe will endeavor to structure a business combination to achieve the most favorable tax treatment to us, the target business and both companies stockholders. We cannot assure you, however, that the Internal Revenue Service or appropriate state tax authority will agree with our tax treatment of the business combination.\nUntil we are presented with a specific opportunity for a business combination, we are unable to ascertain with any degree of certainty the time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the business combination. We have two full-time employees devoting their time to our affairs. Any costs incurred in connection with the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital otherwise available to complete a business combination.\nLimited ability to evaluate the target business management\nAlthough we intend to scrutinize the management of a prospective target business before effecting a business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of the targets management will prove to be correct, especially considering the possible inexperience of our officers and directors in evaluating certain types of businesses. In addition, we cannot assure you that the targets future management will have the necessary skills, qualifications, or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our officers and directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following a business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs after a business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that our officers and directors will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the target business.\nWe may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to recruit additional managers who have the requisite skills, knowledge, or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.\nInvestment Company Act\nThe Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Company Act) defines an investment company as any issuer which is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities. We may participate in a business or opportunity by purchasing, trading, or selling the securities of a business. However, as we do not intend to engage primarily in these activities, we believe that we do not fall under the Investment Company Acts definition of investment company, and we do not intend to register the Company as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We do not believe that registration under the Investment Company Act is required based upon our proposed activities. We intend to conduct our activities so as to avoid being classified as an investment company and avoid application of the costly and restrictive registration and other provisions of the Investment Company Act and its regulations.\nThe Investment Company Act may, however, also be deemed to be applicable to a company that does not intend to be characterized as an investment company but that, nevertheless, engages in activities that may be deemed to be within the definition and scope of certain provisions of the Investment Company Act. While we do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to regulation under the Investment Company Act, we cannot assure you that we will not be deemed to be an investment company, especially during the period prior to a business combination. In the event we are deemed to be an investment company, we may become subject to certain restrictions relating to our activities and regulatory burdens, including:\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the nature of our investments; and\n\u00b7\nthe issuance of securities,\nand have imposed upon us certain requirements, including:\n\u00b7\nregistration as an investment company;\n\u00b7\nadoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and\n\u00b7\ncompliance with certain burdensome reporting, recordkeeping, voting, proxy and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations.\nIn the event we are characterized as an investment company, we would be required to comply with these additional regulatory burdens, which would require additional expense.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company currently does not own any intellectual property, and directly acquiring the intellectual property of a third party is not part of our current strategy.\nRegulation\nIn our current business we are subject to local, state, federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations. Upon completion of an acquisition, we will have significant additional regulation based on the nature of the business.\nInvestment in HIE LLC\nOn July 17, 2020, the Company entered into a membership agreement with Eagle Equities LLC (Eagle) and Ikon Supplies (Ikon) for the purpose of procuring, funding the purchase of and sale of PPE (the Membership Agreement). To pursue this objective, the parties agreed to form a Nevada limited liability company, HIE, LLC (HIE). According to the terms and conditions of the Membership Agreement, HIE would be terminated and dissolved upon the earliest to occur of: (i) the sale of HIEs interest in the procurement, financing, transportation, sale and disposition of PPE; (ii) the refusal or inability of any party to comply with the requirements, obligations or stipulations of the Membership Agreement; (iii) the unanimous agreement of the parties; or (iv) the order of a court of competent jurisdiction. Eagle, Ikon and the Company would participate each in 33% of any net profits generated by HIE. Eagle contributed to HIE by providing and arranging to procure a loan (the Origination Loan), sufficient to cover all capital needed for each PPE purchase (a Deal); and additional funds, as needed, to cover additional expenses towards the costs of goods (Additional Contribution). The Company contributed by assigning its agreement to purchase gloves and agreed to issue convertible promissory notes to Eagle to secure the Origination Loan and any Additional Contribution. The parties agreed to pay an equal portion of all administrative expenses incurred by HIE. In the event of a loss of capital, all parties shall contribute to repay the Origination Loan and Additional Contribution with each paying 33.3% of the loss.\nThe proceeds of each Deal shall be first distributed to Eagle, as repayment for any Additional Contribution. The next proceeds will be allocated to the repayment of the Origination Loan. After the Origination Loan is repaid, net proceeds will be distributed as follows: (i) Eagle shall receive the greater of $0.25 per box of gloves or 33.3% of the net proceeds. If net proceeds are more than $0.25, but less than $0.75 per box, once the first $0.25 is paid to Eagle, the Company and Ikon will share in the remaining profits equally. If the net profits are more than $0.75 per box, all the parties will receive 33.3% of the net profits. Net losses shall be allocated between the parties which each being allocated 33.3%.\nHIE will be managed by a manager appointed by the parties in accordance with a policy established by the policy committee. Each of the Company and Ikon will have 25 votes in the policy committee and Eagle will have 50 votes.\nIn October 2022, HIE provided the Company with its financial statements. HIE incurred a net gain of $59,208 between July 01, 2021 and June 30, 2022, and a net loss of 1,385,962 between July 01, 2020 to June 30, 2021, of which the Company has recorded a gain on investment of $19,736, and a loss on investment of $461,987, in fiscal year end of June 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nCompany Policies\nThe Company has adopted the following policies: (i) code of conduct policy; (ii) information security policy; and (iii) public company communication policy.\nEmployees\nThe Company currently has two full time employees.\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is not currently a party to any material legal proceedings and is not aware of any material threatened litigation.\nOffices\nOur current executive offices are provided by management of the Company. We do not pay any rent, and there is no agreement to pay any rent in the future. Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. Item 2. Properties.\nWe own no properties related to our operations. We operate from business offices provided by our executive officers. Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nOn September 19, 2019, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Radiant Images, Inc., a California corporation (Radiant), as well as Radiants shareholder Gianna Wolfe (Wolfe) and key employee, Michael Mansouri (Mansouri), pursuant to which the Company would acquire 100% of the shares of common stock (the Shares) of Radiant from Wolfe, resulting in the acquisition of Radiant. In April 2020, the Company received notice from Radiant of their intent to terminate the Companys acquisition agreement. Although the Company believes that the termination is not legally valid, the Company ceased further discussions with respect to the acquisition and engaged counsel to pursue litigation for repayment of amounts due by Radiant. The Companys investment in Radiant was structured as a revolving note has been classified as a Note Receivable from Radiant due with accrued but unpaid interest. Pursuant to the terms of the revolving note, Radiant is required to repay the money already invested to Hawkeye with interest. The note receivable was issued on April 26, 2019, is due upon demand of the Company at any time commencing April 26, 2020. The interest rate on the note is 12% and accrues daily on the outstanding balance. At June 30, 2020 interest income of $154,042 had been accrued on the note. Under accounting treatment, this note and interest are impaired on our balance sheet while we resolve this dispute. We had filed a complaint against Radiant and its principals and intended to vigorously pursue this matter and litigation. The dispute was amicably resolved by the parties by means of a Settlement Agreement and Release of All Claims dated November 17, 2021, whereby the Company as plaintiff and cross-defendant released, and was in turned released, by Radiant, Gianna Wolfe and Michael Mansouri from any and all claims in connection with the stock purchase agreement and revolving note. No payment was due to or made by the Company in connection with the settlement and release of this action.\nOn November 13, 2019, 5W Public Relations LLC (5W) filed a complaint against Hawkeye Systems, Inc. relating to payments allegedly due under a contract for public relations services. Hawkeye vigorously disputed the allegations in the complaint as 5W Public Relations provided virtually no services to Hawkeye during the term of this arrangement but was paid a substantial amount of funds. Hawkeye engaged counsel to provide counterclaims for failure of consideration, fraud in the inducement, general fraud, and other causes of action. This proceeding was resolved by a Stipulation of Settlement dated May 19, 2022, filed with the Supreme Court of the State of New York. The Company settled all of 5Ws claims for the sum of $30,000.\nOther than the foregoing, we are not aware of any legal proceedings contemplated by any governmental authority or any other party involving us or our properties. As of the date of this report, no director, officer, or affiliate is (i) a party adverse to us in any legal proceeding, or (ii) has an adverse interest to us in any legal proceedings. We are not aware of any other legal proceedings pending or that have been threatened against us or our properties.\nFrom time to time the Company may be named in claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Currently, no legal proceedings or claims, other than those disclosed above, are pending against or involve the Company that, in the opinion of management, could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on its business and financial condition.

Item 6. Selected Financial Data.\nNot applicable. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion relates to the historical operations and financial statements of Hawkeye Systems, Inc. for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe following Managements Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report. The Managements Discussion and Analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Any statements that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. When used, the words believe, plan, intend, anticipate, target, estimate, expect, and the like, and/or future-tense or conditional constructions (will, may, could, should, etc.), or similar expressions, identify certain of these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements in this annual report. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences in results and outcomes include, without limitation, those specifically addressed under the heading \"Risks Factors\" in our various filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this annual report.\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue our operations.\nWe expect we will require additional capital to develop our business plan. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Years Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021\nthe Company had $0 operating revenues during fiscal year 2022 as the Company ceased operations of its PPE business since July 2021. In our fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, we had operating revenues of $2,556,942. Cost of sales was $2,576,875 resulting in gross loss of $19,933, or (0.8%). These revenues are from the sale of PPE products.\nTotal operating expenses in the year ended June 30, 2022 were $1,230,468 compared to $2,583,100 for the same period in 2021. The decrease in operating expenses is primarily a result of company downsizing. The Companys net loss was $1,288,802 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 compared to $5,203,820 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. The net loss for the fiscal year 2022 is primarily a result of operating expenses, and interest expense.\nDuring our fiscal year 2021, total operating expenses were $2,583,100 compared to $2,217,981 for the same period in 2020. The increase in operating expenses is primarily a result of increased write down of inventory. The Companys net loss was $5,203,820 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 compared to $2,600,468 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. The net loss for the fiscal 2021 is primarily a result of operating expenses, financing expense, loss on settlement of debt and, loss on investment in HIE.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur cash balance at June 30, 2022 was $325 compared to $282,131 at June 30, 2021. We do not believe these cash reserves are sufficient to cover our expenses for our operations for fiscal year ending June 30, 2022. We will require additional funding for our ongoing operations.\nDuring our fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, the Company issued common stock valued at $30,000 in connection with a settlement of accounts payable. In addition, the Company issued common stock valued $477,000 associated with stock payables settlements by related parties.\nAs of our fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, we raised approximately $20,000 from private offerings of our common stock and an additional $67,500 from exercise of warrants. We raised additional funds of $500,000, net from a related party, which is included in inventory financing payable and $250,000 from convertible notes related party.\nIn addition, we intend to raise funds through the sale of equity and the exercise of warrants issued in private placements. Although to date we have had some warrant exercises for cash, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise money through offerings or through the exercise of warrants. If we cannot raise any additional financing prior to the expiration of the first quarter of 2023, we believe we will be able to obtain loans from management in the future, if necessary, but have no agreement in writing.\nWe are a smaller reporting company and have accumulated losses to date. Under a limited operations scenario to maintain our corporate existence, we believe we will require additional funds over the next 12 months to complete our regulatory reporting and filings. However, we will require maximum participation through private placements, warrant exercises or alternative financings to implement our business plan.\nThere are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations. Even if additional financing is available, it may not be available on terms we find favorable. Failure to secure the needed additional financing will have an adverse effect on our ability to remain in business.\nPlan of Operation and Funding\nWe expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through equity offerings, warrant exercises, and related party advances in the near future. We have no guarantees or firm commitments that the related party advances will continue in the near future.\nExisting working capital, further advances, together with anticipated capital raises are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next twelve months, but there is no guarantee that we will be successful in raising enough capital, or that we will receive the cash flow required to fund our operations. We have no lines of credit with banking institutions or other bank financing arrangements, we do have a line a credit form a related party (see Note 7 to the Financial Statements). Generally, we have financed operations to date through proceeds from the sale of our common stock, warrant exercises and convertible loans.\nManagement anticipates additional increases in operating expenses relating to: (i) developmental expenses; and (ii) legal and accounting fees, required to complete our filings with the SEC. We intend to finance these expenses with issuances of securities and through the exercise of outstanding warrants.\nAdditional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to continue our operations.\nMaterial Commitments\nAs of the date of this annual report, we do not have any material commitments.\nPurchase of Significant Equipment\nWe do not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of the date of this annual report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.\nGoing Concern\nAs reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $10,882,176 at June 30, 2022 and net loss from operations of $1,288,802.\nThe Company does not yet have a history of financial stability. Historically, the principal source of liquidity has been the issuance of equity securities and related party advances. In addition, the Company is in the development stage and has accumulated losses since inception. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe ability of the Company to continue operations is dependent on the success of Managements plans and raising of capital through the issuance of equity securities, until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements.\nThe Company will require additional funding to finance its operations as well as to identify, negotiate and materialize a business combination with a target business. The Company believes its current available cash may be insufficient to meet its cash needs for the near future. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or terms acceptable to the Company, if at all.\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nFor a discussion of our accounting policies and related items, please see the Notes to the Financial Statements, included in Item 8.

(the \"Company\") as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the related statement of operations, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nRestatement of June 30, 2021 Financial Statements\nAs discussed in Note 4 to the financial statements, the financial statements have been restated to correct certain misstatements.\nSubstantial Doubt about the Companys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Companys significant operating losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ BF Borgers CPA PC\nBF Borgers CPA PC\nServed as Auditor since 2018\nLakewood, CO\nDecember 14, 2022\nHAWKEYE SYSTEMS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nJune 30,\nJune 30,\n2021 (Restated)\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash\n$ 325\n$ 282,131\nPrepaid expenses\n1,333\n3,000\nTotal current assets\n1,658\n285,131\nInvestment in HIE\n-\n245,667\nTotal assets\n$ 1,658\n$ 530,798\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY (DEFICIT)\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\n$ 273,592\n$ 133,088\nConvertible note payable, net of discount -

Organization\nHawkeye Systems, Inc. (the Company), a Nevada corporation incorporated in May 15, 2018, is a technology holding company until 2022 we focused on pandemic management products and services. We have decided to wind down our PPE business and we are currently looking for opportunities to license and/or acquire interests in a target business with significant growth potential. We will not restrict our search for target businesses to any particular industry. Rather, we may investigate businesses of essentially any kind or nature and participate in any type of industry that may, in our managements opinion, meet the business objectives determined by our management team.\nNote 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of presentation\nThe accompanying financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP).\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Companys estimates. Significant estimates in the accompanying financial statements include useful lives of property and equipment, fair value assumptions used for stock-based compensation, and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.\nCash\nThe Company considers cash in banks and other deposits with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash and cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents as of June 30, 2022 and 2021.\nFinancial instruments\nFor certain of the Companys financial instruments, including cash, and convertible note payable, related party, the carrying amounts approximate their fair values due to their short maturities.\nAccounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts\nTrade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Companys best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in its existing accounts receivable. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments for services or goods. Accounts with known financial issues are first reviewed and specific estimates are recorded. The remaining accounts receivable balances are then grouped in categories by the number of days the balance is past due, and the estimated loss is calculated as a percentage of the total category based upon past history. Account balances are charged against the allowance when it is probable that the receivable will not be recovered.\nThe Company had no balance on accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts at June 30, 2022 or 2021.\nInventory\nInventories, consisting of finished goods and goods in transit, are primarily accounted for using the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method of accounting. Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The Company estimates the net realizable value of inventories based on an assessment of expected sales prices.\nThe Company has no inventory as of June 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nFair value measurements\nWhen required to measure assets or liabilities at fair value, the Company uses a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used. The Company determines the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements in their entirety fall. The categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Level 1 uses quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, Level 2 uses significant other observable inputs, and Level 3 uses significant unobservable inputs. The amount of the total gains or losses for the period are included in earnings that are attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to those assets and liabilities still held at the reporting date. The Company has no assets or liabilities that are adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis.\nConvertible financial instruments\nThe Company bifurcates conversion options from their host instruments and accounts for them as free-standing derivative financial instruments if certain criteria are met. The criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not remeasured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur, and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. An exception to this rule is when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional, as that term is described under applicable U.S. GAAP.\nWhen the Company has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments, discounts are recorded for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in the instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the instrument.\nCommon stock purchase warrants and derivative financial instruments\nCommon stock purchase warrants and other derivative financial instruments are classified as equity if the contracts (1) require physical settlement or net-share settlement, or (2) give the Company a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in its own shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement). Contracts which (1) require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is outside the control of the Company), (2) give the counterparty a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement), or (3) that contain reset provisions that do not qualify for the scope exception; are classified as liabilities. The Company assesses classification of its common stock purchase warrants and other derivatives at each reporting date to determine whether a change in classification between equity and liabilities is required.\nBeneficial conversion feature\nThe issuance of the convertible debt generated a beneficial conversion feature (BCF), which arises when a debt or equity security is issued with an embedded conversion option that is beneficial to the investor or in the money at inception because the conversion option has an effective strike price that is less than the market price of the underlying stock at the commitment date. The Company recognized the BCF by allocating the intrinsic value of the conversion option, which is the number of shares of common stock available upon conversion multiplied by the difference between the effective conversion price per share and the fair value of common stock per share on the commitment date, resulting in a discount on the convertible debt (recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital). The discount is amortized to interest expense over the term of the convertible debt.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, the Company does not foresee generating taxable income in the near future and utilizing its deferred tax asset, therefore, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of, the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.\nA tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company has no material uncertain tax positions for any of the reporting periods presented.\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue is recorded in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Revenue is recognized from product sales when goods are shipped, title and risk of loss have transferred to the purchaser, there are no significant vendor obligations, the fees are fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in net sales. Costs associated with shipping and handling are included in cost of goods sold. The Company recognizes sales on a gross basis when it is considered the primary obligor in the transaction and on a net basis when it is considered to be acting as an agent. We record estimates for cash discounts, product returns, and other discounts in the period of the sale. This provision is recorded as a reduction from gross sales and the reserves are shown as a reduction of accounts receivable.\nCost of sales\nCost of sales includes inventory costs and shipping and freight expenses.\nRelated parties\nThe Company follows ASC 850, Related Party Disclosures, for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.\nCommitments and contingencies\nThe Company follows ASC 450-20, Loss Contingencies, to report accounting for contingencies. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated.\nBasic and diluted earnings per share\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus the effect of potentially dilutive common stock equivalents, including stock options, warrants to purchase the Company's common stock, and convertible note payable. For the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, potentially dilutive common stock equivalents not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive are as follows:\nJune 30,\nJune 30,\nWarrants\n2,493,996\n3,069,329\nOptions\n4,256,000\n7,280,000\nConvertible notes\n42,247,315\n2,000,000\nTotal possible dilutive shares\n48,997,311\n12,349,329\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation to employees and non-employees consist of stock options grants, warrants to purchase common stock, and restricted shares that are recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values at the date of grant. The fair value of share of common stock is based on the trading price of the Companys share.\nThe Company calculates the fair value of option and warrant grants utilizing the Black-Scholes pricing model. Assumptions used by the Company in using the Black-Scholes pricing model include:\n1)\nvolatility based on the Companys average volatility rate,\n2)\nrisk free interest rate based on the U.S. Treasury yield for a term consistent with the expected life of the awards in effect at the time of the grant,\n3)\nthe expected life of the option or warrants, and\n4)\nexpected cash dividend rate on shares of common stock.\nDuring the year ending June 30, 2022, volatility was based on average rates for trading price of the Companys share, while at the year ending June 30, 2021, volatility was based on average rates for similar publicly traded companies.\nThe amount of stock-based compensation recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. The resulting stock-based compensation expense for employee awards is generally recognized on a straight- line basis over the vesting period of the award.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nManagement has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued and their potential effect on our financial statements.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, ASC Subtopic 470-20 Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options and ASC subtopic 815-40 Hedging-Contracts in Entitys Own Equity. The standard reduced the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Convertible instruments that continue to be subject to separation models are (1) those with embedded conversion features that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, that meet the definition of a derivative, and that do not qualify for a scope exception from derivative accounting; and (2) convertible debt instruments issued with substantial premiums for which the premiums are recorded as paid-in capital. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years.\nThe Company early adopted this standard effective July 1, 2021 using the modified retrospective approach transition method. Therefore, the condensed financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2022 are presented under the new standard, while the comparative period presented is not adjusted and continues to be reported in accordance with the Companys historical accounting policy.\nNote 3 - Going Concern\nThe Companys financial statements are prepared using U.S. GAAP, applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company had a net loss of $1,288,802. As of June 30, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $10,882,176. The Company has not established sufficient revenue to cover its operating costs and will require additional capital to continue its operating plan. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.\nIn order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Managements plan to obtain such resources for the Company includes: sales of equity instruments; traditional financing, such as loans; and obtaining capital from management and significant stockholders sufficient to meet its minimum operating expenses. However, management cannot provide any assurance that the Company will be successful in accomplishing this plan.\nThere is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain sufficient additional funds when needed or that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company. In addition, profitability will ultimately depend upon the level of revenues received from business operations. However, there is no assurance that the Company will attain profitability. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.\nNote 4 - Restatement of Financial Statements for the Year End June 30, 2021\nOn July 17, 2020, the Company entered into a membership agreement with Eagle Equities LLC (Eagle) and Ikon Supplies (Ikon) to form a Nevada Limited Liability Company, HIE, LLC (HIE) for the purpose of procuring, funding the purchase of and sale of PPE (the Membership Agreement). Subject to the provision of the Agreement, the interest of any net profits shall be shares 33.3% among each member.

Change in and Disagreement with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In our review, we sought to find potential for material weaknesses in our financial controls, which is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in our accounting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, which include a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatement, whether unintentional errors or fraud. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.\nOur management, consisting of Corby Marshall as Chief Executive Officer and Christopher Mulgrew as Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(3) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) and financial reporting as of June 30, 2021. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria described in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), as well as the guidance provided in SEC Release 33-8809. In such evaluation, Mr. Marshall and Mr. Mulgrew assessed daily interaction, self-assessment and other on going monitoring activities as evidence in the evaluation. Furthermore we sought to identify financial reporting risks, identify controls that adequately address financial reporting risks, considered entity level controls, reviewed the role of technology in our controls and reviewed the evidence available to support the assessment.\nBased on this evaluation, our management concluded that, as of June 30, 2022, our disclosure controls and our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective in recording, processing, summarizing and report on a timely basis information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act and were not effective in assuring that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act due to material weaknesses including (i) the Company having only two officers handling all financial transactions, (ii) lack of appropriate operational controls and consistency in providing our accounting personnel with financial information, (iii) incomplete financial statements on a daily basis and resulting errors in our underlying accounting system, (iv) lack of proper documentation of our assessment and evaluation, and (v) our determination that internal controls were ineffective due to the limited segregation of duties because of the limited management structure.\nIn response to that assessment we have made a determination that all accounting and financial reporting services should be outsourced to a qualified consulting firm, and we immediately engaged a new financial services provider. We subsequently replaced that provider with an internal accounting contractor.\nWe have also made the determination that we need to dedicate more of the Companys current and future financial resources to this function and engaged a permanent Chief Financial Officer.\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permits us to provide only managements report in this annual report.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nOther than engaging a new financial services firm to provide financial statements, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of the year ended June 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
