    "content": "ITEM 1. Business\nNature of Operations and Going Concern\nAPPlife Digital Solutions, Inc. (the Company) was formed March 5, 2018, in Nevada and has offices in San Francisco, California and Shanghai, China. Our office in San Francisco, California allows us to take advantage of the marketing opportunities available in the United States as well as keeping close proximity to sources of capital whether it is debt or equity. Our offices in Shanghai, China allows us to take advantage of a high concentration of skilled tech coders and developers at lower capital costs than in more developed countries such as the United States or Europe. The Companys mission is using digital technology to create APPs and websites that make life, business and living easier, more efficient and just smarter.\nWe are a development stage company with a limited operating history, operations, and revenues and we will need to raise capital to implement our planned operations. If we are unable to do so, an entire investment in our stock could be lost.\nThe Company anticipates that it would need a minimum of approximately $1,500,000 over the next 12 months to continue as a going concern and bring the Companys apps to market and generate revenue within that time frame. Specifically, in order for the Company to fully implement its plans to create apps and spend the necessary marketing expenditures for them we will need: (1) $750,000 for marketing expenses, (2) $500,000 for general administration and overhead expenses, (3) $180,000 for legal and accounting expenses, and (3) $70,000 for developers and engineers and app and server maintenance expenses. If we are not able to raise enough funds, we may be forced to look for capital through debt or equity, which would dilute our common stockholders.\nProducts\nAs of the period from inception, through the todays date, we did not generate any revenue and incurred expenses and operating losses, as part of our developmental stage activities in developing three apps, B2BCHX, DRINX and ROOSTER. B2BCHX is our first fully developed app that is available in iTunes App Store and Google Play and a functioning ecommerce website. B2BCHX allows business owners around the world to order three levels of background checks on Chinese companies to prevent fraudulent business transactions. The retail price for each report is $79, $399 and $1,299.\nROOSTER ESSENTIALS ecommerce website, mobile website and app (iOS and Google Play) has been developed and launched BETA operations in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 and launched its full commercial operations in the second quarter of 2022. ROOSTER ESSENTIALS is an online mens grooming supply store, and it allows men to fully customize which products they receive and set up an auto-delivery schedule for each product for automatic recurring delivery. ROOSTER ESSENTIALS currently carries over 200 products from over 80 brands. We anticipate the sources of revenue will come from product purchases, advertising and sponsorships.\nOFFICE HOP entered beta testing in the fourth quarter of 2021 and is now fully functional and began commercial operations in January 2022. We believe OFFICE HOP fits perfectly into the needs of the post Covid working world, where short term offices and meeting rooms will be in high demand. The OFFICE HOP model is like Airbnb for short term shared or private office space and meeting rooms. Those offices that have an extra office, shared desk, an empty meeting room or conference room may list the space and act as a host for a user. Those users in need of a short-term shared desk, meeting room or private office may locate one on our platform and rent it out for use as needed by the hour, half day, full day, week or month. We will also offer access to creative spaces such as photo studios and pop-up art galleries and will offer restaurants with private rooms a way to rent out the space with a menu included for group or lunch meetings. The revenue is expected to come from the 10-15% service fee charged to Users for finding and making a transaction with one of our listed properties. The platform is global. We will begin operations in North America and Europe and then eventually operate in South America and Asia.\nGlobal Hemp Services LLC is a low risk and low cost participation in the fast growing Hemp and CBD market space. We have licensed out our fully functional ecommerce platform in exchange for a 15% equity position and 2.5%\nrevenue share, with exclusive rights to purchase an additional 36% of the equity (for a total of 51%) upon reaching revenue benchmarks. Global Hemp Services LLC distributes Hemp and CBD products globally, including Hemp based building materials, textiles, plastics, paper, personal care items and various CBD products. They will distribute wholesale to shops and stores and retail directly to consumers.\nLollipop NFT will be an online marketplace, consignment store, creator platform, and wallet for non-fungible tokens and is being developed for use by individuals of all levels, from beginners to experts. We have completed the design and preliminary development phase of this project. We expect to launch the platform in our second quarter of 2023. Users do not need have a superior technology background or a high-level understanding of non-fungible tokens (NFT) to enjoy and profit from creating and selling NFTs.\nOur DRINX project is in early stage of development, and we believe the beta version will be ready by the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. DRINX app allows anyone to purchase a virtual drink ticket anywhere and at any time for friends and colleagues. We anticipate the sources of revenue will come from advertising and sponsorships from alcohol companies promoting products on the app, user fee of $0.99 to send each drink and discounts provided by the bars and restaurants for purchases made by the app.\nCompetition\nAlthough there are countless app and website developers and companies out there, we believe we have advantages over competitors. First our dual location of offices. Our business, management and marketing based in the U.S and our development team is located in Shanghai. Our creative team works in both places. Access to talent at a much more reasonable cost in Shanghai allows flexibility and that allows creativity to be explored more freely and makes completing projects with new or unique features much more likely. We can also finish faster and for less money and then focus dollars on marketing and obtaining customers. Second, our planned access to investment capital and filing to trade as a public company will allow us to not only build and develop our own concepts and ideas like any other app development company, but we will also be able to explore opportunities to invest in and participate in the growth and development of other companies that are not our own in-house projects, which will hopefully give us the advantage of accelerated growth.\nMarketing Strategy\nOur marketing strategy is carefully built and tailored for each of our individual projects. Multiple projects in varying industries allows us to cast a wide net in attracting customers from different marketplaces globally.\nOur completed project B2BCHX will be marketed as an anti-fraud or fraud prevention service when doing business with a Chinese company. The Company believes that globally, clients of Chinese businesses have no way to verify information or do a background check in a cost-effective way. B2BCHX helps prevent fraud by providing customers with a background check in an inexpensive, easy to read, one-page report. They can use the information for confidence when sending money, to verify what they have been told by the company staff or to try to track down a company that has not fulfilled the obligations to the customer.\nThe variations on the types of businesses we can develop allows our product to be sold across multiple market spaces. We are not limited to a single market or model.\nThe strategic partnerships with each of our individual in house projects are invaluable. For our Drinx app, which we plan to launch its Alpha version in the fall of 2023, Beta by winter 2024, and commercial launch in Spring 2024, we have collaborated with a well-known, long term New York City restaurateur and club owner, Lesly Bernard. His knowledge and market experience will allow New York City to be our base city in the Drinx service and expand from there. Bernard will consult and advise on the development of the look and feel of the app and will participate in the launch of the app in each city. He will lead project management and will be active in the marketing of the service. In exchange for his time and efforts, Bernard has agreed in to take a minority equity position in the Drinx app. We are negotiating to bring in additional brand ambassadors and influencers including Natalia Bruschi.\nWe have also engaged an IR/PR team to help create marketing campaigns and create editorial content for each of our businesses as we launch. And soon OfficeHop and have paused the marketing campaign for B2BCHX to allow global\nfactory orders to re-establish themselves post pandemic. We are currently in a soft launch of Rooster using with a well-timed and placed marketing campaign and plan to re-ignite the B2BCHX model and launch OfficeHop this fall.\nEmployees\nWe currently have one full time employee who does have a formal employment agreement. We plan to hire additional employees as needed as the Company grows. We currently have engaged the services of several independent contractors to fill employee positions, including our chief financial officer, our investor relations director, our project manager, and our chief legal officer.
