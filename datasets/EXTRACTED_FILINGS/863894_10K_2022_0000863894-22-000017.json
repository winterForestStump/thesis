    "content": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\nVeru is a biopharmaceutical company with a drug development program for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients at high risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other viral-related ARDS and for the management of advanced breast and prostate cancers, as well as a sexual health program which includes two FDA-approved products, ENTADFI\u2122, for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and the FC2 Female Condom\u00ae (Internal Condom).\nOur infectious disease clinical development program includes:\nHospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients at high risk for ARDS\nSabizabulin, a microtubule disruptor.\nOur oncology clinical development program includes:\nAdvanced breast cancer\nEnobosarm, a selective androgen receptor targeting agonist\nSabizabulin, a microtubule disruptor\nAdvanced prostate cancer\nSabizabulin, a microtubule disruptor\nVERU-100, a long-acting GnRH antagonist depot\nZuclomiphene citrate, an oral nonsteroidal estrogen receptor agonist.\nOur two FDA-approved products within our sexual health program include:\nENTADFI\u2122 (tadalafil 5mg and finasteride 5mg capsule), for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)\nFC2 Female Condom\u00ae (Internal Condom) (FC2), for the dual protection against unplanned pregnancy and the transmission of sexually transmitted infections.\nCompany History\nVeru is a Wisconsin corporation that is the successor to The Wisconsin Pharmacal Company, Inc. (Wisconsin Pharmacal), a company which manufactured and marketed disparate specialty chemical and branded consumer products. Wisconsin Pharmacal was originally incorporated in 1971. In 1996, we completed a series of actions which resulted in our acquisition of worldwide rights to our first-generation female condom, the divestiture of Wisconsin Pharmacals other businesses and the change of our name to The Female Health Company. On October 31, 2016, we completed our acquisition of Aspen Park Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the APP Acquisition), which transitioned us from a single product company selling FC2 to a biopharmaceutical company with a robust drug development program. On July 31, 2017, we changed our corporate name from The Female Health Company to Veru Inc. reflecting our focus on developing and commercializing biopharmaceutical products.\nOur Strategy\nOur strategy focuses primarily on the clinical development and commercialization of novel medicines for COVID-19 and other viral ARDS-related diseases and novel oncology medicines, initially for the management of two of the most prevalent cancers globally - breast cancer and prostate cancer. In addition, we seek to operate and grow our sexual health program to help fund our oncology and other clinical development efforts. The key elements of our strategy are:\n\uf0b7Develop and launch high value, novel biopharmaceutical products for COVID-19 and other viral ARDS-related diseases.\nWe discovered that sabizabulin, an oral, first-in-class, new chemical entity, microtubule disruptor, which is being developed for cancer indications, also has both broad antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. We hypothesized that based on this mechanism of drug action, sabizabulin may serve as a two-pronged approach to the treatment of COVID-19 viral infection, and the subsequent debilitating inflammatory effects that can lead to ARDS and death. The Company has completed positive Phase 2 and positive Phase 3 clinical studies evaluating sabizabulin in hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients at high risk for ARDS and death. The Phase 3 clinical study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 COVID-19 clinical trial that was conducted in 204 hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients at high risk for ARDS and death. The primary endpoint was the proportion of deaths by Day 60. Based on a planned interim analysis of the first 150 patients randomized, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee unanimously halted the study for clear clinical efficacy and identified no safety concerns. Treatment with sabizabulin 9 mg once daily resulted in a clinically meaningful and statistically significant 55.2% relative reduction in deaths compared to placebo receiving standard of care treatment. On June 7, 2022, the Company submitted a request for FDA emergency use authorization for sabizabulin in adult hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients at high risk for ARDS and death.\nOn November 9, 2022, the FDAs Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee (PADAC) met to review sabizabulin for the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients who are at high risk for ARDS. The advisory committee voted 8-5 that the known and potential benefits of sabizabulin when used for the treatment of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at high risk of ARDS do not outweigh the known and potential risks of sabizabulin. However, there was additional discussion around the clinical trial design aspects of a potential confirmatory Phase 3 COVID-19 clinical trial as a post emergency use authorization requirement. The FDA considers the input of the advisory committee as part of their review of the EUA, but the advisory committee decision is not binding and the FDA makes the final decision on the request for an EUA.\nThe UKs Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) informed the Company on July 25, 2022, that the sabizabulin marketing authorization application will receive expedited review. On July 27, 2022, The European Medicines Agency (EMA)s Emergency Task Force initiated the review of sabizabulin treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 patients for emergency use in European Union (EU) countries under Article 18. On August 22, 2022, Australias Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) determined that sabizabulin treatment in hospitalized COVID-19 patients at high risk for ARDS qualifies for an expedited, provisional registration regulatory pathway.\nWe want to focus the clinical development of sabizabulin, a broad spectrum antiviral and anti-inflammatory agent, as a treatment for additional indications including influenza-related ARDS and other viral-associated ARDS.\n\uf0b7Develop and launch high value, novel biopharmaceutical products for advanced breast cancer.\nBreast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women with an estimated 290,560 new cases and 43,780 deaths expected for 2022 in the U.S. It is expected that one in eight women will develop invasive breast cancer in their lifetime. Breast cancer is a heterogenous disease with diverse clinical and molecular characteristics. Estrogen is one of the main drivers of breast cancer proliferation, tumor progression, and metastasis. Consequently, treatments that target the estrogen receptor (ER) have been the mainstay of breast cancer therapy, but unfortunately almost all women will eventually develop resistance to endocrine therapies and alternative treatment approaches will be required including IV chemotherapy.\nOur breast cancer pipeline includes enobosarm and sabizabulin. Enobosarm is an oral, first-in-class, new chemical entity, selective androgen receptor agonist that targets the AR in AR+ ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer without unwanted masculinizing side effects. Enobosarm is the first new class of targeted endocrine therapy in advanced breast cancer in decades. Enobosarm has extensive nonclinical and clinical experience having been evaluated in 25 separate clinical studies in over 2,100 subjects, including five prior Phase 2 clinical studies in advanced breast cancer involving more than 250 patients. In the two Phase 2 clinical studies conducted in women with AR+ ER+ HER2- breast cancer, enobosarm demonstrated significant antitumor efficacy in heavily pretreated patients and was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile.\nSabizabulin is an oral, first-in-class, new chemical entity that uniquely targets and crosslinks microtubules which are critical components of the cytoskeleton and a well-validated target for anticancer drugs. Sabizabulin has been evaluated initially in Phase 1b/2 clinical studies in 80 patients with advanced prostate cancer. Sabizabulin was well-tolerated and had promising evidence of antitumor activity. Sabizabulin could be evaluated in advanced breast cancer.\nWe have developed an extensive breast cancer program with a new focus on late-stage clinical study to evaluate enobosarm in combination with abemaciclib or sabizabulin in metastatic breast cancer. Global revenues for current oral therapies for advanced breast cancer are over $14 billion.\n\uf0b7Develop and launch high value, novel biopharmaceutical products for prostate cancer management.\nProstate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men with an estimated 268,490 new cases and 34,500 deaths expected for 2022 in the U.S. It is expected that one in eight men will develop prostate cancer in their lifetime. Prostate cancer has become a chronic disease with new challenges as prostate cancer develops resistance to current drugs and spreads throughout the body and as the patient suffers from the long-term side effects of these cancer treatments like hot flashes, bone loss and fractures, loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, and loss of muscle strength and frailty.\nOur prostate cancer pipeline includes sabizabulin, an oral novel microtubule disruptor, VERU-100, a long-acting GnRH antagonist depot, and zuclomiphene citrate, nonsteroidal estrogen receptor agonist - each of which seeks to address unmet medical needs in potentially large markets relating to advanced prostate cancer.\n\uf0b7Grow our sexual health program to invest proceeds in the clinical development of our drug pipeline with the goal of accessing large premium markets in COVID-19 and other viral ARDS-related diseases and in oncology.\noENTADFI\u2122 (tadalafil 5mg and finasteride 5mg capsule) is an FDA-approved combination of finasteride, a 5 alpha reductase inhibitor, and tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor indicated for the initial treatment of men with lower urinary tract symptoms from an enlarged prostate. ENTADFI is now commercially available nationwide and may also be marketed and distributed through telemedicine (telemedicine being the remote diagnosis and treatment of patients by means of telecommunications technology) partnership channels in the U.S.\noWe are working toward the goal of returning to revenue growth from FC2 in the U.S. market through prescription sales via our established dedicated direct to patient telemedicine and pharmacy services portal, while leveraging our relationships with telemedicine and pharmacy internet providers and distributors. We are also seeking to grow revenues in the public health sector in key U.S. and global markets via partnerships/distribution agreements with regional distributors/players.\n\uf0b7Capitalize on expertise and reputation of our management team and board members. Our management team has significant expertise and experience in urology, oncology, and infectious diseases as well as drug development, regulatory matters, marketing and sales, and business development which we believe facilitates effective management of our preclinical studies and clinical trials of drug candidates, potential launch planning, effective collaboration activity and product commercialization. In addition, we intend to capitalize on the strong reputations of the members of our management and board of directors with academic institutions, hospitals, physicians, pharmacists and distributors to expand our customer base and to introduce potential new products.\nOur Products and Product Candidates\nThe following table summarizes the Companys current product and development portfolio:\nDEVELOPMENT\nPRODUCT\nINDICATION\nPHASE\nCOVID-19 Drug Candidate\nSabizabulin - oral microtubule disruptor with dual antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities\nHospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients at risk for ARDS\nRequest for EUA submitted in the U.S. and similar applications in the EU and several other jurisdictions\nOncology Drug Candidates - Breast\nEnobosarm - selective androgen receptor agonist\nAR+ ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer with sufficient AR (3rd line metastatic setting)\nPhase 3 ARTEST ongoing\nSabizabulin - oral microtubule disruptor\nAR+ ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer with sufficient AR (3rd line metastatic setting)\nPlanned Phase 2b\nEnobosarm + abemaciclib combination therapy - selective androgen receptor agonist + CDK 4/6 inhibitor\nAR+ ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer with sufficient AR (2nd line metastatic setting)\nPhase 3 ENABLAR-2 ongoing\nOncology Drug Candidates - Prostate\nSabizabulin - oral microtubule disruptor\nMetastatic castration and androgen receptor targeting agent resistant prostate cancer\nPhase 1b/2 completed, Phase 3 VERACITY ongoing\nVERU-100 - long-acting GnRH antagonist peptide subcutaneous 3-month depot injection\nAdvanced hormone sensitive prostate cancer\nPhase 2 ongoing; Planned Phase 3\nZuclomiphene citrate - oral, nonsteroidal, estrogen receptor agonist\nHot flashes in men on ADT with advanced prostate cancer\nPhase 2 completed\nPlanned Phase 2b\nSexual Health Program Commercial Products\nENTADFI\u2122 - tadalafil 5mg and finasteride 5mg capsule\nInitial treatment of men with lower urinary tract symptoms from an enlarged prostate\nMarketed\nFC2 Female Condom\u00ae (internal condom)\nUnintended pregnancy and prevents STIs\nMarketed\nOur Clinical Trials Program and Our Drug Candidates\nInfectious Disease Program\nSabizabulin 9mg for the treatment of hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients at high risk for ARDS\nScientific Overview. Sabizabulin targets microtubules to provide a two-pronged approach against COVID-19 infection: first, as an antiviral, it would have direct effects on viral microtubule trafficking with the potential to reduce the production and release of infectious viruses, and second, as an anti-inflammatory agent, it may reduce virally-induced cytokine storm and severe inflammation leading to ARDS, septic shock, and death.\nThe Company has completed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 COVID-19 clinical trial, which was conducted in 204 hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients at high risk for ARDS and death. The primary endpoint was the proportion of deaths by Day 60. Based on a planned interim analysis of the first 150 patients randomized, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee unanimously halted the study for clear clinical efficacy benefit and no safety concerns were identified. Treatment with sabizabulin 9mg once daily resulted in a clinically meaningful and statistically significant 55.2% relative reduction in deaths compared to placebo receiving standard of care treatment. In the full study, there were 204 patients enrolled, and for the primary endpoint, there was a clinically meaningful and statistically significant 20.5% absolute reduction and 51.6% relative reduction in mortality at Day 60.\nOn May 10, 2022, the Company had a pre-EUA meeting with the FDA to discuss next steps including the submission of an EUA application regarding sabizabulin for COVID-19. The outcome of this meeting was: (i) the FDA agreed that no additional efficacy studies would be required to support an EUA application or a new drug application (NDA); and (ii) the FDA agreed that no additional safety data would be required to support an EUA application and that collection of safety data under the EUA may satisfy the safety requirement for an NDA. The FDA agreed that the request for the EUA is supported by efficacy and safety from our positive Phase 3 COVID-19 study in hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients who are at high risk for ARDS and death and no additional clinical trials are required to support an NDA submission. On June 7, 2022, the Company submitted a request for FDA emergency use authorization. On July 6, 2022, the Company announced the publication of the results from the Phase 3 COVID-19 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of oral sabizabulin in The New England Journal of Medicine Evidence. On November 9, 2022, the FDAs Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee (PADAC) met to review sabizabulin for the EUA in hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients who are at high risk for ARDS. The advisory committee voted 8-5 that the known and potential benefits of sabizabulin when used for the treatment of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at high risk of ARDS do not outweigh the known and potential risks of sabizabulin. However, there was additional discussion around the clinical trial design aspects of a potential confirmatory Phase 3 COVID-19 clinical trial as a post emergency use authorization requirement. The FDA considers the input of the advisory committee as part of their review of the EUA, but the FDA makes the final decision on the request for EUA application.\nThe UKs MHRA informed the Company on July 25, 2022, that the sabizabulin marketing authorization application will receive expedited review. On July 27, 2022, sabizabulin triggered Article 18 in the EU in which the EMA will evaluate sabizabulin to allow emergency use drug access to the EU Member States. On August 22, 2022, Australias TGA determined that sabizabulin treatment in hospitalized COVID-19 patients at high risk for ARDS qualifies for an expedited, provisional registration regulatory pathway.\nDevelopment Plan. Based on the positive Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety profile of sabizabulin 9mg for the treatment of hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients at high risk for ARDS and death, the Company is investigating a number of other clinical trials in infectious diseases for sabizabulin such as: (i) hospitalized COVID-19 patients classified as WHO 3 (no oxygen requirement) and WHO 4 (passive oxygen) without a co-morbidity; (ii) hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 pediatric patients at high risk for ARDS; and (iii) hospitalized adult patients at high risk for ARDS due to other viral induced ARDS-related diseases, including influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).\nMarket. Approximately 20% of symptomatic cases require hospitalization with 5% ending up in the ICU. According to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been approximately 97.1 million confirmed COVID cases and approximately 1.1 million deaths in the U.S. as of October 31, 2022.\nOncology Drug Program - Breast Cancer: enobosarm and sabizabulin\nScientific Overview. In the U.S., breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women with an estimated 290,560 new cases and 43,780 deaths expected for 2022 with one in eight women developing invasive breast cancer in their lifetime. Breast cancer is heterogenous disease with diverse clinical and molecular characteristics. The initial molecular assessment is to determine hormone receptor status, ER and progesterone receptor (PR), as well as HER2 status. Up to 85% of breast cancers are ER+, and consequently, estrogen is one of the main drivers of breast cancer proliferation, tumor progression, and metastasis. Treatments that target the ER have been the mainstay of breast cancer therapy, but unfortunately almost all women will eventually develop resistance to endocrine therapies and alternative treatment approaches will be required including IV chemotherapy. Metastatic triple negative breast cancer is an aggressive form of breast cancer that occurs in approximately 15% of all breast cancers. This form of breast cancer does not express ER, PR, or HER2 and is resistant to endocrine therapies. The first line of treatment usually includes IV taxane chemotherapy. Almost all women will eventually develop drug resistance and have tumor progression.\nTargeting the AR has the potential to be the next important endocrine therapy for women with breast cancer. 1) AR is the most abundantly expressed steroid receptor in breast cancer being detected in between 70 to 95% of breast cancer specimens; 2) Androgen receptor agonists inhibit cellular proliferation and have antitumor efficacy in ER+ human breast cancer models; and 3) the presence of AR in breast cancer specimens predicts favorable disease-free survival and overall survival.\nEnobosarm is an oral, first-in-class, new chemical entity that is a member of a new class of endocrine drugs called selective androgen receptor agonists, which means it is both an agonist and an antagonist depending on the tissue type. Enobosarm binds to the AR in breast tissue and inhibits AR+ ER+ breast cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth in animal models. Unlike testosterone, enobosarm cannot be aromatized to estrogen. Enobosarm has selective clinical properties that could have potential benefit in women with AR+ ER+ HER2- breast cancer. Preclinical studies have shown that enobosarm builds and heals cortical and trabecular bone with the potential to treat osteoporosis and skeletal related cancer events. Enobosarm has been shown to build muscle and improve physical function, as well as reduce fat, in clinical studies involving elderly subjects and patients with cancer cachexia including breast cancer. Furthermore, the tissue selectivity of enobosarm results in a favorable side effect profile with no masculinizing adverse effects (facial hair and acne), no increase in hematocrit, and no liver toxicity. Enobosarm has extensive nonclinical and clinical experience having been evaluated in 25 separate clinical studies in approximately 1,450 subjects dosed, including three Phase 2 clinical studies in advanced AR+ ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer involving more than 250 patients.\nSabizabulin is an oral, first-in-class small molecule that targets, binds to, and crosslinks the alpha and beta tubulin subunits of microtubules to arrest dividing cancer cells. Furthermore, sabizabulin causes apoptosis, or cell death by cleaving poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) which is important for DNA repair in cancer cells. Sabizabulin has high oral bioavailability; less possibility for drug resistance as it does not interact with multiple drug resistance proteins (P-glycoprotein); and minimal potential for drug-to-drug interactions. Sabizabulin has shown in preclinical studies to have efficacy against many tumor types including castration resistant prostate cancer, triple negative breast cancer resistant to anthracyclines and taxanes as well as ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, leukemia, glioma, and pancreatic cancer.\nEnobosarm for the treatment of AR+ ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer. In the two Phase 2 clinical studies conducted in women with AR+ ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer, enobosarm demonstrated significant antitumor efficacy in heavily pretreated cohorts and was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile.\nThe first Phase 2 clinical trial (G200801) was a single arm study evaluating 9mg oral daily dose of enobosarm in a heavily pretreated endocrine resistant cohort of 22 subjects with AR+ ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer. The patients participating in the study on average had 3 (range 1-5) previous lines of endocrine therapy and 68% had previous chemotherapy. The CBR at 6 months was 35.3% (90% CI:16.6%, 58%). Progression free probability was 57.5% at Day 84 and 50.5% at Day 168. The 6-month Kaplan-Meier estimate for radiographic progression free survival was 43.8%. Enobosarm was well tolerated without evidence of masculinization, no increase in hematocrit, and no liver toxicity.\nThe second Phase 2 clinical trial (G200802) was a 2-arm study evaluating 9mg and 18mg enobosarm daily oral dosing in 136 women with AR+ ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer. The patients in this study were also heavily pretreated having failed an average of 3.7 endocrine treatments, 90% had received prior chemotherapy, and 12% had prior treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitor. Enobosarm showed efficacy with a CBR at 6 months which for 9mg was 32% (95% CI 19.5%,46.7%) and for the 18mg cohort was 29% (95% CI 17.1%,43.1%). The median duration of clinical benefit was not reached for the 9mg group (8.2 month - Not reached) and for the 18mg group was 14.1 months (11 months - 16.5 months). A post-hoc AR expression subset analysis using the AR testing measure used in G200802 was also performed in this population with known AR status and measurable disease (n=84). Objective tumor responses correlated with the degree of % AR staining. Using a 40% AR staining cutoff, CBR at 24 weeks for \u226540% AR was 52% and <40% AR was 14% (p<0.0004). Overall response rate in subjects with \u226540% AR staining was 34% and <40% AR was 2.7% (p=0.0003). Median radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) for \u226540% AR was 5.47 months (95% CI 2.83-11.13) versus <40% AR was 2.73 months (95% CI 2.63 - 2.80) (p<0.001). Enobosarm treatment was well tolerated with significant positive effects on quality-of-life measurements. The 9 mg group had a slightly better safety profile than the 18 mg group.\nIn summary, treatment with enobosarm, a novel oral selective androgen receptor agonist, resulted in clinically significant objective tumor responses, improvement in quality of life, and favorable safety profile in a heavily pretreated population of women with AR+ER-HER2- metastatic breast cancer. Higher % AR nuclei staining correlated with a greater antitumor activity. By targeting and activating AR in breast cancer tumors with sufficient AR expression, women with metastatic breast cancer may be identified who are most likely to respond to enobosarm therapy. Overall, these studies of enobosarm clearly establish the clinical relevance of targeting the AR with a selective AR agonist. Enobosarm introduces a novel endocrine therapy to patients with breast cancer that have exhausted endocrine therapies targeting ER, but prior to IV chemotherapy.\nDevelopment Plan: Current and Planned Clinical Trials.\n\uf0b7Phase 3 clinical study - Enobosarm as a 3rd line treatment of AR+ER+HER2- metastatic breast cancer. We are enrolling the Phase 3 multicenter, international, open label, and randomized (1:1) ARTEST registration clinical trial design to evaluate the efficacy and safety of enobosarm monotherapy versus physicians choice of either exemestane \uf0b1 everolimus or a SERM as the active comparator for the treatment of AR+ ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer in approximately 210 patients with sufficient AR nuclei staining in their breast cancer tissue who had tumor progression on a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor, fulvestrant, and a CDK4/6 inhibitor. We have identified that patients who have sufficient androgen receptor nuclei staining in their breast cancer tissue are most likely to respond to enobosarm. Based on the recommendation of the FDA to have a companion diagnostic test to determine the patients AR status, we are partnering with Roche/Ventana Diagnostics, a global oncology diagnostics company, who will develop and commercialize a companion diagnostic AR test.\n\uf0b7Phase 2b clinical study - Sabizabulin as a 3rd line treatment of AR+ER+HER2- metastatic breast cancer. We also intend to conduct a Phase 2b clinical study of sabizabulin, a novel oral microtubule disruptor, for the treatment of AR+ ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer in patients with sufficient AR nuclei staining. The Phase 2b clinical trial will be an open label, multicenter, and randomized (1:1) study evaluating the efficacy and safety of sabizabulin 32mg monotherapy versus active comparator (exemestane \u00b1 everolimus or a SERM, physicians choice) for the treatment of ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer in approximately 200 patients with sufficient AR nuclei staining in their breast cancer tissue who had tumor progression on a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor, fulvestrant, and a CDK4/6 inhibitor.\n\uf0b7Phase 3 clinical study - Enobosarm + abemaciclib combination as a 2nd line treatment of AR+ER+HER2- metastatic breast cancer. We are enrolling a Phase 3 multicenter, open label, randomized (1:1), active control clinical study, named ENABLAR-2 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of enobosarm plus abemaciclib combination therapy versus an alternative estrogen blocking agent (fulvestrant or an aromatase inhibitor) in subjects with AR+ ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer who have failed first line palbociclib (a CDK 4/6 inhibitor) plus an estrogen blocking agent (non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant) and have a sufficient AR nuclei staining in their breast cancer tissue. We plan to enroll approximately 186 subjects in this Phase 3 clinical study.\nMarket. Enobosarm represents the first new class of targeted endocrine therapy in advanced breast cancer in decades. Enobosarm targets AR in AR+ ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer as a potential second line and/or third line oral daily dosing endocrine therapy. Oral sabizabulin could provide a non-endocrine oral therapy. Both enobosarm and sabizabulin could be an option in hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer patients that have exhausted endocrine therapies targeting ER, but prior to IV chemotherapy. We believe that the global annual market for an oral agent in an ER endocrine resistant setting would be similar to that for CDK 4/6 inhibitor drugs which is an $18 billion dollar market.\nOncology Drug Program - Prostate Cancer: sabizabulin, VERU-100 and zuclomiphene citrate\nSabizabulin, an oral, first-in-class microtubule disruptor small molecule for the treatment of metastatic castration resistant and androgen receptor targeting agent resistant prostate cancer.\nScientific Overview. In the U.S. there were an estimated 268,490 new cases and 34,500 deaths from prostate cancer expected in 2022. Five percent of men with prostate cancer will have metastatic cancer and up to 30% of men with high-risk, localized prostate cancer will develop metastatic cancer following initial therapy in the U.S. The median survival of patients with metastatic prostate cancer ranges from 3.2-4.5 years. For these men, the first line therapy is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), or medical castration. Although most will initially respond, nearly all these patients will progress to metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer and have a poor prognosis with an average survival of 1.5 years. New second line androgen receptor targeting agents, like XTANDI\u00ae (enzalutamide) and ZYTIGA\u00ae (abiraterone acetate) have resulted in an additional four to five months of average survival, but again, nearly all men on these agents will eventually develop progressive metastatic castration resistant and androgen receptor targeting agent prostate cancer within 12-15 months.\nSabizabulin is an oral, first-in-class small molecule that targets, binds to, and crosslinks the alpha and beta tubulin subunits of microtubules of cells resulting in disruption of the cytoskeleton. Furthermore, sabizabulin causes apoptosis, or cell death by cleaving poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) which is important for DNA repair in cancer cells. Sabizabulin has high oral bioavailability, less possibility for drug resistance as it does not interact with multiple drug resistance proteins (P-glycoprotein), and minimal potential for drug-to-drug interactions. Sabizabulin has shown in preclinical studies to have efficacy against many tumor types including castration resistant prostate cancer, triple negative breast cancer resistant to anthracyclines and taxanes as well as ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, leukemia, glioma, and pancreatic cancer. In current clinical prostate cancer studies, sabizabulin appears to be well tolerated with no clinically meaningful neurotoxicity and no neutropenia, which are common side effects of taxanes and vinca alkaloids anti-microtubule chemotherapy agents.\nDevelopment Plan. The Company is developing sabizabulin as a treatment for men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer who have also become resistant to androgen receptor targeting agents like ZYTIGA\u00ae (abiraterone) or XTANDI\u00ae (enzalutamide) and prior to proceeding to IV chemotherapy (prechemotherapy). In September 2018, the Company completed a pre-Investigational New Drug Application (IND) meeting with the FDA for sabizabulin in which the FDA agreed with the Companys plans for a Phase 1b and Phase 2 clinical trials. The Company submitted an IND and initiated an open label Phase 1b clinical trial in January 2019 at Johns Hopkins Cancer Center and four other clinical centers. The Phase 1b clinical study has completed enrollment of 39 men with castration resistant prostate cancer who have become resistant to androgen receptor targeting agent and may have had prior taxane IV chemotherapy. Based on the Phase 1b clinical study, the recommended Phase 2 dose is 63mg oral daily continuous dosing as daily chronic drug administration appears to be feasible and safe. The recommended Phase 2 dose is well tolerated as there have been no reports of neutropenia, neurotoxicity, or Grade 3 diarrhea. The Phase 2 clinical study has completed enrollment of approximately 41 men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer who have also become resistant to androgen receptor targeting agents, such as abiraterone, enzalutamide, or apalutamide, but prior to proceeding to IV chemotherapy. In the Phase1b/2 clinical studies, there was evidence of both cytotoxic and cytostatic antitumor efficacy including PSA declines and objective tumor responses (partial and complete responses), and sabizabulin was well tolerated with no reported clinically relevant neutropenia or neurotoxicity. The safety profile appears to be similar to what has been reported in the FDA package inserts for an androgen receptor targeting agent, enzalutamide or abiraterone.\nIn July 2020, the Company had a meeting with the FDA and received positive input from the FDA on the pivotal Phase 3 trial design for sabizabulin. The Phase 3 VERACITY clinical study, initiated in June 2021, is an open label, randomized (2:1), multicenter, registration study evaluating sabizabulin 32mg daily dosing versus an alternative androgen receptor targeting agent as the active control in men who have metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer and who had tumor progression while taking at least one androgen receptor targeting agent, but prior to IV chemotherapy. The Phase 3 VERACITY study has a primary endpoint of median radiographic progression-free survival and is currently enrolling, and we expect to enroll 245 men from approximately 45 clinical sites across the U.S.\nCurrent and Planned Clinical Trials\n\uf0b7Phase 1b/2 clinical studies to determine maximum tolerated dose and recommended dosing of sabizabulin. We are completing the Phase 1b open label clinical trial of sabizabulin in 39 men with metastatic castration resistant and androgen receptor targeting agent resistant prostate cancer \u00b1 taxane chemotherapy and the Phase 2 clinical study in 41 men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer who have also become resistant to at least one androgen receptor targeting agent, but prior to proceeding to IV taxane chemotherapy. In the Phase 1b/2 studies, sabizabulin was both well tolerated and demonstrated promising preliminary efficacy data.\n\uf0b7Phase 3 VERACITY clinical study. We are currently enrolling the Phase 3 VERACITY registration study evaluating sabizabulin 32mg in approximately 245 men who have metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer and who had tumor progression while receiving at least one androgen receptor targeting agent, but prior to IV chemotherapy.\nMarket. Sabizabulin 32mg is being developed for metastatic castration resistant and androgen receptor targeting agent resistant prostate cancer prior to IV chemotherapy. The potential U.S. market for oral cancer therapies in advanced prostate cancer is expected to be over $6.5 billion in 2022. Furthermore, sabizabulin may be a candidate for further development for the broader oncology market as it has shown in preclinical studies to have efficacy against many other tumor types, including triple negative breast cancer resistant to anthracyclines and taxanes as well as ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, leukemia, glioma, and pancreatic cancer.\nVERU-100, a novel, proprietary, long-acting, GnRH antagonist peptide three-month depot subcutaneous injection formulation for androgen deprivation therapy for advanced hormone sensitive prostate cancer.\nScientific Overview. Androgen deprivation therapy remains the mainstay primary first line therapy for advanced prostate cancer, but current androgen deprivation therapy products, such as LUPRON DEPOT\u00ae (leuprolide acetate for depot suspension), for injection; ELIGARD\u00ae (leuprolide acetate), for injectable suspension, for subcutaneous use; FIRMAGON\u00ae (degarelix for injection), for subcutaneous use; and ZOLADEX\u00ae (goserelin implant) have several important clinical shortfalls. LUPRON, ELIGARD, and ZOLADEX are LHRH agonists whose initial administration leads to an initial 14 to 21-day testosterone surge (flare) and interval micro-elevations (spikes or escapes) in testosterone blood concentrations. FIRMAGON, a GnRH antagonist, is a large-volume subcutaneous injection formulation designed for only a single month release. FIRMAGON requires a loading dose of two 3 mL subcutaneous injections followed by a monthly maintenance dose of 4 mL subcutaneous injection repeated. ORGOVYX\u00ae (relugolix tablets), an oral GnRH antagonist may potentially have compliance concerns through a patients reluctance or failure to take oral medicine as prescribed. There are no GnRH antagonist depot formulations commercially approved beyond a one-month duration injection. In contrast, VERU-100 is designed to address a number of these important clinical shortfalls of currently marketed androgen deprivation therapy products: VERU-100 is a long-acting GnRH antagonist designed to be administered as a small volume subcutaneous three-month depot injection without a loading dose. VERU-100, as a GnRH antagonist, immediately suppresses testosterone with no testosterone surge upon initial or repeated administration unlike what occurs with the currently approved LHRH agonists. As VERU-100 is a long-acting injected depot, there are no concerns with patient compliance while on treatment. Furthermore, as a class, GnRH antagonists have been shown to have fewer cardiovascular adverse events than LHRH agonists in men on androgen deprivation therapy.\nDevelopment Plan. The Company had a Pre-IND meeting with the FDA in May 2019 clarifying the requirements for full regulatory development pathway. The FDA agreed to an expedited regulatory development pathway for VERU-100. The Company is conducting a single Phase 2 dose finding, open label, multicenter clinical study of VERU 100 in men with advanced prostate cancer (approximately 45 patients) for a single three-month injection. As of November 15, 2022, 22 patients have been dosed in the Phase 2 study. FDA has agreed to the design of the registration study which will be a Phase 3-open label single arm clinical study in men with advanced prostate cancer (n=100) using the achievement and maintenance of castration levels of testosterone as the primary endpoint.\nCurrent and Planned Clinical Trials\n\uf0b7Phase 2 dose finding clinical study. Currently enrolling study to determine optimal dose of VERU-100 in men with advanced hormone sensitive prostate cancer.\n\uf0b7Phase 3 registration clinical study. If the Phase 2 trial is successful, and as discussed with and agreed upon by the FDA, the Phase 3 clinical trial will be a single arm, multicenter, open-label study in approximately 100 men with hormone sensitive advanced prostate cancer using the achievement and maintenance of castration levels of testosterone as the primary endpoint. The Phase 3 registration study is planned to initiate in calendar year 2023.\nMarket. VERU-100 is a long-acting GnRH antagonist for androgen deprivation therapy designed to be administered as a small volume subcutaneous three-month depot injection without a loading dose. Currently, there are no GnRH antagonists commercially approved beyond a one-month depot injection, making VERU-100, if approved, the only commercially available GnRH antagonist three-month depot. Global sales of androgen deprivation therapy drugs in 2022 are estimated to be greater than $2.9 billion.\nZuclomiphene citrate for the treatment of hot flashes caused by prostate cancer hormonal therapies in men with advanced prostate cancer.\nScientific Overview. The estimated prevalence of prostate cancer in the U.S. is 3 million cases for which over one-third are on androgen deprivation therapy. Androgen deprivation therapy results in very low, castrate levels of testosterone. Eliminating testosterone is an effective therapy as testosterone is a powerful growth factor for prostate cancer. As estrogen is derived from testosterone in men, low levels in testosterone also results in very low levels of estrogen. Low estrogen side effects include hot flashes, bone loss and fractures, loss of libido, memory disturbances, and adverse blood lipid changes.\nHot flashes, also known as vasomotor symptoms, are one of the most common and debilitating side effects of prostate cancer hormonal therapies. Hormone therapies include ADT, like LUPRON\u00ae and ELIGARD\u00ae (leuprolide), FIRMAGON\u00ae (degarelix), ZOLADEX\u00ae (goserelin), ORGOVYX\u00ae (relugolix tablets), as well as the newer agents approved to treat advanced prostate cancer such as ZYTIGA\u00ae (abiraterone), XTANDI\u00ae (enzalutamide), ERLEADA\u00ae (apalutamide), and NUBEQA\u00ae (darolutamide). Up to 80% of men on androgen deprivation therapy complain of hot flashes with 30-40% having moderate to severe hot flashes. Patients on androgen deprivation therapy report significant effects on daily functioning and quality of life. Hot flashes are one of the main reasons that prostate cancer patients want to delay or stop being treated by androgen deprivation therapy.\nHormonal and nonhormonal therapies have been used off-label to treat hot flashes in men on prostate cancer hormonal therapies. In general, use of off-label hormonal agents, especially estrogens, have been shown to be helpful for treating hot flashes. However, off-label estrogen treatment is complicated by lack of consistent dosing and known side effects such as gynecomastia (breast enlargement), gynecodynia (painful breasts), and increase in thromboembolic events like deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, and stroke. Progesterone hormone agents, like MEGACE ES\u00ae (megesterol acetate suspension), have also been used off-label but the side effects include weight gain, increase in thromboembolic events like deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, and stroke, and the potential to stimulate the growth of prostate cancer. Nonhormonal agents that also have been used off-label include antiseizure agents and antidepressants that have serious and unwanted side effects. Moreover, nonhormonal agents have demonstrated less effectiveness than hormonal therapies for the treatment of hot flashes. There are no FDA-approved therapies for hot flashes caused by prostate cancer hormonal therapy in men with advanced prostate cancer. As estrogen deficiency is the reason for the hot flashes, we believe that zuclomiphene citrate, a nonsteroidal estrogen receptor agonist, has the potential to replace estrogen and be an efficacious and well tolerated treatment for hot flashes caused by androgen deprivation therapy in men with advanced prostate cancer.\nDevelopment Plan. In June 2018, the Company submitted an IND with the FDA for zuclomiphene citrate. In September 2018, the Company enrolled its first subject in the Phase 2 double-blind randomized placebo-controlled dose finding study evaluating two doses of oral daily zuclomiphene citrate (10mg or 50mg) treatment versus placebo in approximately 95 men with advanced prostate cancer who have ADT induced moderate to severe hot flashes. The clinical study had a treatment duration of 12 weeks and was being conducted in 24 clinical centers in the U.S. The primary endpoint was the frequency of moderate to severe hot flashes. Secondary endpoints included severity of hot flashes and improvement in bone marker. Upon review of the Phase 2 clinical data, we believe a higher dose of zuclomiphene may be more efficacious against hot flashes with acceptable safety. Consequently, the Company plans to further optimize the dosing of zuclomiphene citrate in a Phase 2b clinical trial in men with advanced prostate cancer who experience moderate to severe hot flashes.\nPlanned Clinical Trial\n\uf0b7Phase 2b zuclomiphene citrate clinical study. The Company reported positive dose finding Phase 2 study in January 2020. The Company plans to further optimize the dosing schedule of zuclomiphene citrate in a Phase 2b study.\nMarket. Hot flashes are the most common side effect of prostate cancer hormone therapy, with hot flashes occurring in approximately 80% of men receiving one of the common forms of androgen deprivation therapy, including like LUPRON\u00ae and ELIGARD\u00ae (leuprolide), FIRMAGON\u00ae (degarelix), ZOLADEX\u00ae (goserelin), ORGOVYX\u00ae (relugolix tablets), as well as the newer agents approved to treat advanced prostate cancer such as ZYTIGA\u00ae (abiraterone), XTANDI\u00ae (enzalutamide), ERLEADA\u00ae (apalutamide), and NUBEQA\u00ae (darolutamide, and about up to 40% of such men experience moderate to severe hot flashes. The potential patient population for zuclomiphene citrate is the approximately 480,000 men annually in the U.S. who suffer from ADT-induced hot flashes. There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for hot flashes associated with prostate cancer hormonal therapies.\nSexual Health Program\nThe Company's sexual health program includes two FDA-approved commercial products, ENTADFI\u2122 (tadalafil and finasteride) capsules, for oral use, for the treatment of BPH, and FC2, for the dual protection against unplanned pregnancy and the transmission of sexually transmitted infections.\nENTADFI\u2122 (finasteride and tadalafil) capsules, for oral use. ENTADFI was approved by the FDA in December 2021 as a new oral treatment for BPH, or an enlarged prostate gland. The co-administration of tadalafil and finasteride has been shown to provide faster and more effective treatment of BPH than finasteride alone without causing unwanted sexual side effects. The FDA had been reviewing our product release criteria from our contract manufacturing facility and has now given its approval. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we initiated the U.S. commercial launch and availability of ENTADFI. We plan to market ENTADFI to healthcare providers and patients through the traditional digital marketing channels and distribution will also be conducted through the normal pharmaceutical distribution channels. We plan to augment our marketing and sales efforts by seeking partners in the U.S. that offer us the ability to expand access through telemedicine and internet pharmacy services and will continue our search for the right commercial partners outside the U.S.\nMarket. The worldwide prevalence of BPH lower urinary symptoms is estimated to be 10-25% of the male population. According to IQVIA, the top 3 deciles of Urologist (n = 958) Healthcare Practitioners in the U.S. average 775 finasteride total prescriptions per health care provider per year. ENTADFI is an FDA-approved, first in class combination of tadalafil and finasteride indicated to treat BPH with low potential for adverse sexual side effects, and we believe that ENTADFI being one single pill would help increase drug compliance whereas poor compliance with a BPH medicine could lead to an increased chance of acute urinary retention, urosepsis, and death.\nFC2 Female Condom for dual protection against unintended pregnancy and transmission of sexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDs\nProduct. FC2 is the only FDA-approved internal condom for the prevention of pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, and HIV/AIDs. It is also the only non-hormonal, latex free contraceptive option available to women that can be used with most other forms of contraception providing layering benefits. It is easy to use and covered by most insurance companies with zero out-of-pocket costs due to the Affordable Care Act.\nFC2 offers several benefits over natural rubber latex, the raw material most used in male condoms. FC2s nitrile polymer is stronger than latex, reducing the probability that the female condom sheath will tear during use. Unlike latex, FC2s nitrile polymer quickly transfers heat. FC2 can warm to body temperature immediately upon insertion, which may enhance the users sensation and pleasure. Unlike the male condom, FC2 may be inserted before sex, eliminating disruption during sexual intimacy. FC2 is also an alternative to latex sensitive users who are unable to use male condoms without irritation. For example, 7% to 21% of the individuals with significant exposure to latex rubber (i.e., health care workers) experience such irritation. To the Company's knowledge, there is no reported allergy to the nitrile polymer. FC2 is pre-lubricated, disposable, and approved for single use to prevent pregnancy and the transfer of sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\nFC2 is manufactured from a nitrile polymer formulation that is proprietary to the Company and consists of a soft, loose-fitting sheath and two rings: an external ring of rolled nitrile and a loose internal ring made of flexible polyurethane. FC2s soft sheath lines the vagina, preventing skin-to-skin contact during intercourse. Its external ring remains outside the vagina, partially covering the external genitalia. The internal ring is used for insertion and helps keep the device in place during use.\nIn the U.S., FC2 is available by prescription through multiple telemedicine and internet pharmacy channels as well as retail pharmacies. The Company has launched its own dedicated direct to patient telemedicine and pharmacy services portal/platform to continue to drive sales growth. FC2 is also available to public health sector entities such as state departments of health and 501(c)(3) organizations.\nCurrently, most of the Companys net revenues are derived from sales of FC2 in the commercial and public health sectors.\nU.S. Market. There are approximately 19 million women between the ages of 18-49 who represent the target market within the contraceptive market. According to the CDC, preliminary data suggests that STIs in U.S. will continue to increase in 2021 - an all-time high for the 6th straight year increasing from 2.4 million to 2.5 million.\nFC2 is the only FDA approved for market female use product that protects against unintended pregnancies, the transmission of STIs and HIV/AIDs. While the market conditions are favorable for continued growth, the brand has seen decreasing sales due to lower volume from telemedicine customers because of some business challenges experienced by our customers which has resulted in a slow-down in orders over the past two quarters. As a result, the Company has established its own dedicated direct to patient telemedicine (telemedicine being the remote diagnosis and treatment of patients by means of telecommunications technology) platform and we have recently partnered with highly reputable telemedicine pharmacy fulfillment partner to bring our much-needed FC2 product to patients in a cost-effective and highly convenient manner. We are working to restore historical ordering patterns with these partners in future quarters and we are working to grow revenues from our dedicated telemedicine solution while leveraging opportunities that help couples better understand how FC2 can help them take control of their sexual and reproductive health.\nFC2 is currently reimbursable by prescription under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ACA was signed into law in March 2010 and was intended to help make prevention services affordable and accessible for all Americans by requiring most health insurance plans to provide coverage without cost sharing for certain recommended preventive services. Preventive services that have strong scientific evidence of their health benefits must be covered and plans can no longer charge a patient a copayment, coinsurance or deductible for these services when they are delivered by a network provider. ACA guidance defines preventive services to include contraception methods. The ACA guidance further requires health plans to cover at 100% payment of at least one form of contraception within each of the 16 different categories identified by the FDA in its current Birth Control Guide in which FC2 is in a standalone category of its own. As FC2 is nonhormonal, it is a viable alternative for many U.S. women who have reported dissatisfaction with the side effects of hormonal birth control or are seeking the layering (i.e. STI prevention) benefits FC2 offers since it can be used with many other forms of contraception.\nWe have built the infrastructure to allow for broad access across the U.S. As a result, FC2 is now available through multiple access channels including: 95% of major retail pharmacies, community-based organizations, by prescription, universities, direct purchase and 340B qualified health care clinics, and directly to the public health sector without distributors. Additionally, we are executing digital and social marketing strategies intended to drive brand interest, awareness, and education; address misconceptions about the brand; and ultimately, help ensure women know they can easily access FC2 and that it is fully reimbursable.\nGlobal Public Health Sector Market. In the global public sector, FC2 has been cleared by the World Health Organization (WHO) for purchase by U.N. agencies because it is a multipurpose prevention technology by preventing unintended pregnancy and the transmission of STIs, while protecting against HIV/AIDs. The Company markets FC2 to entities, including ministries of health, government health agencies, U.N. agencies, nonprofit organizations, and commercial partners, that work to support and improve the lives, health and well-being of women around the world since various governments and organizations supply critical products such as FC2, at no cost or low cost, to those who need but cannot afford to buy such products for themselves.\nThe Company currently has a limited number of customers in the global public health sector that include large global agencies, such as the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Brazil Ministry of Health through Semina Ind\u00fastria e Com\u00e9rcio Ltda (Semina), the Companys distributor in Brazil, and the Republic of South Africa health authorities that purchase through the Companys various local distributors. Other customers in the global public health sector include ministries of health or other governmental agencies, which either purchase directly or via in-country distributors, local sexual health distributors and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).\nThe Company has sold more than 700 million female condoms worldwide and FC2 has been distributed in the U.S. and 149 other countries. A significant number of countries with the highest demand potential are in the developing world. The incidence of HIV/AIDS, other STIs, and unintended pregnancy in these countries represents a remarkable potential for significant sales of a product that benefits some of the worlds most underprivileged people. However, conditions in these countries can be volatile and result in unpredictable delays in program development, tender applications, and processing orders.\nThe global market for male condoms is estimated to be worth up to $9.4 billion annually. The female condom market represents a very small portion of the total global condom market, yet 53% of individuals living with HIV/AIDS are women. Consequently, a number of independent womens groups are advocating for increased investment in and distribution of female condoms on a gender equality basis.\nThe Company has distribution agreements and other arrangements with commercial partners which market FC2 as a consumer health product through distributors and retailers in 22 countries, including Brazil, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom. These agreements are generally exclusive for a single country. Under these agreements, the Company sells FC2 to the distributor partners, who market and distribute the product to consumers in the established territory.\nSale of PREBOOST\u00ae Business\nOn December 8, 2020, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Company sold substantially all of the assets related to the Company's PREBOOST\u00ae business. PREBOOST\u00ae is a 4% benzocaine medicated individual wipe for the treatment of premature ejaculation. The transaction closed on December 8, 2020. The purchase price for the transaction was $20.0 million, consisting of $15.0 million paid at closing, $2.5 million payable 12 months after closing and $2.5 million payable 18 months after closing. The Company has received all such purchase price payments.\nGovernment Regulation\nThe FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products and medical devices. These agencies and other federal, state, and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, tracking, approval, import, export, advertising, and promotion of our products.\nFDA Regulation of Female Condoms. FC2 was approved for market by the FDA, via a Premarket Approval Application (PMA), as a Class III medical device in 2009. On September 21, 2018, the FDA issued a final order reclassifying female condom from Class III to Class II medical devices, renaming them single-use internal condoms and requiring new devices in this category to submit a 510(k) premarket notification and comply with various special controls. Special controls are a battery of product clinical testing which includes, but is not limited to, determining product effectiveness against pregnancy and against sexual transmitted infection transmission, and product tolerability. Companies seeking clearance of new single-use internal condoms may now do so by demonstrating to the FDA in a 510(k) submission that a proposed condom is substantially equivalent to FC2 with respect to intended use and technology.\nAll marketed devices cleared or approved by the FDA are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA. For example, we are required to register our manufacturing establishments with the FDA and list FC2 with the FDA as a commercially distributed device. We must comply with the FDAs Quality System Regulation (QSR), which requires that devices be manufactured and records be maintained in a prescribed manner with respect to, among other things, manufacturing, testing, and control activities. We must comply with the Medical Device Reporting (MDR) regulation, which requires that we provide information to the FDA whenever evidence reasonably suggests that one of our FC2 devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or where a malfunction has occurred that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. We must also maintain records of any corrections or removal of FC2 and make reports to the FDA of certain corrections or removals. Further, we are required to comply with FDA requirements for labeling, promotion and advertising. Any future modifications to the design, components, methods of manufacturing, or labeling of FC2 that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, require a new 510(k) clearance. Non-compliance with any of these requirements can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, total or partial suspension of production, and criminal prosecution.\nBecause FC2 is a commercially distributed medical device, the facilities in which FC2 is manufactured and tested are subject to periodic FDA inspection to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, including the QSR and MDR regulations. The Companys most recent FDA inspection of its U.K. and Malaysian facilities was completed in September 2010 and November 2019, respectively.\nFDA Regulation of Prescription Pharmaceutical Products. The process required by the FDA before pharmaceutical product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:\n\uf0b7nonclinical laboratory and animal tests, including some that must be conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices;\n\uf0b7submission of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;\n\uf0b7adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug candidate for its intended use;\n\uf0b7pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and selected clinical investigators for their compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and current Good Clinical Practices (cGCP); and\n\uf0b7FDA approval of an NDA to permit commercial marketing for particular indications for use.\nThe testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources. Prior to commencing the first clinical trial with a drug candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial by imposing a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board (IRB) for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial commences at that center. Regulatory authorities, an IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Some studies also include a data safety monitoring board (DSMB) or independent data monitoring committee (IDMC), which receives special access to unblinded data during the clinical trial and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy.\nIn general, for purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.\n\uf0b7Phase 1-Studies are initially conducted to test the drug candidate for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion in healthy volunteers or patients.\n\uf0b7Phase 2-Studies are conducted with groups of patients with a specified disease or condition to provide enough data to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule, and expanded evidence of safety. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.\n\uf0b7Phase 3-These clinical trials are undertaken in larger patient populations to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy, and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. These trials may be done globally to support global registrations. A single Phase 3 or Phase 2 trial may be sufficient in rare instances, including (1) where the trial is a large, multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible, or (2) when in conjunction with other confirmatory evidence. Approval on the basis of a single trial may be subject to the requirement of additional post-approval studies.\nThe FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to be satisfied after approval. The results of Phase 4 studies can confirm the effectiveness of a drug candidate and can provide important safety information.\nConcurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug candidate, as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.\nEmergency Use Authorizations. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may authorize unapproved medical products to be manufactured, marketed, and sold in the context of an actual or potential emergency that has been designated by the government. After an emergency has been announced, the Secretary of Health and Human Services may authorize EUAs for the use of specific products based on criteria established by statute, including that the product at issue may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or preventing serious or life-threatening diseases when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. An EUA is subject to additional conditions and restrictions, such as the obligation to provide fact sheets for healthcare providers administering the product and those to whom it is administered, adverse event monitoring and reporting, and recordkeeping and reporting requirements by product manufacturers. The FDA may also establish additional discretionary conditions of authorization that the FDA deems necessary or appropriate to protect the public health, including conditions related to product distribution, product administration and data collection and analysis concerning the safety and effectiveness of the product. In issuing an EUA, the FDA considers the totality of available scientific evidence regarding quality, safety and efficacy, including the known and potential risks of such products and the adequacy and availability of approved alternatives, among other factors. An EUA is not a substitute for obtaining FDA approval, licensure, or clearance for use of a product. An EUA terminates when the emergency determination underlying the EUA terminates, and EUAs can be revoked under other circumstances, the timing of which may occur unexpectedly or be difficult to predict.\nOutside the U.S., the emergency use of medical products is subject to regulatory processes and requirements that differ from those in the U.S. These processes and requirements also vary widely from country to country, region to region, and regulatory authority to regulatory authority.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has been designated as a national emergency in the U.S. On the basis of such determination, the Secretary of Health and Human Services declared that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of drugs and biologics during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have submitted an application for an EUA in the US and similar applications in the United Kingdom and the European Union for sabizabulin in certain hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\n505(b)(2) Approval Process. Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), which was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, otherwise known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, provides an expedited regulatory pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved drug products. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon the FDA's findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved product that acts as the Reference Listed Drug (RLD). The FDA may require 505(b)(2) applicants to perform additional studies or provide other data to support any change from the RLD. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.\nWe expect our zuclomiphene citrate and VERU-100 drug candidates to be submitted under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway because they are or will be based, in part, on data or information already in the public domain.\nOrange Book Listing. In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicants product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly referred to as the Orange Book. Any applicant who files a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is not sought until after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the proposed new product. This last certification is known as a Paragraph IV certification. If the competitor has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the competitor must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the holder of the NDA for the RLD and the patent owner once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA holder or patent owner may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification prevents the FDA from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the date of the lawsuit, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain, or carves out, any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent.\n505(b)(1) Approval Process. Drug development via Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA is typically used for novel drugs that have not previously been approved by the FDA for commercial sale in the U.S or a new indication for a drug previously approved by the FDA for commercial sale in the U.S. 505(b)(1) drug development stipulates that all of the studies required for approval are conducted by or for the Company. Sabizabulin for metastatic castration and androgen receptor targeting agent resistant prostate cancer and sabizabulin for taxane resistant metastatic triple negative breast cancer, as well as enobosarm for ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer, and an NDA for sabizabulin for certain hospitalized COVID-19 and other infectious disease indications are expected to follow this regulatory pathway.\nNDA Submission and Review by the FDA. The results of product development, nonclinical studies, and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. The submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. The FDA reviews applications to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the manufacturing controls are adequate to assure and preserve the products identity, strength, quality, and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Once the NDA submission has been accepted for filing, which occurs, if at all, within 60 days after submission of the NDA, the FDAs goal to complete the review process for a non-priority review of an NDA under 505(b)(2) or 505(b)(1) is ten months from submission for a non-new chemical entity and ten months from filing for a new chemical entity and for a priority review is six months from submission for a non-new chemical entity and six months from filing for a new chemical entity to complete the review process for the application and respond to the applicant, which can take the form of either a complete response letter or approval. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDAs satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The review process is often significantly extended by the FDA requests for additional information, studies, or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information, and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. FDA approval of any NDA submitted by us will be at a time the FDA chooses. Also, if regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 post-marketing studies to monitor the effect of approved products and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.\nPost-Approval Requirements for Pharmaceutical Products. Any pharmaceutical products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences. Drug and biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements. If our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a product from distribution, or withdraw approval of the NDA.\nThe FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity, and potency that are supported by appropriate evidence. Generally, these are found in the approved prescribing information. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning or untitled letters, corrective advertising, and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the products labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturers communications on the subject of off-label use.\nThe Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes obligations on manufacturers of finished pharmaceutical human drug products related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements of this legislation, manufacturers are required to provide certain information regarding the drug products to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug products with a product identifier, and maintain certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Manufacturers are also required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this legislation, manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC) Regulation of Advertising. The FTC regulates OTC drug and non-restricted medical device advertising and promotional materials under the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act), which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices as well as the dissemination of any false advertisement that is likely to induce the purchase of drugs and non-restricted medical devices. The FTC requires that all express and implied claims must be substantiated. The FTC has historically applied a standard of competent and reliable scientific evidence for health-related claims. This standard is defined generally to require tests, analyses, research or studies that have been conducted and evaluated in an objective manner by qualified persons and are generally accepted in the profession to yield accurate and reliable results. In some instances, the FTC has interpreted this standard as requiring randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials. The FTC is authorized to issue cease-and-desist orders enforceable by injunctions, civil penalties, and criminal contempt proceedings for violating the FTC Act, as well as to proceed directly in federal court for injunctive relief and to obtain ancillary consumer redress.\nOther Healthcare Regulations. Our business activities, including but not limited to, research, sales, promotion, distribution, medical education, and other activities will be subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including potentially the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services and its various divisions, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and state and local governments. Our business activities must comply with numerous healthcare laws, including but not limited to, the federal health care program anti-kickback statute (the AKS) and state equivalents, the Federal False Claims Act and state equivalents, federal and state health care practitioner payment sunshine laws, federal and state health information privacy laws, state price increase transparency laws, and various federal laws requiring price reporting or discounted pricing to the government.\nThe AKS prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing, or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances.\nThe federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government.\nWe and our business activities are subject to the Medicare/Medicaid civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.\nAdditionally, the federal practitioner payment sunshine requirements within the ACA and its implementing regulations require certain manufacturers of drugs and medical devices for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Childrens Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians, certain other health care practitioners and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, such practitioners or teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.\nIn addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAAs privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates-independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Outside the U.S., we are impacted by the privacy and data security requirements at the international, national and regional level, and on an industry specific basis. Legal requirements in the countries in which we do business relating to the collection, storage, handling and transfer of personal data and potentially intellectual property continue to evolve with increasingly strict enforcement regimes. More privacy and security laws and regulations are being adopted, and more are being enforced, with potential for significant financial penalties. In the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took effect in May 2018 and imposes increasingly stringent data protection and privacy rules.\nDepending on the circumstances, failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties, including criminal, civil, and/or administrative criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion of products from reimbursement under government programs, qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, reputational harm, diminished profits, and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nThe U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals designed to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the U.S. and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the U.S., the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.\nAnti-Corruption Laws. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party, or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Other countries where the Company conducts business have similar anti-corruption laws, including the United Kingdoms Bribery Act.\nForeign and Other Regulation. In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to develop or sell any products outside of the U.S. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.\nFC2 has MSAP and ISO13485 approval by regulatory authorities which covers Australian TGA, Brazil ANVISA, Health Canada, and other jurisdictions. Also, FC2 received the CE Mark which allows it to be marketed throughout the EU.\nThe Companys facility may also be subject to inspection by UNFPA, USAID, International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and country specific ministries of health.\nIntellectual Property\nWe will be able to protect our technology from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent it is covered by valid and enforceable patents or is effectively maintained as trade secrets. Patents and other proprietary rights are an essential element of our business.\nSabizabulin and Related Compounds License. We hold an exclusive worldwide license to twelve issued U.S. patents, ten pending U.S. patent applications and 107 patents and patent applications in countries outside the United States, including issued patents in the EU and Japan, relating to our sabizabulin drug candidates and related compounds. This license contains provisions requiring upfront, milestone and royalty payments to the licensor (Ohio State Innovation Foundation). If we fail to comply with these obligations or other obligations to the licensor, the licensor might have the right to terminate the license, in which event we would not be able to commercialize these drug candidates. The patents and applications relating to sabizabulin and related compounds have statutory expiration dates from 2029 to 2041. Patent term adjustments or patent term extensions could result in later expiration dates with a maximum five-year patent term extension expected because of clinical development and FDA review time.\nOther Non-Sabizabulin Antitubulin Compounds License. We hold an exclusive worldwide license to two U.S. patent applications and one world patent application (PCT) from which we could enter many countries outside the U.S. This license is relating to non-sabizabulin anti-tubulin compounds. This license contains provisions requiring diligence milestones, and upfront, milestone and royalty payments to the licensor (University of Tennessee Research Foundation). If we fail to comply with these obligations or other obligations to the licensor, the licensor might have the right to terminate the license, in which event we would not be able to commercialize these drug candidates. The U.S. patent application and any patents issuing from the PCT patent applications would expire in April 2042.\nVERU-100 Patent Applications. We have three U.S. patent applications and fifteen patent applications in countries outside the United States relating to the long-term release of a GnRH antagonist hormone for ADT for men with advanced prostate cancer. The U.S. patent applications and any patents issuing from the foreign patent applications would expire in January 2038.\nEnobosarm and Related Compounds License. We hold an exclusive worldwide license to sixteen issued U.S. patents, seven pending U.S. patent applications and 67 patents and patent applications in countries outside the United States, including issued Composition of Matter and Method of Use patents in the EU and Japan, relating to our enobosarm drug candidate and related compounds. This license contains provisions requiring milestone and royalty payments to the licensor (University of Tennessee Research Foundation). If we fail to comply with these obligations or other obligations to the licensor, the licensor might have the right to terminate the license, in which event we would not be able to commercialize our drug candidate. The patents relating to enobosarm and related compounds have statutory expiration dates from 2024 to 2034. Patent term adjustments or patent term extensions could result in later expiration dates with a maximum five-year patent term extension expected because of clinical development and FDA review time.\nZuclomiphene Citrate Patent and Patent Applications. We have three issued U.S. patents and thirteen patents and patent applications in countries outside the United States related to substantially pure zuclomiphene for the treatment of hot flashes, osteoporosis, bone fractures, and loss of bone mineral density, especially in men on prostate cancer hormone therapies. The U.S. patent and any patents issuing from the foreign patent applications would expire in July 2035. Patent term adjustments or patent term extensions could result in later expiration dates with a maximum five-year patent term extension expected because of clinical development and FDA review time.\nFC2 Patents. FC2 patents have been issued by the United States, South Africa, Mexico, Brazil and India. The patents cover key aspects of FC2, including its overall design and manufacturing process. The patents have expiration dates in 2023 and 2024.\nTrademarks. The Company has a registration for the trademark FC2 Female Condom and the FC2 Female Condom stylized logo in the U.S. and a pending registration for ENTADFI and the ENTADFI stylized logo in the U.S. The Company has filed applications in the U.S. for the trademarks Veru and Veru together with the chevron. The Company has filed applications or secured registrations in 40 countries or jurisdictions around the world to protect the various names and symbols used in marketing its Female Condoms.\nWe cannot be certain that any of our pending patent applications, or those of our licensors, will result in issued patents. In addition, because the patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions, the patents we own and license, or any further patents we may own or license, may not prevent other companies from developing similar or therapeutically equivalent products. Patents also will not protect our product candidates if competitors devise ways of making or using these product candidates without legally infringing our patents. In recent years, several companies have been extremely aggressive in challenging patents covering pharmaceutical products, and the challenges have often been successful. We cannot be assured that our patents will not be challenged by third parties or that we will be successful in any defense we undertake. Failure to successfully defend a patent challenge could materially and adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, changes in patent laws, rules or regulations or in their interpretations or enforcement in the U.S. and other countries by the courts may materially diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nThe term of an individual patent depends upon the legal term for patents in the country in which such patent is obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patents term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the USPTO) in examining and granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent that covers a drug or biological product may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each medicine and other factors. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustment to the term of any of our patents.\nAs with other biopharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property positions for our product candidates will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, certain patent applications that we have filed or may file, or that we have licensed or may license from third parties, may not result in the issuance of corresponding patents. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. Any issued patents that we may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. For example, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending third-party patent applications. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim intellectual property to which we have rights, we may have to participate in proceedings in the USPTO to determine invention rights, which could result in substantial costs to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that any related patent may remain in force for a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent.\nIn addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by using confidentiality agreements with any future collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants and by using invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have agreements requiring assignment of inventions with selected consultants, scientific advisors and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements or clauses requiring invention assignment, to grant us ownership of intellectual property that is developed through a relationship with a third party.\nSignificant Customers\nThe Company's two largest customers in fiscal 2022 accounted for 73% of the Companys net revenues. In the U.S. market, the Company has experienced fast growth in prescription sales of FC2 in prior years largely through supply agreements with leading telemedicine providers.\nBecause FC2 is multipurpose prevention technology that provides prevention of pregnancy and transmission of STIs, including HIV/AIDS, it is an integral part of HIV/AIDS prevention and family planning programs throughout the world. These programs are typically supplied by global public health sector buyers who purchase products for distribution, at low cost or no cost, to those who need but cannot afford to buy such products themselves. Within the global public health sector are large global agencies, such as UNFPA, USAID, the U.K.s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), DKT and Population Services International (PSI), other social marketing groups, various government health agencies, and NGOs. Within the global public health sector, the Companys most significant customers are either global public health sector agencies, country specific ministries of health, or those who facilitate their purchases and/or distribution.\nHuman Capital Management\nAs of October 31, 2022, the Company had 233 full-time employees, including 65 located in the U.S., 11 in the U.K., 156 in Malaysia, and one in another country to implement training and programs. The Company does not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with its employees, and the Company believes that its employee relations are good.\nOur key human capital management objectives are to identify, recruit, integrate, retain and motivate our new and existing employees. We are committed to fostering an environment where all employees can grow and thrive. A diverse workforce results in a broader range of perspectives, helping drive our commitment to growth. We believe that our compensation and benefit programs are appropriately designed to attract and retain qualified talent. To create and maintain a successful work environment, we offer an annual base salary and a comprehensive package of additional benefits that support the physical and mental health and wellness of all of our employees and their families. Additionally, we may also grant equity awards to attract and promote employee retention, with such awards presently vesting over a three-year period, and to allow for employees to share in the performance of the Company.\nWe are committed to a safe workplace for our employees and have implemented health and safety management processes into our operations. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented additional safety measures for the protection of our employees, including work-from-home measures for applicable employees and additional cleaning and protective measures.\nEnvironmental Regulation\nThe Company believes there are no material issues or material costs associated with the Company's compliance with environmental laws. The Company did not incur environmental expenses in fiscal 2022 or 2021, nor does it anticipate environmental expenses in the foreseeable future. The Companys operations in Malaysia are audited and certified against ISO 14001, the environmental management standard that was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to help organizations manage the environmental impacts of their processes, products, and services.\nRaw Materials\nThe principal raw material used to produce FC2 is a nitrile polymer. While general nitrile formulations are available from a number of suppliers, the Company has chosen to work closely with the technical market leader in synthetic polymers to develop a grade ideally suited to the biocompatibility and functional needs of a female condom. As a result, the Company relies on supply for its principal raw material for FC2 from one supplier that could produce the raw material from multiple supply points within its organization. The principal partially finished component used to produce FC2 is a dipped nitrile polymer sheath. The Company procures its component sheaths from one of the leading manufacturers of nitrile surgical gloves.\nManufacturing\nWe manufacture and warehouse FC2 within a leased facility with approximately 45,800 square feet of space in Selangor D.E., Malaysia. Production capacity at this facility is approximately 100 million units of FC2 annually. This facility is subject to periodic inspection by the FDA to ensure compliance with cGMP, as well as the Germany-based notified body, which is responsible for CE and ISO accreditation.\nThe Company is relying on third-party contract manufacturers and other third parties to produce, package, label and store sufficient quantities of ENTADFI (tadalafil and finasteride) capsules, for oral use, and sabizabulin, which we have been manufacturing in anticipation of a potential Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA in the U.S. and potentially by regulatory authorities in other countries, and expects to rely on third-parties for any future drug candidates.\nCompetition\nFC2 participates in the same market as male condoms; however, it is not seen as directly competing with male condoms. Rather, studies show that providing FC2 increases use of female as well as male condoms. Male condoms cost less and can have brand names that are more widely recognized than FC2. In addition, male condoms are generally manufactured and marketed by companies with significantly greater financial resources than the Company.\nOther parties have developed and marketed female condoms. None of these female condoms marketed or under development by other parties have secured FDA market approval. FDA market approval is required to sell female condoms in the U.S. USAID, a U.S. government funded agency, prefers to procure from the FDA product approval for market; however, there can be exceptions. Outside of the U.S., the Company has experienced increasing competition and pricing pressures for FC2. In addition to FC2, three female condoms have successfully completed the WHO prequalification process and been cleared by UNFPA for purchase by U.N. agencies: the Cupid female condom (which was prequalified by WHO in July 2012 and cleared by UNFPA thereafter), the Velvet female condom marketed by Hindustan Latex Limited (which was prequalified by WHO and cleared by UNFPA in March 2016) and the female condom marketed by PATH (which was prequalified by WHO and cleared by UNFPA in March 2016). The PATH female condom lost its prequalification in 2019, which leaves only two other competitive female condoms with WHO prequalification in addition to FC2. We are not currently aware of any other female condoms currently in the WHO prequalification process. The female condom marketed by Hindustan Latex Limited, which is the Companys former exclusive distributor in India, is substantially similar in design to FC2, except it is made of latex. FC2 has also been competing with other female condoms in markets that do not require either FDA market approval or WHO prequalification, especially in the EU. Reflecting increased competition, competitors received part of the last three South African tenders and the last two Brazilian tenders. Increasing competition in FC2s markets outside the U.S. has, and will likely continue to, put pressure on pricing for FC2 and may also adversely affect sales of FC2. Some customers, particularly in the global public health sector, prioritize price over other features where FC2 may have an advantage. The FDAs reclassification of female condoms in 2018 from Class III medical devices to Class II medical devices may reduce the barriers for other types of female condoms to enter the U.S. market. If other female condoms enter the U.S. market, we may face increased competition in the U.S., which may put downward pressure on pricing for FC2 and adversely affect sales of FC2 in the U.S.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and is characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress. The success of our pharmaceutical products will depend on our ability to acquire, develop and commercialize products and our ability to establish and maintain markets for any products for which we receive marketing approval. Potential competitors in North America, Europe and elsewhere include major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology firms, universities and other research institutions and government agencies. Many of the competitors with respect to our pharmaceutical products under development have substantially greater research and development and regulatory capabilities and experience, and substantially greater management, manufacturing, distribution, marketing and financial resources, than we have or will have.\nSabizabulin is a first-in-class oral therapy that targets and crosslinks both alpha and beta tubulin and is being developed for hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients at high risk for ARDS and for breast and prostate cancers. Sabizabulin is first-in-class with this unique targeting and crosslinking of microtubules, which appears to have favorable results in efficacy and safety that is different from other tubulin targeting agents that do not crosslink. Other drugs for moderate to severe hospitalized COVID-19 patients at high risk for ARDS include antivirals like VEKLURY\u00ae (remdesivir), Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors such as OLUMIANT\u00ae (baricitinib), and monoclonal antibodies such as ACTEMRA\u00ae (tocilizumab).\nSabizabulin is also in development for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer no longer responding to androgen deprivation therapy and androgen receptor targeting therapy. All currently available tubulin targeting chemotherapy agents are given IV. Vinca Alkaloids, such as VELBAN\u00ae (VinBLAStine Sulfate) injection, for intravenous use; ONCOVIN\u00ae (vincristine sulfate injection, solution); and NAVELBINE\u00ae (vinrelbine) injection, for intravenous use are primarily used for hematologic malignancies (leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, sarcoma), and some neuroblastoma, thyroid cancer and non-small cell cancer of the lung. Taxanes such as TAXOL\u00ae (paclitaxel) injection, for intravenous use; TAXOTERE\u00ae (docetaxel) injection, for intravenous use; and JEVTANA\u00ae (cabazitaxel) injection, for intravenous use are primarily used for solid tumors such as breast, ovarian, endometrial, cervical, lung, head and neck, esophageal, bladder, gastric and prostate. TAXOTERE\u00ae (docetaxel) and JEVTANA\u00ae (cabazitaxel) are indicated for advanced metastatic prostate cancer, are given IV and bind to the taxane site of tubulin. The Trop-2 directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor, TRODELVY\u00ae (sacituzumab govitecan-hziy) for injection, for intravenous use; PARP inhibitors, LYNPARZA\u00ae (olaparib) tablets, for oral use and TALZENNA\u00ae (talazoparib) capsules, for oral use, capecitabine, TECENTRIQ\u00ae (atezolizumab) injection, for intravenous use and ABRAXANE\u00ae for Injectable Suspension (paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension) (albumin-bound), for intravenous use and platinum-based chemotherapies including cisplatin and PARAPLATIN\u00ae (carboplatin) injection are indicated for advanced breast cancers such as triple negative breast cancer.\nVERU-100 is a long-acting GnRH antagonist subcutaneous injection formulation for androgen deprivation therapy designed to be administered as a small volume subcutaneous three-month depot injection without a loading dose. As a GnRH antagonist, it should immediately suppress testosterone with no testosterone surge upon initial or repeated administration and no testosterone micro-increases which may adversely affect patient outcomes-a problem which potentially occurs with approved LHRH agonist drugs like LUPRON\u00ae, ZOLADEX\u00ae and ELIGARD\u00ae. Currently, there are no GnRH antagonists administered by depot injection that provide castration beyond one month, making VERU-100, if approved, the only commercially available GnRH antagonist three-month depot that would provide castration for such three-month period.\nEnobosarm is an oral, first-in-class, new chemical entity, selective androgen receptor targeting agonist, for the treatment of AR+ER+HER2- metastatic breast cancer, but prior to IV chemotherapy. Other existing drugs currently prescribed for advanced breast cancer are nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors including, FEMARA\u00ae (letrozole) tablets, for oral use and ARIMIDEX\u00ae (anastrozole) tablet, for oral use; irreversible steroidal inhibitors including AROMASIN\u00ae (exemestane) tablets, for oral use; selective estrogen receptor degraders including FASLODEX\u00ae (fulvestrant) injection, for intramuscular use; and CDK 4/6 inhibitors including IBRANCE\u00ae (palbociclib) capsules, for oral use, KISQUALI\u00ae (ribociclib) tablets, for oral use, and VERZENIO\u00ae (abemaciclib). Chemotherapy agents used for the treatment of advanced breast cancer include the taxanes TAXOL\u00ae (paclitaxel), TAXOTERE\u00ae (docetaxel), ABRAXANE\u00ae (albumin-bound paclitaxel), ADRIAMYCIN\u00ae (doxorubicin hydrochloride) injection, solution for intravenous use, ELLENCE\u00ae (epirubicin hydrochloride) injection, solution for intravenous use, capecitabine, CYTOXAN\u00ae (cyclophosphamide) capsules, for oral use and PARAPLATIN\u00ae (carboplatin).\nZuclomiphene is under development for the treatment of moderate to severe hot flashes in men with advanced prostate cancer on androgen deprivation therapy. Although there are no FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of hot flashes in men who have advanced prostate cancer as a side effect of prostate cancer hormone therapies, there are several drugs being used off-label, including steroidal estrogens and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants including EFFEXOR\u00ae (venlafaxine) capsules, for oral use and anticonvulsants like NEURONTIN\u00ae (gabapentin) capsules, for oral use or tablets, for oral use which could be competitive with our zuclomiphene citrate drug candidate for the treatment of hot flashes in men who have advanced prostate cancer as a side effect of prostate cancer hormone therapies.\nENTADFI\u2122 is approved for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of BPH in men with an enlarged prostate for up to 26 weeks. All drugs currently used to treat BPH symptoms are sold in tablets or capsules. These drugs include those that decrease size of the prostate, like 5 alpha reductase inhibitors which include PROSCAR\u00ae (finasteride) and AVODART\u00ae (dutasteride). The other major class of drugs treat BPH by relaxing the smooth muscles of the prostate and bladder neck and include alpha blockers like FLOMAX\u00ae (tamsulosin HCI), HYTRIN\u00ae (terazosin), UROXATRAL\u00ae (alfuzosin), CARDURA\u00ae (doxazosin), and RAPAFLO\u00ae (silodosin) as well as Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors like CIALIS \u00ae (tadalafil). One class of drugs combines a drug that shrinks and another that relaxes the prostate called JALYN\u00ae (dutasteride/tamsulosin combination).\nAvailable Information\nThe Company maintains a corporate website for investors at https://verupharma.com/investors/ and it makes available, free of charge, through this website its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports that the Company files with or furnishes to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the SEC.

The following summary highlights some of the risks you should consider with respect to our business and prospects. This summary is not complete and the risks summarized below are not the only risks we face. For a more complete understanding of the risks related to our business and an investment in our common stock, we encourage you to read and consider the more detailed discussion of these highlighted risks, which discussion immediately follows this summary. A summary of the material risks that may affect our business, operating results and financial condition include, but are not necessarily limited to, those relating to:\nRisks Related to the Regulation and Commercialization of Our Products and Drug Candidates\n\uf0b7We have limited experience in obtaining regulatory approval or emergency use authorization for a drug.\n\uf0b7We could experience delays in our planned clinical trials.\n\uf0b7Our clinical trials may be suspended or discontinued.\n\uf0b7We may be subject to risks relating to collaboration with third parties.\n\uf0b7We intend to rely on CROs to conduct our research and development activities.\n\uf0b7We expect to rely on third party manufacturers for our drug candidates and we rely on third party manufacturers for our marketed products.\n\uf0b7Disruptions to or significantly increased costs associated with transportation and other distribution channels for our products may adversely affect our margins and profitability.\n\uf0b7Changes in law could have a negative effect on the approval of our drug candidates.\n\uf0b7We may fail or elect not to commercialize our drug candidates or our approved or authorized products.\n\uf0b7Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we may find it difficult to effectively recruit new clinical trial patients in a timely manner and to partner with clinical trial investigators and sites, which could delay or prevent us from proceeding with, or otherwise adversely affect, clinical trials of our drug candidates.\n\uf0b7Disruptions at the FDA caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could delay or prevent new drugs from being developed, approved or commercialized in a timely manner or at all, or otherwise prevent the FDA from performing normal business functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business.\n\uf0b7Our pursuit of a COVID-19 treatment candidate is still at the investigational stage. We may be unable to produce a drug that successfully treats the COVID-19 virus in a timely manner, if at all.\n\uf0b7Government entities may take actions that directly or indirectly have the effect of limiting opportunities for sabizabulin as a COVID-19 treatment.\n\uf0b7We may be unable to obtain an emergency use authorization from the FDA to market sabizabulin as a potential treatment for COVID-19 in the United States in a timely manner, if at all, or from any other regulatory authority for any other region or country.\n\uf0b7We may be unable to obtain emergency authorizations or approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries to market sabizabulin as a potential treatment for COVID-19 in a timely manner, if at all.\n\uf0b7If we are unable to manufacture sabizabulin as a COVID-19 treatment in sufficient quantities, at sufficient yields or are unable to obtain regulatory approvals for a manufacturing facility for sabizabulin, we may experience delays in product development, regulatory approval and commercial distribution.\n\uf0b7We may face competition in connection with sabizabulin for a COVID-19 treatment, if authorized.\n\uf0b7Our ability to produce a treatment for the COVID-19 virus may be curtailed by government actions or interventions, which may be more likely during a global health crisis such as COVID-19.\n\uf0b7We may need to seek and secure significant funding through financings or from other sources to effectively commercialize sabizabulin as a treatment for COVID-19.\n\uf0b7We are subject to extensive and costly governmental regulation, including healthcare reform measures that may negatively impact sales of FC2, ENTADFI and, if an EUA is obtained, sabizabulin as a treatment for COVID-19.\n\uf0b7We could experience misconduct by our employees.\n\uf0b7Coverage and reimbursement may not be available for our products.\n\uf0b7We may not be able to gain or retain market acceptance for our drug candidates.\n\uf0b7Our drug products may be subject to governmental pricing controls.\n\uf0b7Third parties may obtain FDA regulatory exclusivity to our detriment.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Capital\n\uf0b7We have incurred net losses in recent fiscal years and expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future.\n\uf0b7Additional financing may be needed to support our development and commercialization activities.\n\uf0b7COVID-19 and its impact on the economic environment and capital markets could adversely affect our access to capital when needed.\n\uf0b7If we fail to obtain additional capital, we may need to reduce the scope of our development or commercialization programs or we could be forced to share our rights to technologies with third parties on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\uf0b7The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted, and may continue to disrupt, our operations and the operations of our suppliers and customers.\n\uf0b7Our FC2 business may be affected by contracting risks with government and other international health agencies.\n\uf0b7The FDA issued a final order reclassifying female condoms as Class II medical devices, which may result in increased competition for FC2 in the U.S. market.\n\uf0b7We may experience competition, especially for sabizabulin as a treatment for COVID-19, if authorized, ENTADFI, and FC2.\n\uf0b7We may not be able to successfully implement our strategy to grow sales of FC2 or ENTADFI in the U.S. market or, if authorized, sabizabulin in the U.S. or any foreign market.\n\uf0b7We may not be able to sustain price levels for FC2 in the U.S. market.\n\uf0b7An inability to identify or complete future acquisitions could adversely affect our future growth.\n\uf0b7We may experience difficulties in integrating strategic acquisitions.\n\uf0b7We depend on two major customers for a significant portion of our net revenues.\n\uf0b7Since we sell FC2 in foreign markets, we are subject to international business risks that could adversely affect our operating results.\n\uf0b7Increases in the cost of raw materials, labor, and other costs used to manufacture FC2 could increase our cost of sales and reduce our gross margins.\n\uf0b7Currency exchange rate fluctuations could increase our expenses.\n\uf0b7We rely on a single facility to manufacture FC2, which subjects us to the risk of supply disruptions.\n\uf0b7Uncertainty and adverse changes in the general economic conditions may negatively affect our business.\n\uf0b7Material adverse or unforeseen legal judgments, fines, penalties, or settlements could have an adverse impact on our profits and cash flows.\n\uf0b7Our business and operations would suffer if we sustain cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches.\n\uf0b7Any failure to comply with the FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdiction could materially adversely affect our business and result in civil and/or criminal sanctions.\n\uf0b7We will need to increase the size and complexity of our organization in the future, and we may experience difficulties in executing our growth strategy and managing any growth.\n\uf0b7Uncertainties in the interpretation and application of tax rules in the various jurisdictions in which we operate could materially affect our deferred tax assets, tax obligations and effective tax rate.\n\uf0b7Our effective tax rate may be negatively impacted if we are unable to realize deferred tax assets or by future changes to tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate.\n\uf0b7Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\n\u200e\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property\n\uf0b7We may be unable to protect the proprietary nature of the intellectual property covering our products.\n\uf0b7Our or our licensors patents may expire or be invalidated, found to be unenforceable, narrowed or otherwise limited or our or our licensors patent applications may not result in issued patents or may result in patents with narrow, overbroad, or unenforceable claims.\n\uf0b7We are dependent in part on some license relationships.\n\uf0b7We may face claims that our intellectual property infringes on the intellectual property rights of third parties. If we infringe intellectual property rights of third parties, it may increase our costs or prevent us from being able to commercialize our product candidates.\n\uf0b7We must submit patent certifications in connection with the 505(b)(2) FDA regulatory pathway.\n\uf0b7We may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our competitors.\n\uf0b7We may need to file lawsuits or take other actions to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights.\n\uf0b7We may fail to protect the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\n\uf0b7Ownership in our common stock is highly concentrated and your ability to influence corporate matters may be limited as a result.\n\uf0b7We incurred a charge to earnings in fiscal 2020 resulting from the APP Acquisition, and additional charges to earnings resulting from the APP Acquisition in the future may cause our operating results to suffer.\n\uf0b7If we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\n\uf0b7We are a smaller reporting company and will be able to avail ourselves of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\n\uf0b7There are provisions in our charter documents, Wisconsin law and our residual royalty agreement that might prevent or delay a change in control of our company.\n\uf0b7The trading price of our common stock has been volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience substantial losses.\n\uf0b7If our stock price declines, our common stock may be subject to delisting from the NASDAQ Capital Market.\n\uf0b7A substantial number of shares may be sold in the market, which may depress the market price for our common stock.\n\uf0b7Because we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be our shareholders sole source of gain.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report and our other SEC filings, in considering our business and prospects. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected. In such cases, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Related to the Regulation and Commercialization of Our Products and Drug Candidates\nWe have limited experience in obtaining regulatory approval or emergency use authorization for a drug.\nWe have only obtained regulatory approval for one of our drugs under development, ENTADFI (tadalafil and finasteride) capsules, for oral use. We have never obtained an EUA in the U.S. or in any other jurisdiction. It is possible that the FDA or other regulatory authorities may refuse to accept any or all of our EUAs or planned NDAs for substantive review or may conclude, after review of our data, that our applications are insufficient to obtain regulatory authorization or approval of any of our drug candidates, including sabizabulin for the treatment of certain hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The FDA may also require that we conduct additional clinical or manufacturing validation studies, which may be costly and time-consuming, and submit that data before it will reconsider our applications. Depending on the extent of these or any other FDA required studies, approval of any NDA or authorization of any EUA application, including that for sabizabulin, that we submit may be significantly delayed, possibly for years, or may require us to expend more resources than we have available or can secure. Any delay or inability in obtaining regulatory approvals would delay or prevent us from commercializing our drug candidates, generating revenue from these proposed products and achieving and sustaining profitability. It is also possible that additional studies, if performed and completed, may not be considered sufficient by the FDA to approve any NDA or any EUA, including that for sabizabulin, we submit. In addition, if the requirements for approval of any of our drug candidates under Section 505(b)(2) are not as we expect, it will likely take significantly longer, cost significantly more and be significantly more complicated to gain FDA approval for these drug candidates, and in any case may not be successful. If any of these outcomes occur, we may be forced to abandon our planned NDAs or EUAs, including that for sabizabulin, for one or more of our drug candidates, which would materially adversely affect our business.\nClinical trials involve a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process as a result of inadequate performance of a drug, inadequate adherence by patients or investigators to clinical trial protocols or other factors. New drugs in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through earlier clinical trials. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials as a result of a lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, despite promising results in earlier trials. Our future clinical trials may not be successful or may be more expensive or time-consuming than we currently expect. If clinical trials for any of our drug candidates fail to demonstrate safety or efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA, the FDA will not approve that drug and we would not be able to commercialize it, which will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe could experience delays in our planned clinical trials.\nWe may experience delays in any of the clinical trials that will be required to be conducted for our drug candidates. Our planned clinical trials might not begin on time; may be interrupted, delayed, suspended, or terminated once commenced; might need to be redesigned; might not enroll a sufficient number of patients; or might not be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including the following:\n\uf0b7delays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\uf0b7imposition of a clinical hold following an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\uf0b7imposition of a clinical hold because of safety or efficacy concerns by the FDA, a DSMB or IDMC, a clinical trial site's IRB or us;\n\uf0b7delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations (CROs) and clinical trial sites;\n\uf0b7delays in obtaining required IRB approval at each site;\n\uf0b7delays in identifying, recruiting and training suitable clinical investigators;\n\uf0b7delays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\uf0b7delays in having patients complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\uf0b7clinical sites dropping out of a trial to the detriment of enrollment;\n\uf0b7time required to add new sites;\n\uf0b7delays in obtaining sufficient supplies of clinical trial materials, including suitable active pharmaceutical ingredients;\n\uf0b7delays resulting from negative or equivocal findings of DSMB or IDMC for a trial; or\n\uf0b7delays resulting from shutdowns or quarantines or staffing shortages relating to COVID-19 or other reasons.\nPatient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors, including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, competing clinical trials, and clinicians' and patients' perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating. Any of these delays in completing our clinical trials could increase our costs, slow down our product development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue as to the affected drug candidate.\nOur clinical trials may be suspended or discontinued.\nBefore we can obtain regulatory approval for the commercial sale of our drug candidates, we may be required to complete preclinical development with respect to such drug candidates and/or extensive clinical trials in humans to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the drug candidates. To date, regulatory approval has not been obtained for any of our drug candidates.\nUnfavorable results from preclinical studies or clinical trials could result in delays, modifications or abandonment of ongoing or future clinical trials. Clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals. Negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause a clinical trial to be delayed, repeated or terminated. In addition, we may report top-line data from time to time, which is based on a preliminary analysis of key efficacy and safety data. Such top-line data may be subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the applicable clinical trial. If we delay or abandon our development efforts related to any of our drug candidates, we would experience potentially significant delays in, or be required to abandon, development of that drug candidate. If we delay or abandon our development efforts related to any of our drug candidates, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially adversely affected.\nOur clinical trials may be suspended or terminated at any time for a number of reasons. A clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, our collaborators, the FDA or other regulatory authorities because of a failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, presentation of unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using the investigational drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions, lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial or negative or equivocal findings of the DSMB, IDMC or the IRB for a clinical trial. An IRB may also suspend or terminate our clinical trials for failure to protect patient safety or patient rights. We may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials if at any time we believe that they present an unacceptable risk to participants. In addition, regulatory agencies may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials at any time if they believe the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or present an unacceptable safety risk to participants. If we elect or are forced to suspend or terminate any clinical trial of any drug candidate we are developing, the commercial prospects of such drug candidate will be harmed and our ability to generate revenue from such drug candidate will be delayed or eliminated. Any of these occurrences may materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may be subject to risks relating to collaboration with third parties.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may enter into collaboration arrangements with strategic partners to develop and commercialize our drug candidates or to develop companion diagnostics for our drug candidates. For our collaboration efforts to be successful, we must identify partners whose competencies complement our competencies. We may be unsuccessful in entering into collaboration agreements with acceptable partners or negotiating favorable terms in these agreements. Also, we may be unsuccessful in integrating the resources and capabilities of these collaborators with our own. In addition, we may face a disadvantage in seeking to enter into or negotiating collaborations with potential partners because other potential collaborators may have greater management and financial resources than we do. Our collaborators may prove difficult to work with or less skilled than originally expected or may require more time to achieve the planned goals of any such collaboration, if they are achieved at all. For companion diagnostics, any such collaborator may be unsuccessful in obtaining regulatory approval for the planned diagnostic and, even if approved, may not be successful in commercializing the diagnostic or achieving widespread adoption of the diagnostic by physicians. If we are unsuccessful in our collaborative efforts, our ability to develop and market drug candidates could be severely limited.\nWe intend to rely on CROs to conduct our research and development activities.\nWe do not have the resources to independently conduct research and development activities. Therefore, we intend to and do rely on CROs to conduct research and development activities for our drug candidates and for the execution of our clinical studies. Although we will control only certain aspects of our CROs' activities, we will be responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We cannot be sure that the CROs will conduct the research properly in a timely manner or on a cost-effective basis, or that the results will be reproducible. We and our CROs are required to comply with the FDA's cGCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA for all of our drug products in clinical development. The FDA enforces these cGCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites. If we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable or invalid and the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our drug candidates. In addition, to evaluate the safety and effectiveness compared to placebo of our drug candidates to a statistically significant degree, our clinical trials will require an adequately large number of test subjects. Any clinical trial that a CRO conducts abroad on our behalf is subject to similar regulation. Accordingly, if our CROs fail to comply with these regulations or recruit a sufficient number of patients, we may be required to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nIn addition, we will not employ the personnel of our CROs, and, except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such organizations, we cannot control whether or not they will devote sufficient time and resources to our research and development and our clinical studies. Our CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including one or more of our competitors, for which they may also be conducting clinical studies or other drug development activities, which could impede their ability to devote appropriate time to our clinical programs. If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised because of the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements, or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our drug candidates that we seeks to develop. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our drug candidates that we seek to develop would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenue from such drug candidates could be delayed or ended.\nIf any of our relationships with these third parties terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or entering into new relationships with CROs involves substantial cost and requires extensive management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays occur, which can materially affect our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines and can increase our costs significantly. We may encounter challenges or delays in entering into or maintaining these relationships, and any such delays or challenges may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe expect to rely on third party manufacturers for our drug candidates and we rely on third party manufacturers for our marketed products.\nFor the foreseeable future, we expect to and do rely on third-party manufacturers and other third parties to produce, package and store sufficient quantities of drug candidates for use in our clinical trials and, in the case of ENTADFI and sabizabulin, if authorized, sufficient to meet demand. These drug candidates and products are complicated and expensive to manufacture. If our third-party manufacturers fail to deliver our drug candidates for clinical use on a timely basis, with sufficient quality, and at commercially reasonable prices, we may be required to delay or suspend clinical trials or otherwise discontinue development and production of our drug candidates. While we may be able to identify replacement third-party manufacturers or develop our own manufacturing capabilities for these drug candidates or products, this process would likely cause a delay in the availability of our drug candidates or products and an increase in costs. In addition, third-party manufacturers may have a limited number of facilities in which our drug candidates or products can be produced, and any interruption of the operation of those facilities due to events such as equipment malfunction or failure or damage to the facility by natural disasters could result in the cancellation of shipments, loss of product in the manufacturing process or a shortfall in available drug candidates or products.\nIn addition, regulatory requirements could pose barriers to the manufacture of our drug candidates or marketed products. Third-party manufacturers are required to comply with the FDA's cGMPs. As a result, the facilities used by any manufacturers of our drug candidates and marketed products must maintain a compliance status acceptable to the FDA. Holders of NDAs, or other forms of FDA approvals or clearances, or those distributing a regulated product under their own name, are responsible for manufacturing even though that manufacturing is conducted by a third-party contract manufacturing organization (CMO). Our third-party manufacturers will be required to produce our drug candidates and marketed products under FDA cGMPs in order to meet acceptable standards. Our third-party manufacturers may not perform their obligations under their agreements with us or may discontinue their business before the time required by us to gain approval for or commercialize our drug candidates. In addition, our manufacturers will be subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies for compliance with cGMPs and similar regulatory requirements. Failure by any of our manufacturers to comply with applicable cGMPs could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspensions or withdrawals of approvals, operating restrictions, interruptions in supply, recalls, withdrawals, issuance of safety alerts and criminal prosecutions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Finally, we also could experience manufacturing delays if our CMOs give greater priority to the supply of other products over our products or otherwise do not satisfactorily perform according to the terms of their agreements with us.\nIf any supplier for our drug candidates or marketed products experiences any significant difficulties in its manufacturing processes, does not comply with the terms of the agreement between us or does not devote sufficient time, energy and care to providing our manufacturing needs, we could experience significant interruptions in the supply of our drug candidates or marketed products, which could impair our ability to supply our drug candidates at the levels required for our clinical trials or commercialization and prevent or delay their successful development and commercialization.\nDisruptions to or significantly increased costs associated with transportation and other distribution channels for our products may adversely affect our margins and profitability.\nWe expect to rely on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of third-party logistics companies to transport and deliver our products, including sabizabulin, if authorized, ENTADFI and FC2. These third-party logistics companies may experience disruptions to the transportation channels used to distribute our products, including disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, increased airport and shipping port congestion, a lack of transportation capacity, increased fuel expenses, and a shortage of manpower or capital or due to other business interruptions. Disruptions to the transportation channels experienced by our third-party logistics companies may result in increased costs, including the additional use of airfreight to meet demand. Disruptions to this business model or our relationship with the third party if, for example, performance fails to meet our expectations, could harm our business.\nChanges in law could have a negative impact on the approval of our drug candidates.\nThe FDA has established regulations, guidelines and policies to govern the drug development and approval process, as have foreign regulatory authorities. Any change in regulatory requirements resulting from the adoption of new legislation, regulations or policies may require us to amend existing clinical trial protocols or add new clinical trials to comply with these changes. Such amendments to existing protocols or clinical trial applications or the need for new ones, may significantly and adversely affect the cost, timing and completion of the clinical trials for our drug candidates. In addition, the FDA's policies may change and additional government regulations may be issued that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our drug candidates, or impose more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. The political environment in the U.S. could result in significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation and government policy that could significantly impact our business and the health care industry. While it is not possible to predict whether and when any such changes will occur, specific proposals that have been discussed or implemented which could have a material impact on us include, but are not limited to, potential changes to the ACA, recently issued regulations offering employers religious and moral exemptions from the ACAs requirement to provide insurance covering birth control, and the enactment of the 21st Century Cures Act. If we are slow or unable to adapt to any such changes, our business, prospects and ability to achieve or sustain profitability would be adversely affected.\nWe may fail or elect not to commercialize our drug candidates or our approved or authorized products.\nWe cannot be sure that, if our clinical trials for any of our drug candidates are successfully completed, we will be able to submit an NDA to the FDA or that any NDA we submit will be approved by the FDA in a timely manner, if at all, or that the submission of any NDA is commercially feasible. Similar risks apply to our Emergency Use Authorization applications in the U.S. and other jurisdictions for sabizabulin for certain hospitalized COVID-19 patients. After completing clinical trials for a drug candidate in humans, a drug dossier is prepared and submitted to the FDA as an NDA, and includes all preclinical studies and clinical trial data relevant to the safety and effectiveness of the product at the suggested dose and duration of use for the proposed indication as well as manufacturing information, in order to allow the FDA to review such drug dossier and to consider a drug candidate for approval for commercialization in the United States. If we are unable to submit an NDA with respect to any of our current drug candidates, if any NDA we submit is not approved by the FDA, or we elect not to file an NDA, or if we are unable to obtain any required state and local distribution licenses or similar authorizations, we will be unable to commercialize that product. The FDA can and does reject NDAs and require additional clinical trials, even when drug candidates achieve favorable results in Phase 3 clinical trials.\nSimilarly, we may not successfully commercialize our approved or authorized product, ENTADFI, or we may not receive authorization to commercialize sabizabulin. We or our collaboration partners in any potential commercial marketing efforts of ENTADFI or sabizabulin, if authorized, may not be successful in achieving widespread patient or physician awareness or acceptance of these products. Also, we may be subject to pricing pressures from competitive products or from governmental or commercial payors or regulatory bodies that could make it difficult or impossible for us to commercialize ENTADFI or sabizabulin, if authorized, successfully. Any failure to commercialize our marketed drugs could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and our business.\nIf we fail to commercialize any of these drug candidates, or approved or authorized products, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially adversely affected and our reputation in the industry and in the investment community would likely be damaged.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, we may find it difficult to effectively recruit new clinical trial patients in a timely manner and to partner with clinical trial investigators and sites, which could delay or prevent us from proceeding with, or otherwise adversely affect, clinical trials of our drug candidates.\nIdentifying and qualifying patients to participate in, and partnering with investigators and sites to run, clinical trials of our drug candidates is critical to the timely completion of our clinical trials. Patients may be unwilling to participate in our clinical trials because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The severe burden on healthcare systems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has also impaired the ability of many research sites to start new clinical trials or to enroll new patients in clinical trials. The imposed mandatory sheltering in place and social distancing restrictions may delay the recruitment of patients and impede their ability to effectively participate in such trials. Significant fees may also be owed to contract research organizations associated with starting and stopping clinical trials, typically more so than delaying the start of a clinical trial.\nThere is a risk that changing circumstances relating to the COVID-19 pandemic may not allow our healthcare clinical trial investigators, their healthcare facilities or other necessary parties to continue to participate in our clinical trials through completion or may delay the initiation of planned clinical trials. Any delays related to clinical trials could result in increased costs, delays in advancing our drug candidates, delays in testing the effectiveness of our drug candidates or termination of the clinical trials altogether.\nDisruptions at the FDA caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could delay or prevent new drugs from being developed, approved or commercialized in a timely manner or at all, or otherwise prevent the FDA from performing normal business functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business.\nDisruptions at the FDA caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved, which would adversely affect our business. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 10, 2020 the FDA announced its intention to postpone most inspections of foreign manufacturing facilities and products through April 2020. On March 18, 2020, the FDA announced its intention to temporarily postpone routine surveillance inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities. The FDA has also prioritized the review of submissions relating to COVID-19. The FDA may adopt other restrictions or policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic or issue guidance materially affecting the conduct of clinical trials. If global health concerns continue to prevent the FDA from conducting its regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur pursuit of a COVID-19 treatment candidate is still at the investigational stage. We may be unable to produce a drug that successfully treats the virus in a timely manner, if at all.\nWe filed an application for an Emergency Use Authorization for sabizabulin for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with moderate or severe risk of ARDS in June 2022 after announcing positive interim phase 3 clinical data. The FDA has not yet authorized, and may never authorize, our EUA for sabizabulin or the FDA may require additional studies as a condition of any authorization that we do not believe are commercially reasonable to undertake which may lead to FDA refusal of our EUA. Similarly, we have filed applications for emergency use or other similar expedited regulatory pathways in certain jurisdictions outside the U.S., including the United Kingdom, the European Union, Australia, Switzerland, South Korea, and Canada, and similar risks apply to those applications. Moreover, any authorization by the FDA or any other regulatory authority may have significant restrictions or conditions that hamper our ability to effectively market sabizabulin or any such authorization may come late enough in the COVID-19 pandemic that our ability to market sabizabulin effectively or for a sufficient period of time may be negatively affected. Our development of a COVID-19 treatment is still at the investigational stages, and we may be unable to produce a drug that successfully treats the virus in a timely manner, if at all. We are also committing financial resources and personnel to the development of a COVID-19 treatment which may cause delays in or otherwise negatively impact our other development programs, despite uncertainties surrounding the longevity and extent of coronavirus as a global health concern. We have expended considerable resources in scaling-up manufacturing of sabizabulin so that we might be ready to meet potential demand in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world, if sabizabulin receives any authorization, but, if we do not receive any authorization, we may have to write-off stock of sabizabulin if we are not able to redirect it before applicable expiration dates. In addition, if we do not receive any such authorization, we may have to unwind certain business arrangements into which we have entered in building up our commercialization infrastructure and such efforts may result in significant contractual, severance, or other costs. Our business could be negatively impacted by our allocation of significant resources to a global health threat that is unpredictable and could rapidly dissipate or against which our treatment, if developed, may not be partially or fully effective or by drug products to treat COVID-19 being developed by other companies that receive approval. In addition, conducting a clinical trial of a COVID-19 treatment is challenging in the current environment due to a number of factors, including a large number of competitive clinical trials seeking to enroll COVID-19 patients, the high workload of hospital staff, and the difficulty of enrolling patients in intensive care or similar environments. These challenges may delay any clinical trial, increase its costs or otherwise adversely affect any such clinical trial.\nGovernment entities may take actions that directly or indirectly have the effect of limiting opportunities for sabizabulin as a COVID-19 treatment.\nVarious government entities, including the U.S. government, are offering incentives, grants and contracts to encourage additional investment by commercial organizations into preventative and therapeutic agents against COVID-19, which may have the effect of increasing the number of competitors and/or providing advantages to competitors. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully establish a competitive market share if we develop a COVID-19 treatment. COVID-19 treatments may also be subject to government pricing controls, which could adversely affect the profitability of any COVID-19 treatment we are able to develop and commercialize.\nWe may be unable to obtain an emergency use authorization from the FDA to market sabizabulin as a potential treatment for COVID-19 in the United States in a timely manner, if at all, or from any other regulatory authority for any other region or country.\nIn response to the global outbreak of COVID-19, we have been pursuing the development of sabizabulin as a treatment for COVID-19. Our ability to commercialize sabizabulin as a treatment for COVID-19 will depend on regulatory approval in the United States and other jurisdictions. In the United States, we initially plan to use the FDAs EUA process, and on June 7, 2022, the Company submitted a request for an EUA. EUA is a form of temporary marketing authorization that the FDA may grant to an investigational drug at times when the Secretary of Health and Human Services has declared a public health emergency to exist. This declaration was made by the Secretary of Health and Human Services in March 2020 in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to grant an EUA, the FDA must determine that an investigational drug is likely safe and likely effective in treating the disease that is the subject of the public health emergency. Although the EUA process is designed to enable more expeditious marketing of a drug in response to a public health emergency, FDA review of an EUA application may take longer than expected and may result in the FDA requesting additional data or other information that may have the effect of delaying the EUA, and any agreements or positions taken by the FDA in a pre-EUA meeting does not bind the FDA or prevent it from later taking a different position, asking for more data, or delaying or denying the application. The FDA may decline to grant an EUA if it concludes that an investigational drug is not safe or effective. If any such issues arise in connection with our submission of an EUA for sabizabulin, our ability to market sabizabulin as a COVID-19 treatment may delayed or dependent on a more time-consuming regulatory approval process, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. If we are granted an EUA by the FDA for sabizabulin, we would be able to distribute sabizabulin under the conditions set forth in the EUA prior to FDA approval. Furthermore, the FDA may revoke (or refuse to grant) an EUA where it is determined that the underlying health emergency no longer exists or warrants such authorization, and we cannot predict how long, if ever, an EUA would remain in place. Such revocation could adversely impact our business in a variety of ways, including if sabizabulin is not yet approved by the FDA and if we and our manufacturing partners have invested in the supply chain to provide sabizabulin under an EUA. Similar risks apply to all of our efforts to obtain emergency authorization or other similar expedited regulatory authorization in other countries around the world, including the United Kingdom, the European Union, Australia, Switzerland, South Korea, and Canada.\nWe may be unable to obtain emergency authorizations or approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries to market sabizabulin as a potential treatment for COVID-19 in a timely manner, if at all.\nSimilar to the regulatory challenges we face for an EUA or approval of sabizabulin for the treatment of COVID-19 in the United States, we will not be able to market sabizabulin for the treatment of COVID-19 in any foreign jurisdiction without an applicable authorization or approval in any such foreign jurisdiction. We have never received any such authorization or approval for any of our drug candidates from any foreign regulatory authority and, even if such an authorization or approval is granted, we have no experience marketing a drug outside the United States. Like any EUA or approval in the United States, any authorization or approval outside the United States may be subject to various conditions required by any such foreign regulatory authority. There can be no assurances of the timing of receipt of any such foreign authorization or approval or whether we will receive any such foreign authorization or approval at all and, if we do receive any such authorization or approval, whether we will be able to market sabizabulin on favorable economic terms.\nWe lack experience in scaling-up and commercializing a drug product.\nWe are working toward the large-scale technical development, manufacturing scale-up and larger scale deployment of sabizabulin as a COVID-19 treatment. To support the scale-up, we have expended and will need to continue to expend significant resources and capital. In connection with this process, we may seek to enter into a collaboration or other arrangement with a larger organization, although we may be unable to enter into such arrangements on favorable terms, or at all, or may decide to proceed with development and commercialization on our own. In that case, we will need to expend significant resources to commercialize sabizabulin, which may require additional financial resources.\nIn addition, since the path to licensure or emergency approval of any COVID-19 treatment remains uncertain, we may have a widely used drug in circulation in the United States or another country prior to our receipt of marketing approval. Unexpected safety issues, including any that we have not yet observed in our clinical trials for sabizabulin, could lead to significant reputational damage for us and our drug development program going forward and other issues, including delays in our other programs, the need for re-design of our clinical trials and the need for significant additional financial resources.\nIf we are unable to manufacture sabizabulin as a COVID-19 treatment in sufficient quantities, at sufficient yields or are unable to obtain regulatory approvals for a manufacturing facility for sabizabulin, we may experience delays in product development, regulatory approval and commercial distribution.\nIf we are authorized to market sabizabulin as a COVID-19 treatment, its commercialization will require access to facilities to manufacture sabizabulin at sufficient yields and at commercial scale. We have no experience in manufacturing any of our drug candidates in the volumes that would be necessary to support commercial sales. Efforts to establish these capabilities may not meet initial expectations as to scheduling, scale-up, reproducibility, yield, purity, cost, potency or quality. In addition, other companies, many with substantial resources, may compete with us for access to materials needed to manufacture sabizabulin.\nManufacturing sabizabulin as a COVID-19 treatment will involve a complicated process with which we have limited experience. We are dependent on third-party organizations to conduct our manufacturing activities. If third-party manufacturing organizations are unable to manufacture sabizabulin in commercial quantities and at sufficient yields, then we will need to identify and reach supply arrangements with additional third parties. Third-party manufacturers must also be inspected by the FDA as part of the FDAs review of our marketing application. Sabizabulin may be in competition with other products for access to these facilities and may be subject to delays in manufacturing if third parties give other products higher priority. We may not be able to enter into any necessary additional third-party manufacturing arrangements on acceptable terms, or on a timely basis. In addition, we have to enter into technical transfer agreements and share our know-how with the third-party manufacturers, which can be time-consuming and may result in delays. Any delay in the manufacture or delivery of sabizabulin could adversely affect our ability to sell sabizabulin as a COVID-19 treatment, if approved.\nOur reliance on third-party manufacturers may adversely affect our operations or result in unforeseen delays or other problems beyond our control. Because of contractual restraints and the limited number of third-party manufacturers with the expertise, required regulatory approvals and facilities to manufacture sabizabulin on a commercial scale, replacement of a manufacturer may be expensive and time-consuming and may cause interruptions in the production of sabizabulin. A third-party manufacturer may also encounter difficulties in production. These problems may include:\n\uf0b7difficulties with production costs, scale up and yields;\n\uf0b7availability of raw materials and supplies;\n\uf0b7quality control and assurance;\n\uf0b7shortages of qualified personnel;\n\uf0b7compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations that vary in each country where products might be sold; and\n\uf0b7lack of capital funding.\nAs a result, any delay or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe may face competition in connection with sabizabulin for a COVID-19 treatment, if authorized.\nAnother party may be successful in producing a more efficacious, an earlier-stage, or a less expensive treatment for COVID-19 which may also lead to the diversion of governmental and quasi-governmental funding as well as government or commercial payor reimbursements away from us and toward other companies. In particular, given the widespread media attention on the current COVID-19 pandemic, there are efforts by public and private entities to develop COVID-19 treatments. Those other entities may develop COVID-19 treatments that, as compared to sabizabulin, are more effective, become the standard of care, have broader market acceptance, are safer or have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient, are developed at a lower cost or earlier, or may be more successfully commercialized. Many of these other organizations are much larger than we are and have access to larger pools of capital and broader manufacturing infrastructure. Larger pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have extensive experience in clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval for their products, and may have the resources to heavily invest to accelerate discovery and development of their vaccine candidates. Our business could be materially and adversely affected if competitors develop and commercialize one or more COVID-19 treatments before we can complete development and seek approval for sabizabulin.\nOur ability to produce a treatment for the COVID-19 virus may be curtailed by government actions or interventions, which may be more likely during a global health crisis such as COVID-19.\nGiven the significant global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that one or more government entities may take actions that directly or indirectly have the effect of diminishing some of our rights or opportunities with respect to sabizabulin and the economic value of a COVID-19 treatment to us could be limited. Governments and other health authorities may also focus on vaccines rather than treatment options such as sabizabulin in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, which may reduce funding and other market opportunities for sabizabulin. We also intend to seek to enter into contracts with foreign health authorities to supply sabizabulin, which will depend on spending and political priorities, the availability of alternative treatment options, and the continuation of the COVID-19 as a public health emergency. Government entities may also impose restrictions or limitations on our third-party service providers and may require us to obtain alternative sources for sabizabulin. If we are unable to timely enter into alternative arrangements, or if such alternative arrangements are not available on satisfactory terms, we will experience delays in the development or production of our sabizabulin, increased expenses, and delays in potential distribution or commercialization of sabizabulin, if authorized.\nWe may need to seek and secure significant funding through financings or from other sources to effectively commercialize sabizabulin as a treatment for COVID-19.\nWe are currently advancing our pipeline of prostate and breast cancer drug candidates and are conducting multiple clinical studies, and we plan to initiate additional studies in infectious diseases. Discovering development candidates and developing investigational medicines is expensive, and we expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to (i) perform basic research, perform preclinical studies, and conduct clinical trials of our current and future programs, (ii) continue to develop and expand our platform and infrastructure and supply preclinical studies and clinical trials with appropriate grade materials (including cGMP materials), (iii) seek regulatory approvals for our investigational medicines, and (iv) launch and commercialize any products for which we receive regulatory approval, including building our own commercial sales, marketing, and distribution organization. Furthermore, our ongoing work on sabizabulin will require significant additional investment during 2023 and beyond.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had approximately $80.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our current planned operations through at least the next twelve months. However, our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, including with respect to our development, manufacturing, ability to obtain authorization to distribute, and commercialization of sabizabulin for COVID-19 and availability and conditions of advanced purchase agreements, if any, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings, structured financings, government or other third-party funding, sales of assets, marketing and distribution arrangements, other collaborations and licensing arrangements, or a combination of these approaches. Even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans, we may seek additional capital if market conditions are favorable or if we have specific strategic considerations. Our spending will vary based on new and ongoing development and corporate activities. Because the length of time and activities associated with discovery of development candidates and development of our investigational medicines are highly uncertain, we are unable to estimate the actual funds we will require for development, marketing, and commercialization activities.\nWe are subject to extensive and costly governmental regulation, including healthcare reform measures that may negatively impact sales of FC2, ENTADFI and, if an EUA is obtained, sabizabulin as a treatment for COVID-19.\nOur marketed products, ENTADFI and FC2, and our drug candidates, including sabizabulin as a treatment for COVID-19, are subject to extensive and rigorous domestic government regulation, including regulation by the FDA, the FTC, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, including its Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, to the extent our products are paid for directly or indirectly by those departments, state and local governments and their respective foreign equivalents. The FDA regulates the research, development, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, record keeping, reporting, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution, import and export of pharmaceutical products and medical devices under various regulatory provisions. The Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP) division of the FDA also regulates the advertising, marketing, and promotion of the Companys products. Many states and local governments require distribution licenses or similar authorizations to sell products in their jurisdictions. Any of our products that are tested or marketed outside the U.S. are also subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments, whether or not we have obtained FDA approval for a given product and its uses. Such foreign regulation may be equally or more demanding than corresponding U.S. regulation.\nThe ACA mandates coverage of FC2 by U.S. health insurance plans. The ACA is periodically subject to legal challenges and a continuing political effort to limit its scope or even potentially repeal it. We do not expect any imminent such modifications or repeal under the Biden Administration, but we can offer no assurance that the political situation regarding the ACA will not change in ways in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our ability to commercialize FC2 as a prescription product in the U.S.\nSpecific to the contraception coverage mandate, ACA regulations provide exemptions from this requirement for qualifying religious employers and individuals and non-governmental entities that object to providing the coverage on the basis of sincerely held religious beliefs. The Trump administration issued two interim final regulations in October 2017 expanding the exemptions to those entities objecting to the requirement on the basis of religious and moral convictions, which were finalized in November 2018. Federal court judges in Pennsylvania and California separately blocked enforcements of these exemption regulations, with appellate courts upholding the decisions. On July 8, 2020, the Supreme Court reversed the lower courts rulings, allowing the rules to go into effect. Even though the U.S. Department of Labor issued a statement on January 10, 2022, reminding plans and issuers subject to these requirements of their responsibility to fully comply with the requirements under PHS Act section 2713 and the HRSA Guidelines, challenges or future regulatory efforts to erode the contraception mandate may persist. If successful, such challenges may adversely impact sales of FC2 in states that do not separately provide for reimbursement of FC2.\nMedical devices such as FC2 are cleared or approved for one or more specific intended uses and performance claims that must be adequately substantiated. Promoting a device for an off-label use or making misleading or unsubstantiated claims could result in government enforcement action. Any changes to the device, including labeling, post-clearance or approval must be assessed to determine if a new clearance or approval is required. Furthermore, the facility in which we manufacture FC2 is subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and other federal, state and foreign government authorities, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including the FDAs Quality System Regulation, which requires, among other things, periodic audits, design controls, quality control testing and documentation procedures, as well as complaint evaluations and investigation. The FDA also requires the reporting of certain adverse events and product malfunctions and may require the reporting of recalls or other correction or removals of devices in commercial distribution. Issues identified through such inspections and reports may result in FDA enforcement action. Moreover, issues identified through such inspections and reports may require significant resources to resolve.\nThe FDA may inspect our facilities periodically to determine compliance with provisions of the FDC Act and FDA regulations. The FDA also requires the reporting of certain adverse events and product malfunctions and may require the reporting of recalls or other field safety corrective actions. Issues identified through such inspections and reports may result in FDA enforcement action. Moreover, issues identified through such inspections and reports may require significant resources to resolve.\nFailure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could lead to the following actions:\n\uf0b7partial suspension or total shutdown of manufacturing;\n\uf0b7product shortages;\n\uf0b7delays in product manufacturing;\n\uf0b7FDA warning letters or other notifications of violations of law;\n\uf0b7fines or civil penalties;\n\uf0b7delays in or restrictions on obtaining new regulatory clearances or approvals;\n\uf0b7withdrawal or suspension of required clearances, approvals or licenses;\n\uf0b7product seizures or recalls;\n\uf0b7injunctions;\n\uf0b7criminal prosecution;\n\uf0b7advisories or other field actions;\n\uf0b7operating restrictions, including the inability to market a product in certain state or local jurisdictions; and\n\uf0b7prohibitions against exporting of products to, or importing products from, countries outside the U.S.\nAny of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAny of our products that are tested or marketed abroad are also subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments, whether or not we have obtained FDA approval for a given product and its uses. Such foreign regulation may be equally or more burdensome than U.S. regulation.\nWe are subject to additional health care regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include the following:\n\uf0b7the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under government health care programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\uf0b7the federal False Claims Act that prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other government health care programs that are false or fraudulent;\n\uf0b7federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters; and\n\uf0b7state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.\nIn addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made by drug and device manufacturers to health care practitioners. Some states, such as California, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Nevada, mandate implementation of corporate compliance programs, while other state laws prohibit, or require tracking and reporting of, certain gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians and other health care practitioners.\nIn recent years, a number of states, including California, Minnesota, Oregon, Texas and Washington, have enacted laws requiring manufacturers to submit reports on drugs whose list price has increased by more than a certain percentage during a specified period and/or new drugs that are being launched at a price exceeding a specified amount. Among other things, the reports must explain the justifications for the price or price increase.\nThe scope and enforcement of these laws is uncertain and subject to change in the current environment of health care reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. We cannot predict the impact on our business of any changes in these laws. Federal or state regulatory authorities may challenge our current or future activities under these laws. Any such challenge could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. Any state or federal regulatory review of us, regardless of the outcome, would be costly and time-consuming.\nWe could experience misconduct by our employees.\nWe will be exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, marketing and promotional laws, rules, and policies, to provide accurate information to the FDA, to comply with federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations, to comply with anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, to report financial information or data accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the health care industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and prevent employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nCoverage and reimbursement may not be available for our products.\nMarket acceptance and sales for our marketed products, including ENTADFI and FC2, and drug candidates, including sabizabulin as a treatment for COVID-19, will depend on coverage and reimbursement policies and may be affected by health care reform measures. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which products they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for our drug candidates, if approved. We also cannot be sure that the amount of reimbursement available, if any, will not reduce the demand for, or the price of, our products. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our drug candidates.\nWe may not be able to gain and retain market acceptance for our drug candidates.\nPhysicians may not prescribe our drug candidates, if approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities for marketing and sale, which would prevent any such drug candidate from generating revenue. Market acceptance of our marketed products, including sabizabulin, ENTADFI, and FC2, and drug candidates by physicians, patients and payors, will depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\uf0b7the clinical indications for which our drug candidates are approved, if at all;\n\uf0b7acceptance by physicians and payors of each product as safe and effective treatment;\n\uf0b7the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n\uf0b7the relative convenience and ease of administration of our products in the treatment of the conditions for which they are intended;\n\uf0b7the availability and efficacy of competitive drugs;\n\uf0b7the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts;\n\uf0b7the extent to which the product is approved for inclusion on formularies of hospitals and managed care organizations;\n\uf0b7the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third parties, such as insurance companies and other health care payors, or by government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid;\n\uf0b7limitations or warnings contained in a product's FDA or other applicable regulatory agencys approved labeling; and\n\uf0b7prevalence and severity of adverse side effects.\nEven if the medical community accepts that our drug candidates are safe and efficacious for their approved indications, physicians may not immediately be receptive to the use or may be slow to adopt such products as an accepted treatment for the conditions for which they are intended. Without head-to-head comparative data, we will also not be able to promote our products as being superior to competing products. If our drug candidates, if approved, do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians and payors, we may not generate sufficient or any revenue from these products. In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our products may require significant resources and may never be successful.\nIn addition, even if our drug candidates achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to maintain that market acceptance over time if:\n\uf0b7new products or technologies are introduced that are more favorably received than our products, are more cost effective or render our products obsolete;\n\uf0b7unforeseen complications arise with respect to use of our products; or\n\uf0b7sufficient third-party insurance coverage or reimbursement does not remain available.\nOur drug products may be subject to governmental pricing controls.\nIn many foreign markets, including the countries in the EU, pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control. In the United States, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental pricing controls. While we cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our likelihood of launching a product and on the profitability of any marketed product.\nThird parties may obtain FDA regulatory exclusivity to our detriment.\nWe plan to seek to obtain market exclusivity for our drug candidates and any other drug candidates we develop in the future. To the extent that patent protection is not available or has expired, FDA marketing exclusivity may be the only available form of exclusivity available for these proposed products. Marketing exclusivity can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. Potentially competitive products may also seek marketing exclusivity and may be in various stages of development, including some more advanced than our drug candidates. We cannot predict with certainty the timing of FDA approval or whether FDA approval will be granted, nor can we predict with certainty the timing of FDA approval for competing products or whether such approval will be granted. It is possible that competing products may obtain FDA approval with marketing exclusivity before we do, which could delay our ability to submit a marketing application or obtain necessary regulatory approvals, result in lost market opportunities with respect to our drug candidates and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Capital\nWe have incurred net losses in recent fiscal years and expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe incurred net loss of $83.8 million during the year ended September 30, 2022. Pharmaceutical product development is a speculative undertaking, involves a substantial degree of risk and is a capital-intensive business. We expect to incur significant expenses until we are able to obtain regulatory approval and subsequently sell one or more of our drug candidates under development in significant quantities, which may not happen. We expect to devote most of our financial resources to research and development, including our non-clinical development activities and clinical trials. Our drug candidates will require the completion of regulatory review, significant marketing efforts and substantial investment before they can provide us with any revenue. We are uncertain when or if we will be able to achieve or sustain profitability. If we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Failure to become and remain profitable would impair our ability to sustain operations and adversely affect the price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital.\nAdditional financing may be needed to support our development and commercialization activities.\nWe expect to incur significant expenditures over the next several years to support our preclinical and clinical development activities, particularly with respect to clinical trials for certain of our drug candidates and to commence the commercialization of our drug candidates. This may require us to obtain additional financing for our business until revenues from our current commercial operations independently fund our drug development programs. We may also need to obtain additional financing to complete the development of any additional drug candidates we might acquire or to pay other operating expenses.\nAdditional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain needed financing on acceptable terms, we may not be able to implement our business plan, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If we raise additional funds through the sale of equity, convertible debt or other equity-linked securities, our shareholders' ownership will be diluted. We may issue securities that have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our common stock.\nOur future capital requirements will depend upon a number of factors, including:\n\uf0b7the size, complexity, results and timing of our development programs and clinical trials;\n\uf0b7our ability to successfully commercialize our drug candidates, if approved;\n\uf0b7our ability to obtain sufficient supply of the compounds necessary for our drug candidates at a reasonable cost;\n\uf0b7the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals;\n\uf0b7the time and cost involved in developing any required companion diagnostics for any of our product candidates, including enobosarm;\n\uf0b7the terms and timing of any potential future collaborations, licensing or other arrangements we may establish;\n\uf0b7cash requirements of any future acquisitions, in-licenses or the development of other drug candidates;\n\uf0b7our receipt of funds from other potential sources, including cash flow from licenses and sales, and payments on outstanding receivables;\n\uf0b7the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims;\n\uf0b7the costs involved in manufacturing and commercializing our drug candidates;\n\uf0b7the amount of sales or other revenues from drug candidates that we may commercialize, if any, including the selling prices for such drug candidates and the availability of adequate third-party coverage and reimbursement;\n\uf0b7regulatory changes;\n\uf0b7changes to federal, state or local health care or prescription drug programs;\n\uf0b7market and economic conditions; and\n\uf0b7competing technological and market developments.\nThese factors could result in variations from currently projected operating and liquidity requirements.\nCOVID-19 and its impact on the economic environment and capital markets could adversely affect our access to capital when needed.\nWe expect to incur significant expenditures over the next several years to support our preclinical and clinical development activities, particularly with respect to clinical trials for certain of our drug candidates and to commence the commercialization of our drug candidates and to commercialize our marketed products. Market volatility resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors could adversely affect our ability to access capital as and when needed and could also adversely affect the terms of a financing. If sales of FC2 decline, sales of ENTADFI are lower than expected, or sabizabulin is not authorized for sale due, in any case, to the current economic environment, supply constraints or other issues, we may need additional financing to make up for reduced expected cash flows from these products. If adequate funds are not available on commercially acceptable terms when needed, we may be forced to delay, reduce or terminate some of our research and development activities or we may be unable to take advantage of future business opportunities.\nIf we fail to obtain additional capital, we may need to reduce the scope of our development or commercialization programs or we could be forced to share our rights to technologies with third parties on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nWe may need large amounts of capital to support our development and commercialization efforts for our drug candidates. If we are unable to secure sufficient capital to fund our operations as needed, we will not be able to continue these efforts and we might have to enter into strategic collaborations that could require us to share commercial rights to one or more of our drug candidates with third parties in ways that we currently do not intend or on terms that may not be favorable to us. We may also need to raise additional funds if we choose to expand more rapidly than we presently anticipate or we encounter any unforeseen events that affect our current business plan. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms and not enter into strategic collaborations, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted, and may continue to disrupt, our operations and the operations of our suppliers and customers.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have emerged in Wuhan, China. COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, has since spread to over 100 countries, including every state in the United States. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency with respect to the COVID-19 outbreak. The outbreak and government measures, which in the U.S. have been largely left to individual states with varying approaches, including orders to close businesses considered non-essential and orders for quarantining, taken in response have had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce, as worker shortages have occurred; supply chains have been disrupted; facilities and production have been suspended; and demand for certain goods and services, such as medical services and supplies, has spiked, while demand for other goods and services, such as travel, has fallen. We have also adopted various recommended policies and procedures applicable to office-based employees, including certain work from home measures, to protect the health and safety of our employees.\nIf COVID-19 continues to spread and to affect economic activity in the United States and other markets in which we conduct business, we may experience disruptions that could severely impact our business, including:\n\uf0b7if our Malaysian manufacturing facility is closed again our ability to supply product to our customers could be disrupted;\n\uf0b7we may encounter labor or raw material shortages, transportation delays or other issues at our Malaysian manufacturing facility or to our various customers;\n\uf0b7our personnel may not be able to travel between our facilities in the United States, the United Kingdom and Malaysia, which may impact our ability to effectively oversee our international operations;\n\uf0b7customer demand for FC2 may be adversely affected, including with respect to FC2 in the U.S. prescription market if insurance coverage is affected by job losses and in the global public health sector if governments delay future tenders or reduce spending on female condoms due to financial strains or changed spending priorities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\uf0b7our customers, including in the global public health sector, may reduce or delay orders or delay paying their accounts receivable balances due to liquidity issues, spending priorities or other issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including government-imposed closures or operating reductions;\n\uf0b7there may be limitations in employee resources, potentially including key executives, because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact;\n\uf0b7we may face delays in receiving approval from the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities in connection with our clinical trials;\n\uf0b7there may be delays or difficulties in enrolling patients in our clinical trials or in recruiting clinical site investigators and staff;\n\uf0b7there may be delays in clinical sites receiving the supplies and materials needed to conduct our clinical trials, including delays or interruptions in manufacturing and interruption in shipping;\n\uf0b7there may be changes in local regulations as part of a response to the COVID-19 outbreak which may require us to change the ways in which our clinical trials are conducted, to incur unexpected costs, or to discontinue the clinical trials altogether;\n\uf0b7healthcare resources may be diverted away from the conduct of clinical trials, including the diversion of hospitals serving as our clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of our clinical trials;\n\uf0b7key clinical trial activities may be interrupted, such as clinical trial site monitoring, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers and others, or the clinical research organizations or clinical trial sites own risks related to the COVID-19 outbreak, which could affect the integrity of clinical data or the conduct of the trial;\n\uf0b7participants enrolled in our clinical trials could acquire COVID-19 while the clinical trial is ongoing, which could impact the results of the clinical trial, including by increasing the number of observed adverse events;\n\uf0b7necessary interactions with local regulators, ethics committees and other important agencies and contractors may be delayed due to limitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government employees; and\n\uf0b7the FDA may refuse to accept data from clinical trials in affected geographies.\nSignificant uncertainty remains as to the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, and on the global economy. It is currently not possible to predict how long the pandemic will last or the time that it will take for economic activity to return to prior levels. We do not yet know the full extent of any impact on our business or our operations, and it is possible that its effect on our business and operations will significantly worsen in the future.\nOur FC2 business may be affected by contracting risks with government and other international health agencies.\nLarge international agencies and government health agencies which purchase and distribute FC2 for use in family planning and HIV/AIDS prevention programs have historically purchased significant quantities of FC2. Sales to such agencies may be subject to government contracting risks, including the appropriations process and funding priorities, potential bureaucratic delays in awarding contracts under governmental tenders, process errors, politics or other pressures, and the risk that contracts may be subject to cancellation, delay, or restructuring. A governmental tender award indicates acceptance of the bidders price rather than an order or guarantee of the purchase of any minimum number of units. Many governmental tenders are stated to be up to the maximum number of units, which gives the applicable government agency discretion to purchase less than the full maximum tender amount. As a result, government agencies may order and purchase fewer units than the full maximum tender amount and there are no guarantees as to the timing or amount of actual orders or shipments under government tenders. Orders received may vary from the amount of the tender award based on a number of factors, including vendor supply capacity, quality inspections, and changes in demand. These contracting risks may cause significant quarter-to-quarter variations in our operating results and could adversely affect our net revenues and profitability. Budget issues, spending cuts, and global health spending priorities affecting government health agencies may also adversely affect demand for FC2 and our net revenues.\nThe FDA issued a final order reclassifying female condoms as Class II medical devices, which may result in increased competition for FC2 in the U.S. market.\nOn September 21, 2018, the FDA issued a final order reclassifying female condoms from Class III to Class II medical devices, renaming them single-use internal condoms and requiring new devices in this category to submit a 510(k) premarket notification and comply with various special controls. Special controls are a battery of product clinical testing which includes, but is not limited to, determining product effectiveness against pregnancy and against infection transmission, and product tolerability. While FC2 is the only currently available female condom approved for marketing by the FDA in the U.S., this reclassification by the FDA may reduce the barriers for other types of female condoms to enter the U.S. market. If other female condoms enter the U.S. market, we may face increased competition in the U.S., which may put downward pressure on pricing for FC2 and adversely affect sales of FC2 in the U.S.\nWe may experience competition, especially for sabizabulin as a treatment for COVID-19, if authorized, ENTADFI, and FC2.\nWe are engaged in the marketing and development of products in industries, including the pharmaceutical industry, that are highly competitive. The pharmaceutical industry is also characterized by extensive research and rapid technological progress. Potential competitors with respect to our drug candidates in North America, Europe and elsewhere include major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology firms, universities and other research institutions and government agencies. Many of our competitors have substantially greater research and development and regulatory capabilities and experience, and substantially greater management, manufacturing, distribution, marketing and financial resources, than we have. We may be unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and competitive pressures could have a negative effect on our net revenues and profit margins.\nOther parties have developed and marketed female condoms, although only two such products presently have WHO pre-qualification and none of these female condoms have been approved for market by the FDA. FDA market approval is required to sell female condoms in the U.S., and WHO pre-qualification is required to sell female condoms to U.N. agencies. The FDAs reclassification of female condoms from Class III to Class II medical devices may reduce the barriers for other types of female condoms to enter the U.S. market. FC2 has also been competing with other female condoms in markets that do not require either FDA market approval or WHO prequalification. There are other polyethurane brands from China (Ormelle, Sensitex) that have CE-certification. We have experienced increasing competition in the global public health sector, and competitors received part of the last three South African tenders and the latest Brazilian tender. Increasing competition in FC2s markets has put pressure on pricing for FC2 and adversely affected sales of FC2, and some customers, particularly in the global public health sector, may prioritize price over other features where FC2 may have an advantage. It is also possible that other companies will develop a female condom, and such companies could have greater financial resources and customer contacts than us. In addition, other contraceptive and HIV-prevention and treatment methods compete with FC2 for funding and attention in the global public health sector.\nOther parties have developed and marketed drugs for prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Many of these parties are substantially larger than us and are substantially better capitalized and have more resources and commercialization resources than us. These parties may also have better relationships with government and commercial payors.\nOther parties have developed and marketed drugs for BPH that have been accepted by the physician, patient and payor communities. Many of these other products have also reached the point where they are now generic drugs, which means that they are sold at a very low price, a price which ENTADFI may not be able to meet which could limit ENTADFIs reach into the physician, patient and payor communities, including government payors.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our strategy to grow sales of FC2 or ENTADFI in the U.S. market or, if authorized, sabizabulin in the U.S. or any foreign market.\nIn 2017, we implemented a strategy to grow sales for FC2 in the U.S. market, focusing on prescription sales because FC2 is currently reimbursable by prescription under the ACA. As part of this growth strategy, we have developed relationships with distributors and telemedicine providers in the U.S. It is difficult to predict the degree of market acceptance and consumer demand we may achieve for FC2 in the U.S., and we may ultimately not be able to achieve or sustain significant sales growth in the U.S. market. Our prescription sales in the U.S. may also be adversely affected by regulations offering employers religious and moral exemptions from the ACAs requirement to provide insurance covering birth control. In addition, while we experienced fast growth in prescription sales of FC2 through fiscal 2021 largely through a small number of current telemedicine providers, prescription sales of FC2 to those current telemedicine providers declined significantly in fiscal 2022. We may not be able to return to sales growth in fiscal 2023 as our current customers may not resume past ordering patterns and we may not be able to add additional telemedicine providers. Any failure to achieve and sustain sales growth for FC2 in the U.S. market may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are currently working to establish our own dedicated direct to patient telemedicine and pharmacy services portal to continue to drive sales growth for FC2. We have never developed a telemedicine platform before. The cost and regulatory complexity required for launching this platform, including costs with collaborators who are helping us develop the platform, who will help us in our efforts to market the platform and FC2 and who will provide telehealth physician consultations, may outweigh any increased sales resulting from this effort. Similarly, any subsidies that we may offer to patients may be disallowed by regulators at any time. Any of these risks could harm patient acceptance of the platform and our ability to continue to grow FC2 sales.\nIf authorized, we may not be successful in commercializing sabizabulin for the treatment of certain hospitalized COVID-19 patients due to our inexperience in launching an in-patient drug, reluctance of physicians to treat patients with sabizabulin, reluctance of hospital formulary committees or pharmacy managers to add sabizabulin to their formulary protocols, our inability to achieve pricing for sabizabulin at a price that we believe is commercially reasonable or that recognized the value of sabizabulin, our inability to replicate the clinical trial results of sabizabulin in the post-authorization setting, unforeseen adverse events from treatment with sabizabulin or any other reason. In addition, we may fail to comply with the complex and broad set of laws, rules and regulations in the U.S. and in other countries or regions that govern the manufacture, promotion, pricing, and reimbursement of drugs like sabizabulin. Any of these risks could negatively affect our ability to establish sabizabulin as a viable treatment for certain COVID-19 patients or our ability to grow sales of sabizabulin, if authorized.\nWe may not be able to expand sales of ENTADFI through partnering with telemedicine or other partners or through our own commercialization efforts. We may not be able to command a price with private and government payors for ENTADFI that would justify our devotion of significant resources to attempting to grow sales of ENTADFI. We may not be able to compete efficiently or effectively in a mature BPH market which is heavily generic. Failure to grow sales of ENTADFI would have a negative effect on our revenue and future plans.\nWe may not be able to sustain price levels for FC2 in the U.S. market.\nPrice levels for sales of FC2 in a developed country such as the U.S. are typically higher than for sales to less developed countries in the global public health sector. Over time, due to increased competition or other factors, including any changes to and validity of ACA, we may experience price erosion in the U.S. market. Negative pressure on our price levels for U.S. sales may have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and gross margin in the U.S. market.\nAn inability to identify or complete future acquisitions could adversely affect our future growth.\nWe intend to pursue acquisitions of new products, technologies, and/or businesses that enable us to leverage our competitive strengths. While we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions, we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms, obtain regulatory approval for acquisitions where required, or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future. An inability to identify or complete future acquisitions could limit our future growth. Similarly, any use of our equity or a convertible debt security in any acquisition would be dilutive to our stockholders and may affect the market price of our shares.\nWe may experience difficulties in integrating strategic acquisitions.\nThe integration of acquired companies and their operations into our operations involves a number of risks, including:\n\uf0b7the acquired business may experience losses that could adversely affect our profitability;\n\uf0b7unanticipated costs relating to the integration of acquired businesses may increase our expenses;\n\uf0b7possible failure to accomplish the strategic objectives for an acquisition;\n\uf0b7the loss of key personnel of the acquired business;\n\uf0b7difficulties in achieving planned cost-savings and synergies may increase our expenses or decrease our net revenues;\n\uf0b7diversion of managements attention could impair their ability to effectively manage our business operations;\n\uf0b7the acquired business may require significant expenditures for product development or regulatory approvals;\n\uf0b7the acquired business may lack adequate internal controls or have other issues with its financial systems;\n\uf0b7there may be regulatory compliance or other issues relating to the business practices of an acquired business;\n\uf0b7we may record goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential impairment charges and we may also incur amortization expenses related to intangible assets; and\n\uf0b7unanticipated management or operational problems or liabilities may adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\nAdditionally, we may borrow funds or issue equity to finance strategic acquisitions. Debt leverage resulting from future acquisitions could adversely affect our operating margins and limit our ability to capitalize on future business opportunities. Such borrowings may also be subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Equity issuances may dilute our existing shareholders and adversely affect the market price of our shares.\nWe depend on two major customers for a significant portion of our net revenues.\nThe Company's two largest customers in fiscal 2022 accounted for 73% of the Companys net revenues. An adverse change in our relationship with our largest customers could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and profitability. Also, as we saw in fiscal 2022, adverse events at, and purchasing decisions by, these two customers can have a material adverse effect on our net revenues. In addition, we may have a concentration of accounts receivable with one or more of our largest customers, and a delay in payment by a large customer could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity.\nSince we sell FC2 in foreign markets, we are subject to international business risks that could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur international operations subject us to risks, including:\n\uf0b7economic and political instability;\n\uf0b7currency fluctuations;\n\uf0b7global pandemics, as governments reallocate their health or development budgets to other health areas;\n\uf0b7changes in international regulatory requirements, import duties, or export restrictions, including limitations on the repatriation of earnings;\n\uf0b7disruptions and price increases in the global transportation network, such as work stoppages, strikes or shutdowns of ports of entry or such other transportation sources, or delays or difficulties in products clearing customs;\n\uf0b7difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\uf0b7greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods;\n\uf0b7the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property in some countries;\n\uf0b7multiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as privacy regulations, including GDPR, tax laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, immigration laws, labor laws, regulatory requirements and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses;\n\uf0b7complications in complying with trade and foreign tax laws and greater risk of a failure of foreign employees, distributors or other agents to comply with both U.S. and foreign laws, including antitrust regulations, the FCPA and other anti-bribery or corruption laws, and trade regulations;\n\uf0b7price controls and other restrictions on foreign currency; and\n\uf0b7difficulties in our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies.\nAny of these risks might disrupt the supply of our products, increase our expenses or decrease our net revenues. The cost of compliance with trade and foreign tax laws increases our expenses, and actual or alleged violations of such laws could result in enforcement actions or financial penalties that could result in substantial costs.\nIncreases in the cost of raw materials, labor, and other costs used to manufacture FC2 could increase our cost of sales and reduce our gross margins.\nWe may experience increased costs of raw materials, including the nitrile polymer used in FC2, and increased labor costs. We may not be able to pass along such cost increases to our customers. As a result, an increase in the cost of raw materials, labor or other costs associated with manufacturing FC2 could increase our cost of sales and reduce our gross margins. We have seen a global shortage of a key ingredient used to manufacture FC2 lubricant, which may give future pricing pressure and stock availability. Strategic supply stocks have been ordered to mitigate this risk, but our supply may not be sufficient to meet demand for FC2 globally or in any particular market.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could increase our expenses.\nBecause we manufacture FC2 in a leased facility located in Malaysia, a portion of our operating costs are denominated in a foreign currency. While a material portion of our future sales of FC2 are likely to be in foreign markets, all sales of FC2 are denominated in U.S. dollars. Manufacturing costs are subject to normal currency risks associated with fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Malaysian ringgit (MYR) relative to the U.S. dollar. Historically, we have not hedged our foreign currency risk.\nWe rely on a single facility to manufacture FC2, which subjects us to the risk of supply disruptions.\nWe manufacture FC2 in a single leased facility located in Malaysia. Difficulties encountered by this facility, such as fire, accident, natural disaster, labor disruptions, or an outbreak of a contagious disease, including COVID-19, could halt or disrupt production at the facility, delay the completion of orders, or cause the cancellation of orders. Any of these risks could increase our expenses or reduce our net revenues.\nUncertainty and adverse changes in the general economic conditions may negatively affect our business.\nIf general economic conditions, including continued or worsening inflation or supply chain challenges, recessionary pressures, rising interest rates, labor shortages, and rising unemployment, in the U.S. and other global markets in which we operate decline, or if consumers fear that economic conditions will decline, consumers may reduce expenditures for products such as our existing and potential products. Adverse changes may occur as a result of adverse global or regional economic conditions, fluctuating oil prices, supply chain problems, inflation, political instability, declining consumer confidence, a continuation or worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic or another pandemic, unemployment, fluctuations in stock markets, contraction of credit availability, or other factors affecting economic conditions generally. These changes may negatively affect the sales of our existing or development of future products, increase the cost, and decrease the availability of financing, or increase costs associated with producing and distributing our products and potential drug candidates. In addition, a substantial portion of the sales of FC2 are made in the public market to government agencies, including USAID and other government agencies around the world. Worsening economic conditions as well as budget deficits and austerity measures may cause pressures on government budgets and result in a reduction in quantities or prices for purchases of FC2 by governmental agencies.\nSales of FC2 fluctuate, which causes our operating results to vary from quarter-to-quarter. Sales of FC2 fluctuate based upon demand from our commercial partners and the public health sector and the nature of government procurement processes. Historically, our net revenues and profitability have varied from quarter-to-quarter due to such buying patterns. Quarterly variations in operating results may cause us to fail to meet market expectations for our operating results and may tend to depress our stock price during such quarters.\nMaterial adverse or unforeseen legal judgments, fines, penalties, or settlements could have an adverse impact on our profits and cash flows.\nWe may, from time to time, become a party to legal proceedings incidental to our business, including, but not limited to, alleged claims relating to product liability, environmental compliance, patent infringement, commercial disputes, securities laws, antitrust and competition laws, regulatory or administrative actions, corporate matters and employment matters. The current and future use of our drug candidates by us and potential collaborators in clinical trials, and the sale of any approved products in the future, may expose us to product liability claims. We will face an inherent risk of product liability claims as a result of the clinical testing of our drug candidates and will face an even greater risk if we obtain FDA approval and commercialize our drug candidates in the U.S. or other additional jurisdictions or if we engage in the clinical testing of proposed new products or commercialize any additional products. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our existing products or drug candidates, if approved. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in any of the following:\n\uf0b7the inability to commercialize our drug candidates;\n\uf0b7difficulty recruiting subjects for clinical trials or withdrawal of these subjects before a trial is completed;\n\uf0b7labeling, marketing, or promotional restrictions;\n\uf0b7product recalls or withdrawals;\n\uf0b7decreased demand for our products or products that we may develop in the future;\n\uf0b7loss of revenue;\n\uf0b7injury to reputation;\n\uf0b7initiation of investigations by regulators;\n\uf0b7costs to defend the related litigation;\n\uf0b7substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients; and\n\uf0b7a decline in the value of our shares.\nLitigation could require us to record reserves or make payments which could adversely affect our profits and cash flows. Even the successful defense of legal proceedings may cause us to incur substantial legal costs, may divert management's attention and resources away from our business, may prevent us or our partners from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product and may substantially increase the costs of commercializing our future products and impair the ability to generate revenues from the commercialization of these products either by us or by our strategic alliance partners.\nWe currently maintain limited general commercial liability insurance coverage. However, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses. If a successful product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or for liabilities in excess of our insurance limits, our assets may not be sufficient to cover such claims and our business operations could be impaired.\nOur business and operations would suffer if we sustain cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches.\nOur information technology may be subject to cyber-attacks, security breaches or computer hacking. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal, proprietary or confidential information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. They also may be able to develop and deploy malicious software programs that attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. Our systems and the data stored on those systems may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks, acts of vandalism or theft, misplaced or lost data, human errors, or other similar events that could negatively affect our systems and our data, as well as the data of our business partners. Further, third parties, such as hosted solution providers, that provide services to us, could also be a source of security risk in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure.\nThe costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential suppliers or customers. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal, proprietary or confidential information about us, our business partners, participants in our clinical trials or other third parties could expose us to significant potential liability and reputational harm. In addition, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials as a result of a data security incident or other systems failure could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. As threats related to cyber-attacks develop and grow, we may also find it necessary to make additional investments to protect our data and infrastructure, which may impact our profitability. As a global enterprise, we could also be negatively impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, data privacy, data localization and data protection such as GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act.\nAny failure to comply with the FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdiction could materially adversely affect our business and result in civil and/or criminal sanctions.\nThe FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Because of the importance of the global public health sector for sales of FC2, many of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are with governmental entities and are therefore potentially subject to such laws. Global enforcement of anti-corruption laws has increased substantially in recent years, with more frequent voluntary self-disclosures by companies, aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental agencies, and assessment of significant fines and penalties against companies and individuals. Our international operations create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors, because these parties are not always subject to our control. Any alleged or actual violations of these regulations may subject us to government scrutiny, severe criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities, including exclusion from government contracting, and could disrupt our business, and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe will need to increase the size and complexity of our organization in the future, and we may experience difficulties in executing our growth strategy and managing any growth.\nOur management, personnel, systems and facilities currently in place may not be adequate to support our business plan and future growth. We will need to further expand our scientific, sales and marketing, managerial, operational, financial and other resources to support our planned research, development and commercialization activities.\nOur need to manage our operations, growth and various projects effectively requires that we:\n\uf0b7improve our operational, financial, management and regulatory compliance controls and reporting systems and procedures;\n\uf0b7attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees;\n\uf0b7manage our commercialization activities for our drug candidates effectively and in a cost-effective manner;\n\uf0b7manage our relationship with our partners related to the commercialization of our drug candidates;\n\uf0b7manage our clinical trials effectively;\n\uf0b7manage our internal manufacturing operations effectively and in a cost-effective manner while increasing production capabilities for our current drug candidates to commercial levels; and\n\uf0b7manage our development efforts effectively while carrying out our contractual obligations to partners and other third parties.\nIn addition, historically, we have utilized and continue to utilize the services of part-time outside consultants to perform a number of tasks for us, including tasks related to preclinical and clinical testing. Our growth strategy may also entail expanding our use of consultants to implement these and other tasks going forward. Because we rely on consultants for certain functions of our business, we will need to be able to effectively manage these consultants to ensure that they successfully carry out their contractual obligations and meet expected deadlines. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our existing consultants or find other competent outside consultants, as needed, on economically reasonable terms, or at all. If we are not able to effectively expand our organization by hiring new employees and expanding our use of consultants, we might be unable to implement successfully the tasks necessary to execute effectively on our planned research, development and commercialization activities and, accordingly, might not achieve our research, development and commercialization goals.\nUncertainties in the interpretation and application of tax rules in the various jurisdictions in which we operate could materially affect our deferred tax assets, tax obligations and effective tax rate.\nWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection and remittance obligations in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Additionally, at any point in time, we may be under examination for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes. We may recognize additional tax expense, be subject to additional tax liabilities, incur losses and penalties, due to changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, assessments by authorities and interpretations related to tax, including tax rules in various jurisdictions. We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate. As tax rates vary among countries, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision. Changes in enacted tax rates and the assumptions and estimates we have made, as well as actions we may take, could result in a write down of deferred tax assets or otherwise materially affect our tax obligations or effective tax rate, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur effective tax rate may be negatively impacted if we are unable to realize deferred tax assets or by future changes to tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S., the U.K. and other global jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income, if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates, or if there is a change to the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, which could result in a material increase in our effective tax rate. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings could have a material impact on our effective tax rate. Jurisdictions in which we operate, including the U.S. and the UK, may consider changes to existing tax laws. Such changes could increase our tax obligations in those countries where we do business. Any changes in the taxation of our activities in such jurisdictions may result in a material increase in our effective tax rate.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $112.5 million and $50.9 million, respectively, of which $29.7 million and $28.4 million, respectively, if not utilized to offset taxable income in future periods, will begin to expire in 2023 and will completely expire in 2042. Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code) and the regulations promulgated thereunder, including, without limitation, the consolidated income tax return regulations, various corporate ownership changes could limit our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset our income.\nAn ownership change (generally a 50% change in equity ownership over a three-year period) under Section 382 of the Code could limit our ability to offset, post-change, our U.S. federal taxable income. Section 382 of the Code imposes an annual limitation on the amount of post-ownership change taxable income a corporation may offset with pre-ownership change net operating loss carryforwards and certain recognized built-in losses.\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property\nWe may be unable to protect the proprietary nature of the intellectual property covering our products.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property rights to our products, drug candidates and technology as well as successfully defending these rights against third party challenges. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could harm our business and profitability. The patent positions of pharmaceutical products are highly uncertain. The legal principles applicable to patents are in transition due to changing court precedent and legislative action and we cannot be certain that the historical legal standards surrounding questions of validity will continue to be applied or that current defenses relating to issued patents in these fields will be sufficient in the future. Changes in patent laws in the United States, such as the America Invents Act of 2011, may affect the scope, strength and enforceability of our patent rights or the nature of proceedings that may be brought by us related to our patent rights. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these countries. We are limited in protecting our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties by the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.\nThese risks include the possibility of the following:\n\uf0b7the patent applications that we have filed may fail to result in issued patents in the United States or in foreign countries;\n\uf0b7patents issued or licensed to us or our partners may be challenged or discovered to have been issued on the basis of insufficient, incomplete or incorrect information, and thus held to be invalid or unenforceable;\n\uf0b7the scope of any patent protection may be too narrow to exclude competitors from developing or designing around these patents;\n\uf0b7we or our licensor was not the first to make the invention covered by an issued patent or pending patent application;\n\uf0b7we or our licensor was not the first inventor to file a patent application for the technology in the United States or was not the first to file a patent application directed to the technology abroad;\n\uf0b7we may fail to comply with procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process, which can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights;\n\uf0b7future drug candidates or our proprietary technologies may not be patentable or legal decisions may limit patent-eligible subject matter;\n\uf0b7others may claim rights or ownership with regard to patents and other proprietary rights that we hold or license;\n\uf0b7delays in development, testing, clinical trials and regulatory review may reduce the period of time during which we could market our drug candidates under patent protection;\n\uf0b7we may fail to timely apply for patents on our technologies or products; and\n\uf0b7inability to control patent prosecution, maintenance, or enforcement of any in-licensed intellectual property.\nWe cannot predict whether third parties will assert these claims against us or our strategic partners or against the licensors of technology licensed to us, or whether those claims will harm our business. In addition, the outcome of intellectual property litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance. If we or our partners were to face infringement claims or challenges by third parties relating to our drug candidates, an adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to such third parties and force us or our partners to curtail or cease the development of some or all of our drug candidates, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur or our licensors patents may expire or be invalidated, found to be unenforceable, narrowed or otherwise limited or our or our licensors patent applications may not result in issued patents or may result in patents with narrow, overbroad, or unenforceable claims.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection for our drug candidates, as well as the methods for treating patients in the prescribed indications using these drug candidates. We will be able to protect our drug candidates and the methods for treating patients in the indications using these drug candidates from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that we or our licensors own or control such valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets.\nEven if our drug candidates and the methods for treating patients for prescribed indications using these drug candidates are covered by valid and enforceable patents and have claims with sufficient scope, disclosure and support in the specification, the patents will provide protection only for a limited amount of time. Our and our licensors ability to obtain patents can be highly uncertain and involve complex and in some cases unsettled legal issues and factual questions. Furthermore, different countries have different procedures for obtaining patents, and patents issued in different countries provide different degrees of protection against the use of a patented invention by others. Therefore, if the issuance to us or our licensor, in a given country, of a patent covering an invention is not followed by the issuance, in other countries, of patents covering the same invention, or if any judicial interpretation of the validity, enforceability, or scope of the claims in, or the written description or enablement in, a patent issued in one country is not similar to the interpretation given to the corresponding patent issued in another country, our ability to protect our intellectual property in those countries may be limited. Changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may materially diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nWhile we will apply for patents covering our technologies and products, as we deem appropriate, many third parties may already have filed patent applications or have received patents in our areas of product development. These entities' applications, patents and other intellectual property rights may conflict with our patent applications or other intellectual property rights and could prevent us from obtaining patents, could call into question the validity of any of our patents, if issued, or could otherwise adversely affect our ability to develop, manufacture, commercialize or market our products. In addition, if third parties file patent applications which include claims covering any technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference, derivation or other proceedings with the USPTO, or foreign patent regulatory authorities to determine our rights in the technology, which may be time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, issued patents may be challenged in the courts or in post-grant proceedings at the USPTO, or in similar proceedings in foreign countries. These proceedings may result in loss of patent claims or adverse changes to the scope of the claims.\nIf we or our licensors or strategic partners fail to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products, or our proprietary technologies and their uses, companies may be dissuaded from collaborating with us. In such event, our ability to commercialize our drug candidates or future drug candidates, if approved, may be threatened, we could lose our competitive advantage and the competition we face could increase, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, mechanisms exist in much of the world permitting some form of challenge by generic drug marketers to patents prior to, or immediately following, the expiration of any regulatory exclusivity, and generic companies are increasingly employing aggressive strategies, such as at risk launches and compulsory licensing to challenge relevant patent rights.\nOur business also may rely on unpatented proprietary technology, know-how, and trade secrets. If the confidentiality of this intellectual property is breached, it could adversely impact our business.\nWe are dependent in part on some license relationships.\nWe have acquired by license intellectual property and technology relating to our sabizabulin and enobosarm drug candidates and might enter into additional licenses in the future. Licenses to which we are a party contain, and we expect that any future licenses will contain, provisions requiring up-front, milestone and royalty payments to licensors. If we fail to comply with these obligations or other obligations to a licensor, that licensor might have the right to terminate the license on relatively short notice, in which event we would not be able to commercialize the drug candidates that were covered by the license. Also, the milestone and other payments associated with these licenses will make it less profitable for us to develop our drug candidates.\nWe may face claims that our intellectual property infringes on the intellectual property rights of third parties. If we infringe intellectual property rights of third parties, it may increase our costs or prevent us from being able to commercialize our product candidates.\nOur success depends, in part, on not infringing the patents and proprietary rights of other parties and not breaching any license, collaboration or other agreements we enter into with regard to our technologies and products. Numerous United States and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by others also exist in the therapeutic areas in, and for the therapeutic targets for, which we intend to develop drugs. Patent applications are confidential when filed and remain confidential until publication, approximately 18 months after initial filing, while some patent applications remain unpublished until issuance. As such, there may be other third-party patents and pending applications of which we will be unaware with claims directed towards composition of matter, formulations, methods of manufacture, or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our products or drug candidates. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty the nature or existence of every third-party patent filing. We cannot be sure that we or our partners will be free to manufacture or market our drug candidates as planned or that us or our licensors' and partners' patents will not be opposed or litigated by third parties. If any third-party patent was held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods of treatment related to the use or manufacture of any of our drug candidates, the holders of any such patent may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable drug candidate unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires or is finally determined to be held invalid or unenforceable. We may not be able to obtain a license to such patent on favorable terms or at all. Failure to obtain such license may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThere is a risk that we are infringing the proprietary rights of third parties because numerous United States and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields that are the focus of our development and manufacturing efforts. Others might have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our or our licensors pending patent applications and issued patents and/or might have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions. In addition, because patent applications take many months to publish and patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us or our licensor, which may later result in issued patents that cover the production, manufacture, synthesis, commercialization, formulation or use of our product candidates. In addition, the production, manufacture, synthesis, commercialization, formulation or use of our product candidates may infringe existing patents of which we are not aware. Defending ourselves against third-party claims, including litigation in particular, would be costly and time consuming and would divert managements attention from our business, which could lead to delays in our development or commercialization efforts. If third parties are successful in their claims, we might have to pay substantial damages or take other actions that are adverse to our business.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving intellectual property in the pharmaceutical industry. If a third party asserts that we infringe its patents or other proprietary rights, we could face a number of risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, including the following:\n\uf0b7infringement and other intellectual property claims would be costly and time-consuming to defend, whether or not we are ultimately successful, and could delay the regulatory approval process, consume our capital and divert management's attention from our business;\n\uf0b7we may have to pay substantial damages for past infringement if a court determines that our products or technologies infringe a competitor's patent or other proprietary rights;\n\uf0b7a court may prohibit us from selling or licensing our technologies or future products unless a third party licenses its patents or other proprietary rights to us on commercially reasonable terms, which it is not required to do;\n\uf0b7if a license is available from a third party, we may have to pay substantial royalties or lump sum payments or grant cross licenses to our patents or other proprietary rights to obtain that license; or\n\uf0b7we may need to redesign our products so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time.\nWe cannot predict whether third parties will assert these claims against us or our strategic partners or against the licensors of technology or other intellectual property licensed to us, or whether those claims will harm our business. In addition, the outcome of intellectual property litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance. If we or our partners were to face infringement claims or challenges by third parties relating to our drug candidates, an adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to such third parties and force us or our partners to curtail or cease the development of some or all of our drug candidates, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe must submit patent certifications in connection with the 505(b)(2) FDA regulatory pathway.\nWe intend to submit NDAs for certain of our drug candidates under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, which was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, otherwise known as the Hatch-Waxman Act. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA when at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. To the extent that a Section 505(b)(2) NDA relies on clinical trials conducted for a previously approved drug product or the FDA's prior findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved drug product, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant must submit patent certifications in its Section 505(b)(2) NDA with respect to any patents for the approved product on which the application relies that are listed in the FDA's publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly referred to as the Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify for each listed patent that (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is not sought until after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the proposed new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the previously approved product's listed patent or that such patent is invalid or unenforceable is known as a Paragraph IV certification.\nIf the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the owner of the referenced NDA for the previously approved product and relevant patent holders within 20 days after the Section 505(b)(2) NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement suit against the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification prevents the FDA from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the date of the lawsuit, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The court also has the ability to shorten or lengthen the 30-month period if either party is found not to be reasonably cooperating in expediting the litigation. Thus, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of its product only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before its product may be commercialized. Alternatively, if the NDA or relevant patent holder does not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the specified 45-day period, the FDA may approve the Section 505(b)(2) application at any time.\nIf we cannot certify that all of the patents listed in the Orange Book for the approved products referenced in the NDAs for each of our drug candidates have expired, we will be compelled to include a Paragraph IV certification in the NDA for such drug candidate. Our inability to certify that all of the patents listed in the FDA's Orange Book for approved products referenced in the NDAs for each of our drug candidates could have a serious and significant adverse effect on the timing for obtaining approval of our drug candidates.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our competitors.\nAs is common in the pharmaceutical industry, we will employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may be subject to claims that these employees, or we, have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Such claims may lead to material costs for us, or an inability to protect or use valuable intellectual property rights, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may need to file lawsuits or take other actions to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights.\nWe may be subject to competition from third parties with products in the same class of products as our drug candidates or products with the same active pharmaceutical ingredients as our drug candidates in those jurisdictions in which we have no patent protection. Even if patents are issued to us or our licensor regarding our drug candidates or methods of using them, those patents can be challenged by our competitors who can argue such patents are invalid or unenforceable, lack of utility, lack sufficient written description or enablement, or that the claims of the issued patents should be limited or narrowly construed. Patents also will not protect our product candidates if competitors devise ways of making or using these product candidates without legally infringing our patents. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and FDA regulations and policies create a regulatory environment that encourages companies to challenge branded drug patents or to create non-infringing versions of a patented product in order to facilitate the approval of abbreviated new drug applications for generic substitutes. These same types of incentives encourage competitors to submit new drug applications that rely on literature and clinical data not prepared for or by the drug sponsor, providing another less burdensome pathway to approval.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, we may not have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue such infringement claims, which typically last for years before they are concluded. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to pharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights, generally.\nIn addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that one of our patents or one of our licensor's patents is not valid or is unenforceable or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents, or those of our licensors, do not cover the technology in question or on other grounds. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents, or those of our licensors, at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications, or those of our licensors, at risk of not issuing. Moreover, we may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries in which the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States or in those countries in which we do not file national phase patent applications. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. The occurrence of any of the above could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may fail to protect the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information.\nWe also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially where we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our confidential information to competitors, and confidentiality agreements may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOwnership in our common stock is highly concentrated and your ability to influence corporate matters may be limited as a result.\nAs of November 30, 2022, our executive officers and directors collectively beneficially owned approximately 23.9% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, including approximately 11.2% beneficially owned by Mitchell Steiner, M.D., our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and 10.7% beneficially owned by Harry Fisch, M.D., our Vice Chairman and Chief Corporate Officer. These shareholders may have the ability to exert significant influence over the outcome of shareholder votes, including votes concerning director elections, amendments to our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and other significant corporate transactions. In addition, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquiror from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our business, even if such a transaction would benefit other stockholders. The interests of such stockholders may not always coincide with your interests or the interests of other stockholders and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders.\nWe incurred a charge to earnings in fiscal 2020 resulting from the APP Acquisition, and additional charges to earnings resulting from the APP Acquisition in the future may cause our operating results to suffer.\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, we allocated the total purchase price of the APP Acquisition to APP's net tangible assets and intangible assets based on their respective fair values as of the date of the APP Acquisition and recorded the excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill. Management's estimates of the fair value of such assets was based upon assumptions that they believed to be reasonable but that will be inherently uncertain. The following factors, among others, could result in material charges that would cause our financial results to be negatively impacted:\n\uf0b7impairment of intangible assets, including in-process research and development (IPR&D); and\n\uf0b7impairment of goodwill.\nConsidering the high-risk nature of research and development and the industrys success rate of bringing developmental compounds to market, charges relating to impairment of acquired IPR&D are likely to occur in future periods. For example, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we recognized $14.1 million of impairment charges related to the IPR&D acquired in connection with the APP Acquisition, which increased our net loss and net loss per share for fiscal 2020. If there are additional impairment charges in the future, they would also be accounted for as expenses that would decrease net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those adjustments are made.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is required annually to deliver a report that assesses the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, for as long as we remain a non-accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC, our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to deliver an annual attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We will cease to be a non-accelerated filer if (a) the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter is $75 million or more and we reported annual net revenues of greater than $100 million for our most recently completed fiscal year or (b) the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter is $700 million or more, regardless of annual net revenues. If we cease to be a non-accelerated filer, we would again be subject to the requirement for an annual attestation report by our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may not be able to produce accurate financial statements, and investors may therefore lose confidence in our operating results, our stock price could decline and we may be subject to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions.\nWe are a smaller reporting company and will be able to avail ourselves of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a smaller reporting company, as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not smaller reporting companies, including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer a smaller reporting company. We will remain a smaller reporting company until (a) the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter is $250 million or more and we reported annual net revenues as of our most recently completed fiscal year is $100 million or more, or (b) the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter is $700 million or more, regardless of annual revenue.\nThere are provisions in our charter documents, Wisconsin law and our residual royalty agreement that might prevent or delay a change in control of our company.\nWe are subject to a number of provisions in our charter documents, Wisconsin law and our residual royalty agreement with SWK Funding LLC that may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable. These provisions include the following:\n\uf0b7the authority provided to our Board of Directors in our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to issue preferred stock without further action by our shareholders;\n\uf0b7the provision under Wisconsin law that permits shareholders to act by written consent only if such consent is unanimous;\n\uf0b7the provision under Wisconsin law that requires for a corporation such as us, that was formed before January 1, 1973, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of our voting stock to approve an amendment to our articles of incorporation, a merger submitted to a vote of our shareholders, or a sale of substantially all of our assets;\n\uf0b7advance notice procedures for nominations of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder proposals to be considered at shareholders meetings;\n\uf0b7the Wisconsin control share acquisition statute and Wisconsin's fair price and business combination provisions which limit the ability of an acquiring person to engage in certain transactions or to exercise the full voting power of acquired shares under certain circumstances; and\n\uf0b7our residual royalty agreement with SWK Funding LLC requires a mandatory prepayment upon a change of control of Veru or a sale of our FC2 business.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience substantial losses.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile. The trading price of our common stock could decline or fluctuate in response to a variety of factors, including:\n\uf0b7our failure to meet market expectations for our performance;\n\uf0b7the timing of announcements by us or our competitors concerning significant product developments, acquisitions, or financial performance;\n\uf0b7adverse results or delays in our clinical trials for our drug candidates;\n\uf0b7changes in laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\uf0b7competition from new products that may emerge;\n\uf0b7actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition or operating results;\n\uf0b7substantial sales of our common stock;\n\uf0b7issuance of new or updated research reports from securities analysts;\n\uf0b7announcement or expectation of additional debt or equity financing efforts;\n\uf0b7additions or departures of key personnel;\n\uf0b7general stock market conditions;\n\uf0b7attacks by short sellers or substantial short interest in our common stock; or\n\uf0b7other economic or external factors.\nYou may be unable to sell your stock at or above your purchase price.\nIf our stock price declines, our common stock may be subject to delisting from the NASDAQ Capital Market.\nIf the closing bid price of our common stock is less than $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days, we may receive a letter from the staff of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC stating that our common stock will be delisted unless we are able to regain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rule requiring that we maintain a closing bid price for our common stock of at least $1.00 per share. We cannot guarantee that our stock price will continue to trade above $1.00 per share or otherwise meet the NASDAQ listing requirements and therefore our common stock may in the future be subject to delisting. If our common stock is delisted, this would, among other things, substantially impair our ability to raise additional funds and could result in a loss of institutional investor interest and fewer development opportunities for us.\nA substantial number of shares may be sold in the market, which may depress the market price for our common stock.\nSales of a significant number of shares of our common stock, or the expectation that such sales may occur, could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. We have also registered the offer and sale of all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans, including upon the exercise of stock options, and shares of common stock we may issue under our current common stock purchase agreement with Aspire Capital Fund, LLC (Aspire Capital), including 8,375,667 shares of common stock that we have issued under our current common stock purchase agreement with Aspire Capital and a prior agreement through the date of this report. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance.\nAdditionally, sales of our common stock by our executive officers or directors, even when done during an open trading window under our policies with respect to insider sales, may adversely impact the trading price of our common stock. Although we do not expect that the relatively small volume of such sales will itself significantly impact the trading price of our common stock, the market could react negatively to the announcement of such sales, which could in turn affect the trading price of our common stock.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be our shareholders sole source of gain.\nWe have not declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock since May 2014. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be our shareholders sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNot Applicable Item 2.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nVeru is a biopharmaceutical company with a drug development program for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients at high risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other viral-related ARDS and for the management of advanced breast and prostate cancers, as well as a sexual health program which includes two FDA-approved products, ENTADFI\u2122, for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and the FC2 Female Condom\u00ae (Internal Condom).\nInfectious Disease Program:\nThe Company opportunistically developed sabizabulin 9mg, which has both broad anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties as a two-pronged approach to the treatment of COVID-19 virus infection in hospitalized moderate to severe patients at high risk for ARDS and death.\nWe discovered that sabizabulin, which is being developed for cancer indications, also has both broad anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties. We hypothesized that based on this mechanism of drug action, sabizabulin may serve as a two-pronged approach to the treatment of COVID-19 viral infection, and the subsequent debilitating inflammatory effects that can lead to ARDS and death. The Company has completed a positive Phase 2 and positive Phase 3 COVID-19 study evaluating sabizabulin in hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients at high risk for ARDS and death. The Phase 3 clinical study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 204 hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients at high risk for ARDS and death. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients that died by Day 60. Based on a planned interim analysis of the first 150 patients randomized, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee unanimously halted the study for clear clinical efficacy and identified no safety concerns. Treatment with sabizabulin 9 mg once daily resulted in a clinically meaningful and statistically significant 51.6% relative reduction in deaths compared to placebo. On June 7, 2022, the Company submitted a request for FDA emergency use authorization for sabizabulin in adult hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients at high risk for ARDS and death.\nOn May 10, 2022, the Company had a pre-EUA meeting with the FDA to discuss next steps including the submission of an EUA application regarding sabizabulin for COVID-19. The outcome of this meeting was: (i) the FDA agreed that no additional efficacy studies were required to support an EUA application or a new drug application (NDA); and (ii) the FDA agreed that no additional safety data was required to support an EUA application and that collection of safety data under the EUA may satisfy the safety requirement for an NDA. The FDA agreed that the request for the EUA is supported by efficacy and safety from our positive Phase 3 COVID-19 study in hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients who are at high risk for ARDS and death and no additional clinical trials are required to support an NDA submission. On June 7, 2022, the Company submitted a request for FDA emergency use authorization. On July 6, 2022, the Company announced the publication of the results from the Phase 3 COVID-19 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of oral sabizabulin in The New England Journal of Medicine Evidence. On November 9, 2022, the FDAs Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee (PADAC) met to review sabizabulin for the EUA in hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients who are at high risk for ARDS. The advisory committee voted 8-5 that the known and potential benefits of sabizabulin when used for the treatment of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at high risk of ARDS do not outweigh the known and potential risks of sabizabulin. However, there was additional discussion around the clinical trial design aspects of a potential confirmatory Phase 3 COVID-19 clinical trial as a post emergency use authorization requirement. The FDA considers the input of the advisory committee as part of their review of the EUA, but the advisory committee decision is not binding and the FDA makes the final decision on the request for EUA application.\nThe UKs MHRA informed the Company on July 25, 2022, that the sabizabulin marketing authorization application will receive expedited review. On July 27, 2022, sabizabulin triggered Article 18 in the EU in which the EMA will evaluate sabizabulin to allow emergency use drug access to the EU Member States. On August 22, 2022, Australias TGA determined that sabizabulin treatment in hospitalized COVID-19 patients at high risk for ARDS qualifies for an expedited, provisional registration regulatory pathway.\nWe want to focus the clinical development of sabizabulin, a broad spectrum antiviral and anti-inflammatory agent, as a treatment for additional indications in COVID-19 ARDS, Influenza related ARDS, and other viral-associated ARDS.\nOncology Program:\nThe Companys breast cancer drug pipeline has four clinical development programs for two drugs: enobosarm, oral selective androgen receptor agonist, and sabizabulin, oral microtubule disruptor.\nHormone receptor positive HER2- metastatic breast cancer:\nPhase 3 clinical study - Enobosarm as a 3rd line treatment of AR+ER+HER2- metastatic breast cancer. We are enrolling the Phase 3 multicenter, international, open label, and randomized (1:1) ARTEST registration clinical trial design to evaluate the efficacy and safety of enobosarm monotherapy versus physicians choice of either exemestane \uf0b1 everolimus or a SERM as the active comparator for the treatment of AR+ ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer in approximately 210 patients with sufficient AR nuclei staining in their breast cancer tissue who had tumor progression on a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor, fulvestrant, and a CDK4/6 inhibitor. We have identified that patients who have sufficient AR nuclei staining in their breast cancer tissue are most likely to respond to enobosarm. Based on the recommendation of the FDA to have a companion diagnostic test to determine the patients AR status, we are partnering with Roche/Ventana Diagnostics, a global oncology diagnostics company, who will develop and commercialize a companion diagnostic AR test.\nPhase 2b clinical study - Sabizabulin as a 3rd line treatment of AR+ER+HER2- metastatic breast cancer. We also intend to conduct a Phase 2b clinical study of sabizabulin, a novel oral cytoskeleton disruptor, for the treatment of AR+ ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer in patients with sufficient AR nuclei staining. The Phase 2b clinical trial will be an open label, multicenter, and randomized (1:1) study evaluating the efficacy and safety of sabizabulin 32mg monotherapy versus physicians choice of either exemestane \uf0b1 everolimus or a SERM as the active comparator for the treatment of ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer in approximately 200 patients with sufficient AR nuclei staining in their breast cancer tissue who had tumor progression on a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor, fulvestrant, and a CDK4/6 inhibitor.\nPhase 3 clinical study - Enobosarm + abemaciclib combination as a 2nd line treatment of AR+ER+HER2- metastatic breast cancer. We are enrolling a Phase 3 multicenter, open label, randomized (1:1), active control clinical study, named ENABLAR-2 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of enobosarm plus abemaciclib combination therapy versus an alternative estrogen blocking agent (fulvestrant or an aromatase inhibitor) in subjects with AR+ ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer who have failed first line palbociclib (a CDK4/6 inhibitor) plus an estrogen blocking agent (non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant) and have sufficient AR nuclei staining in their breast cancer tissue. We plan to enroll approximately 186 subjects in this Phase 3 clinical study. In January 2022, the Company entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement through which Eli Lilly and Company supplies abemaciclib for the ENABLAR-2 trial.\nThe Companys prostate cancer drug pipeline includes sabizabulin, VERU-100 and zuclomiphene citrate.\nSabizabulin 32mg for the treatment of metastatic castration resistant and androgen receptor targeting agent resistant prostate cancer-\nPhase 1b/2 clinical studies to determine maximum tolerated dose and recommended dosing of sabizabulin. We are completing the Phase 1b open label clinical trial of sabizabulin in 39 men with metastatic castration resistant and androgen receptor targeting agent resistant prostate cancer \u00b1 taxane chemotherapy and the Phase 2 clinical study in 41 men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer who have also become resistant to at least one androgen receptor targeting agent, but prior to proceeding to IV chemotherapy. In the Phase 1b/2 studies, sabizabulin was both well tolerated and demonstrated promising preliminary efficacy data.\nPhase 3 VERACITY clinical study. We are currently enrolling the Phase 3 VERACITY registration study evaluating sabizabulin 32mg in men approximately 245 men who have metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer and who had tumor progression while receiving at least one androgen receptor targeting agent, but prior to IV chemotherapy.\n\u200e\nVERU-100, long acting GnRH antagonist subcutaneous depot, for the treatment of advanced hormone sensitive prostate cancer-\nPhase 2 dose finding clinical study. Currently enrolling study to determine optimal dose of VERU-100 in men with advance hormone sensitive prostate cancer.\nPhase 3 registration clinical study. If the Phase 2 trial is successful, and as discussed with and agreed upon by the FDA, the Phase 3 clinical trial will be a single arm, multicenter, open-label study in approximately 100 men with hormone sensitive advanced prostate cancer using the achievement and maintenance of castration levels of testosterone as the primary endpoint.\n\u200eZuclomiphene citrate, estrogen receptor agonist, for the treatment of hot flashes caused by prostate cancer hormonal therapies in men with advanced prostate cancer-\nPhase 2b zuclomiphene clinical study. The Company reported positive dose finding Phase 2 study in January 2020. The Company plans to further optimize the dosing schedule of zuclomiphene citrate in a Phase 2b study.\nSexual Health Program:\nThe Company's sexual health program includes two FDA-approved products: ENTADFI\u2122, for the treatment of BPH, and FC2, for the dual protection against unplanned pregnancy and the transmission of sexually transmitted infections.\nENTADFI\u2122 (tadalafil and finasteride) capsules, for oral use was approved by the FDA as a new oral treatment for BPH, or an enlarged prostate gland. The co-administration of tadalafil and finasteride has been shown to provide faster and more effective treatment of BPH than finasteride alone without causing unwanted sexual side effects. ENTADFI treats BPH with low potential for adverse sexual side effects, and we believe that ENTADFI being one single pill will help increase drug compliance whereas poor compliance with a BPH medicine could lead to an increased chance of acute urinary retention, urosepsis, and death. We have now initiated the U.S. commercial launch and availability of ENTADFI. We plan to market ENTADFI to healthcare providers and patients through digital marketing channels and distribution will also be conducted through pharmaceutical distribution channels. We plan to augment our marketing and sales efforts by seeking partners in the U.S. that offer us the ability to expand access through telemedicine and internet pharmacy services and will continue our search for the right commercial partners outside the U.S.\nThe Company sells FC2 in both the commercial sector and in the public health sector both in the U.S. and globally. In the U.S., FC2 is available by prescription through multiple telemedicine and internet pharmacy channels as well as retail pharmacies. The Company has launched its own dedicated direct to patient telemedicine and pharmacy services portal/platform to continue to drive sales growth. FC2 is also available to public health sector entities such as state departments of health and 501(c)(3) organizations. In the global public health sector, the Company markets FC2 to entities, including ministries of health, government health agencies, U.N. agencies, nonprofit organizations and commercial partners, that work to support and improve the lives, health and well-being of women around the world.\nMost of the Companys net revenues are currently derived from sales of FC2 in the commercial and public health sectors.\nPREBOOST\u00ae Sale\nOn December 8, 2020, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with Roman Health Ventures Inc. (the Purchaser). Pursuant to, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser purchased substantially all of the assets related to the Company's PREBOOST\u00ae business. PREBOOST\u00ae is a 4% benzocaine medicated individual wipes for the treatment of premature ejaculation. The transaction closed on December 8, 2020. The purchase price for the transaction was $20.0 million, consisting of $15.0 million paid at closing, $2.5 million payable 12 months after closing and $2.5 million payable 18 months after closing. The Company has received all such purchase price payments.\nCOVID-19 Environment\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have emerged in Wuhan, China. COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, has since spread to over 100 countries, including every state in the United States. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency with respect to the COVID-19 outbreak.\nIn an effort to contain and mitigate the spread of COVID-19, many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Malaysia, imposed unprecedented restrictions on travel, and there were business closures and a substantial reduction in economic activity in countries that had significant outbreaks of COVID-19. In addition, and in an attempt to slow the rapid growth of the COVID-19 infection rate, many governments around the world, including in the United States at the federal, state and local levels as well as in the United Kingdom and Malaysia, have from time to time imposed mandatory sheltering in place and social distancing restrictions that severely limit the ability of its citizens to travel freely and to conduct activities. While many countries have relaxed these restrictions, surges in COVID-19 could lead to some or all of such restrictions being reimposed in the U.S. or elsewhere.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has substantially impacted the global healthcare system, including the conduct of clinical trials. Many healthcare systems have restructured operations to prioritize caring for those suffering from COVID-19 and to limit or cease other activities. The severe burden on healthcare systems caused by this pandemic has also impaired the ability of many research sites to start new clinical trials or to enroll new patients in clinical trials. The imposed mandatory sheltering in place and social distancing restrictions may delay the recruitment of patients and impede their ability to effectively participate in such trials. Significant fees may also be owed to contract research organizations associated with starting and stopping clinical trials, typically more so than delaying the start of a clinical trial.\nTo date, COVID-19 has not impacted the Companys ability to supply product demand for FC2. Since the start of the pandemic, we have, from time to time, experienced some temporary disruptions to our manufacturing facility due to the implementation of government policies.\nThe Company has enrolled manufacturing staff in a vaccination program. 100% of the staff have received two doses of vaccination and more than 90% of staff have also received a booster. This has allowed shift patterns to return to normal and the facility is allowed to operate at 100% capacity under the current Malaysia control orders.\nThe Company has had and believes it continues to have a sufficient quantity of FC2 inventory both inside and outside of Malaysia to satisfy expected customer demand. The closure and reduced operating capacity due to COVID-19 during fiscal 2021 did not have a material impact to the Companys consolidated operating results in fiscal 2021 or the first half of fiscal 2022 and we do not expect them to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated operating results in foreseeable future periods. The Company continues to operate enhanced health and safety protocols to protect the employees at its Malaysian facility, to respond in the event an employee at the facility is determined to have tested positive for COVID-19, and to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the Companys Malaysian manufacturing operations. However, no such measures can eliminate risks relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, and if the Companys Malaysian manufacturing facility is subject to future government mandates to counter COVID-19 or encounters labor or raw material shortages, transportation delays or other issues, our ability to supply product to our customers could be disrupted.\nThe sole supplier of the nitrile polymer sheath for FC2 also produces surgical gloves and has at times prioritized their production during the COVID-19 pandemic and may continue to do so, which could disrupt the Companys supply of a critical raw material. However, at this time Malaysian ports are open for shipment, and we have only seen short delays in booking vessels for FC2 so we have factored this into our lead times when shipping product into key markets. Further actions taken to mitigate these factors include the Companys continued focus on build of strategic stock to ensure supply is available during a period of potential disruption. The COVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruption may also adversely affect customer demand for FC2. For example, sales of FC2 could be impacted in the U.S. prescription channel if insurance coverage is affected by job losses and in the global public health sector if governments delay future tenders or reduce spending on female condoms due to financial strains or changed spending priorities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material net impact on our consolidated operating results during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nSignificant uncertainty remains as to the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, and on the global economy. It is currently not possible to predict how long the pandemic will last or the time that it will take for economic activity to return to prior levels as a result of uncertainties, including the extent and rate of the spread of the virus that continue to fluctuate, the potential for additional peaks in infection rates, and the timing and availability of vaccines, treatments or cures to slow and eventually stop the spread. We do not yet know the full extent of any impact on our business or our operations; however, we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation and its impact on our business closely and expect to reevaluate the timing of our anticipated clinical trials as the impact of COVID-19 on our industry becomes clearer.\nSales of FC2 in commercial and global public health sectors\nFC2 Commercial Sector. In 2017, the Company began expanding access to FC2 in the U.S. by making it available by prescription. With a prescription, FC2 is covered by most insurance companies with no copay, coinsurance or deductible under the ACA. In 2018, we dissolved our small-scale marketing and sales program to focus our efforts in accessing fast-growing, highly reputable telemedicine firms to bring our much-needed FC2 product to patients with a prescription in a cost-effective and highly convenient manner. As a result of these efforts, the Company now supplies FC2 to telemedicine providers in the U.S. prescription channel. The Company continues working to develop supply and distributor relationships with additional telemedicine and other providers. The Company has launched its own dedicated direct to patient telemedicine platform and pharmacy services portal to continue to drive sales growth.\nFC2 Global Public Health Sector. FC2s use is for the prevention of HIV/AIDS and the transmission of other sexually transmitted diseases and prevention of unplanned pregnancies, and the global public health sector has been an important market for FC2. Within the global public health sector, various organizations supply critical products such as FC2, at no cost or low cost, to those who need but cannot afford to buy such products for themselves.\nFC2 has been distributed in the U.S. and 149 other countries. A significant number of countries with the highest demand potential are in the developing world. The incidence of HIV/AIDS, other sexually transmitted infections and unplanned pregnancy in these countries represents a remarkable potential for significant sales of a product that benefits some of the worlds most underprivileged people. However, conditions in these countries can be volatile and result in unpredictable delays in program development, tender applications and processing orders.\nThe Company is working to further develop a global market and distribution network for FC2 by maintaining relationships with global public health sector groups and completing strategic arrangements with companies with the necessary marketing and financial resources and local market expertise.\nThe Company currently has a limited number of customers for FC2 in the global public health sector who generally purchase in large quantities. Over the past few years, significant customers have included large global agencies, such as UNFPA, USAID, the Brazil Ministry of Health through Semina Ind\u00fastria e Com\u00e9rcio Ltda (Semina), the Company's distributor in Brazil, and the Republic of South Africa health authorities that purchase through the Company's various local distributors. Other customers include ministries of health or other governmental agencies, which either purchase directly or via in-country distributors, and NGOs.\nPurchasing patterns for FC2 in the public health sector vary significantly from one customer to another and may reflect factors other than simple demand. For example, some governmental agencies purchase FC2 through a formal procurement process in which a tender (request for bid) is issued for either a specific or a maximum unit quantity. Tenders also define the other elements required for a qualified bid submission (such as product specifications, regulatory approvals, clearance by the World Health Organization, unit pricing and delivery timetable). Bidders have a limited period of time in which to submit bids. Bids are subjected to an evaluation process which is intended to conclude with a tender award to the successful bidder. The entire tender process, from publication to award, may take many months to complete, including administrative actions or appeals. A tender award indicates acceptance of the bidders price rather than an order or guarantee of the purchase of any minimum number of units. Many governmental tenders are stated to be up to the maximum number of units, which gives the applicable government agency discretion to purchase less than the full maximum tender amount. Orders are placed after the tender is awarded; there are often no set dates for orders in the tender and there are no guarantees as to the timing or amount of actual orders or shipments. Orders received may vary from the amount of the tender award based on a number of factors including vendor supply capacity, quality inspections and changes in demand. Administrative issues, politics, bureaucracy, exchange rate risk, process errors, changes in leadership, funding priorities and/or other pressures may delay or derail the process and affect the purchasing patterns of public health sector customers. As a result, the Company may experience significant quarter-to-quarter sales variances in the global public health sector due to the timing and shipment of large orders of FC2.\nIn February 2022, the Company received a tender award to supply 57% of a tender covering up to 120 million female condoms over three years in the Republic of South Africa. The Company has received its first orders and is manufacturing units under this tender award. In October 2020, the Company was awarded up to 20 million units through its distributor in Brazil under the new Brazil female condom tender. The Company shipped approximately 9.7 million units under this tender in fiscal 2021. The Company does not anticipate any additional shipments under this tender in Brazil.\nRevenues. The Company's revenues are primarily derived from sales of FC2 in the U.S. prescription channel and global public health sector. The Company also had revenues from sales of PREBOOST\u00ae (Roman Swipes) through the date the PREBOOST\u00ae business was sold on December 8, 2020. The Company has also begun to recognize revenues from sales of ENTADFI. These sales are recognized upon shipment or delivery of the product to the customers depending on contract terms.\nThe Companys most significant customers have been telemedicine providers in the U.S. who sell into the prescription channel and global public health sector agencies who purchase and/or distribute FC2 for use in preventing the transmission of HIV/AIDS and/or family planning.\nThe Company manufactures FC2 in a leased facility located in Selangor D.E., Malaysia, resulting in a portion of the Company's operating costs being denominated in foreign currencies. While a significant portion of the Company's future unit sales are likely to be in foreign markets, all sales are denominated in the U.S. dollar. Effective October 1, 2009, the Companys U.K. and Malaysia subsidiaries adopted the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, further reducing the Companys foreign currency risk.\nOperating Expenses. The Company manufactures FC2 at its Malaysian facility. The Company's cost of sales consists primarily of direct material costs, direct labor costs and indirect production and distribution costs. Direct material costs include raw materials used to make FC2, principally a nitrile polymer. Indirect production costs include logistics, quality control and maintenance expenses, as well as costs for electricity and other utilities. All the key components for the manufacture of FC2 are essentially available from either multiple sources or multiple locations within a source.\nWe have recently seen increases in the cost of the nitrile polymer used to produce FC2, as well as transportation, and may experience increases in other material costs due to the impact of COVID-19 and increased inflation. Our costs of sales and gross margins may be adversely impacted if we are unable to pass along cost increases to our customers.\nConducting research and development is central to our business model. The Company has multiple products under development and management routinely evaluates each product in its portfolio of products. Advancement is limited to available working capital and managements understanding of the prospects for each product. If future prospects do not meet managements strategic goals, advancement may be discontinued. We have invested and expect to continue to invest significant time and capital in our research and development operations. Our research and development expenses were $70.6 million and $32.7 million for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. In fiscal 2023, we expect to continue this trend of increased expenses relating to research and development due to advancement of multiple drug candidates.\n\u200e\nResults of Operations\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021\nThe Company generated net revenues of $39.4 million and net loss of $83.8 million, or $(1.05) per basic and diluted common share, in fiscal 2022, compared to net revenues of $61.3 million and net income of $7.4 million, or $0.10 per basic common share and $0.09 per diluted common share, in fiscal 2021. Net revenues decreased 36% year over year.\nMost of the Companys net revenues were derived from sales of FC2 in the U.S. prescription channel and global public health sector. FC2 net revenues decreased 35% year over year. There was a 44% decrease in total FC2 unit sales and an increase in FC2 average sales price per unit of 17%. The principal factor for the increase in the FC2 average sales price per unit compared to prior year was an increase in the selling price of FC2 in the U.S. prescription channel and a decrease in volume discounts. The Company experienced a decrease of 35% in FC2 net revenues in the U.S. prescription channel and a decrease of 34% in FC2 net revenues in the global public health sector. The decrease in FC2 net revenues in the U.S. prescription channel is due to lower volume from telemedicine customers as a result of business challenges they experienced, which resulted in a slowdown in orders during the current year. We are working to restore ordering and utilization patterns in future periods based on growing awareness and demand through increased FC2 marketing efforts, as well as on-going discussions with new distribution partners in the telehealth sector. We are also working to generate additional revenues through our internal telehealth platform. We also expect to see growth in average sales price per unit based on the price increase in the U.S. prescription channel effective during fiscal 2022. We are working to increase U.S. public sector revenues through two new exclusive agreements recently executed. The reduction in the global public health sector is primarily due to sales in fiscal 2021 related to the Brazil and South Africa tenders, which did not repeat in fiscal 2022. Based on the recently awarded tender in South Africa for delivery in fiscal 2023, we expect to see an increase in sales volume in the global public health sector. Results in fiscal 2021 included net revenues of $0.9 million related to the PREBOOST\u00ae business before the sale of such business in December 2020. The Company began recognizing revenue from sales of ENTADFI in September 2022. Results in fiscal 2022 were not materially affected by such sales.\nSignificant variances in the Companys results have historically resulted from the timing and shipment of large orders rather than from any fundamental changes in the business or the underlying demand for FC2. The Company is also currently seeing pressure on pricing for FC2 by large global agencies and donor governments in the developed world. As a result, the Company may continue to experience challenges for revenue from sales of FC2 in the global public health sector.\nCost of sales decreased to $8.8 million in fiscal 2022 from $13.3 million in fiscal 2021 primarily due to the decrease in unit sales.\nGross profit decreased to $30.6 million in fiscal 2022 from $47.9 million in fiscal 2021. Gross profit margin for fiscal 2022 was 78% of net revenues, which is consistent with that in fiscal 2021. The decrease in gross profit is primarily due to the decrease in the volume of FC2 sales.\nResearch and development expenses increased to $70.6 million in fiscal 2022 from $32.7 million in fiscal 2021, an increase of 116%. The increase is primarily due to increased costs associated with the multiple in-process research and development projects, mainly for the Phase 3 COVID-19 registration trial, the Phase 3 VERACITY clinical study, and the Phase 3 ARTEST study; as well as increased personnel costs. During fiscal 2022, the Company had four Phase 3 clinical trials and two Phase 2 clinical trial ongoing with additional clinical trial initiations planned, compared to three Phase 3 clinical trials and three Phase 2 clinical trials during fiscal 2021. This clinical trial activity has resulted in increased costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased to $43.2 million in fiscal 2022 from $20.7 million in fiscal 2021, an increase of 109%. The increase is due primarily to the following: an increase in compensation costs, resulting from increased personnel and an increase in salaries for a cost-of-living adjustment; increased share-based compensation costs, resulting from an increase in headcount and an increase in the fair value of stock options due to increased volatility in our stock price; and additional costs associated with the commercialization of ENTADFI\u2122, commercialization costs related to preparations for the potential launch of sabizabulin for COVID-19, and the launch of the Companys own dedicated direct to patient telemedicine and pharmacy services portal/platform for FC2.\nDuring fiscal 2021, we recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of the Companys PREBOOST\u00ae business of $18.4 million. See Note 2 to the financial statements included in this report for additional information.\nInterest expense, which is related to the Credit Agreement and Residual Royalty Agreement, was $4.4 million in fiscal 2022, which is a decrease from $4.9 million in fiscal 2021. The decrease is due to amortization of discounts and deferred issuance costs in fiscal 2021 related to the Credit Agreement, which was paid in full in fiscal 2021, partially offset by an increase in the accretion of the Residual Royalty Agreement liability.\nIncome recorded associated with the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives related to Residual Royalty Agreement was $3.6 million in fiscal 2022 compared to expense of $3.7 million in fiscal 2021. The liabilities associated with embedded derivatives represent the fair value of the change of control provisions in the Credit Agreement and Residual Royalty Agreement. The decrease in the fair value of the embedded derivates is due to a decrease in projected FC2 net revenues in future periods and increase in the discount rates used, driven by external market factors. See Note 3 and Note 9 to the financial statements included in this report for additional information.\nThe income tax expense in fiscal 2022 was $236,000, compared to the income tax benefit of $3.1 million in fiscal 2021. The change in income tax expense is primarily due to a tax benefit recorded in fiscal 2021 resulting from an adjustment to the value of the U.K. net operating losses due to an increase in the U.K. tax rates from 19% to 25% in fiscal 2021. The U.S. continues to have a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets; therefore, activity in the U.S. does not have a material effect on income tax expense.\nLiquidity and Sources of Capital\nLiquidity\nOur cash and cash equivalents on September 30, 2022 was $80.2 million, compared to $122.4 million on September 30, 2021. On September 30, 2022, the Company had working capital of $63.3 million and stockholders equity of $80.8 million compared to working capital of $136.0 million and stockholders equity of $152.3 million as of September 30, 2021. The decrease in working capital is primarily due to the decrease in cash and cash equivalents, related to our increased research and development expenditures, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued research and development costs.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to consume cash as we develop our drug candidates. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of pharmaceutical products, we are unable to estimate the exact amounts of capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to fund development of our drug candidates and obtain regulatory approvals. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Capital for a description of certain risks that will affect our future capital requirements.\nThe Company believes its current cash position and cash expected to be generated from sales of the Companys commercial products are adequate to fund planned operations of the Company for the next 12 months. To the extent the Company may need additional capital for its operations or the conditions for raising capital are favorable, the Company may access financing alternatives that may include debt financing, common stock offerings, or financing involving convertible debt or other equity-linked securities and may include financings under the Companys current effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-239493) or under a new registration statement.\nOperating activities\nOur operating activities used cash of $47.5 million in fiscal 2022. Cash used in operating activities included net loss of $83.8 million, adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities totaling an increase of $10.4 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $25.9 million. Adjustments to net income primarily consisted of share-based compensation of $11.2 million and noncash interest expense of $1.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in the fair value of derivative liabilities of $3.6 million. The increase in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities included an increase in accounts payable of $18.6 million, an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $8.7 million, and a decrease in accounts receivable of $4.5 million, partially offset by an increase in inventory of $3.1 million and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.4 million.\nOur operating activities used cash of $15.6 million in fiscal 2021. Cash used in operating activities included net income of $7.4 million, adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities totaling a reduction of $15.7 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $7.3 million. Adjustments to net income primarily consisted of $18.4 million for the gain on sale of the PREBOOST\u00ae business, $3.6 million of interest paid in excess of interest expense, and $3.6 million of deferred income taxes, partially offset by share-based compensation of $5.1 million and an increase in the fair value of derivative liabilities of $3.7 million. The decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities included an increase in accounts receivable of $3.6 million and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $8.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $4.2 million.\nInvesting activities\nNet cash from investing activities was $4.3 million in fiscal 2022, attributed to $5.0 million received on notes receivable from the sale of the Companys PREBOOST\u00ae business, partially offset by $0.7 million in capital expenditures for manufacturing and office equipment.\nNet cash from investing activities was $14.6 million in fiscal 2021, attributed to $15.0 million received from the sale of the Companys PREBOOST\u00ae business, partially offset by $0.4 million in capital expenditures for manufacturing and office equipment.\nFinancing activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2022 was $1.1 million and primarily consisted of proceeds from stock option exercises of $1.1 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2021 was $109.7 million and primarily consisted of proceeds from the underwritten public offering of the Companys common stock, net of fees and costs paid through September 30, 2021, of $108.0 million (see discussion below) and proceeds from stock option exercises of $1.8 million.\nSources of Capital\nCommon Stock Offering\nOn February 22, 2021, we completed an underwritten public offering of 7,419,354 shares of our common stock, which included the exercise in full of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares, at a public offering price of $15.50 per share. Net proceeds to the Company from this offering were $108.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and costs incurred by the Company. All of the shares sold in the offering were by the Company. The offering was made pursuant to the Companys shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-239493).\nSWK Credit Agreement and Residual Royalty Agreement\nOn March 5, 2018, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (as amended, the Credit Agreement) with the financial institutions party thereto from time to time (the Lenders) and SWK Funding LLC, as agent for the Lenders (the Agent), for a synthetic royalty financing transaction. On and subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Lenders provided the Company with a term loan of $10.0 million, which was advanced to the Company on the date of the Credit Agreement. Under the Credit Agreement, the Company was required to make quarterly payments on the term loan based on the Companys product revenue from net sales of FC2 until the earlier of receipt by the Lenders of a return premium specified in the Credit Agreement or a required payment upon termination of the Credit Agreement on March 5, 2025 or an earlier change of control of the Company or sale of the FC2 business. The Company repaid the loan and return premium specified in the Credit Agreement in August 2021, and as a result has no further obligations under the Credit Agreement. The Agent has released its security interest in Company collateral previously pledged to secure its obligations under the Credit Agreement.\nIn connection with the Credit Agreement, Veru and the Agent also entered into a Residual Royalty Agreement, dated as of March 5, 2018 (as amended, the Residual Royalty Agreement), which provides for an ongoing royalty payment of 5% of product revenue from net sales of FC2, which continues after the repayment of the loan and return premium under the Credit Agreement. The Residual Royalty Agreement will terminate upon (i) a change of control or sale of the FC2 business and the payment by the Company of the amount due in connection therewith pursuant to the Credit Agreement, or (ii) mutual agreement of the parties.\nThe Company made total payments under the Residual Royalty Agreement of $2.6 million and $1.1 million during fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company made total payments under the Credit Agreement of $7.3 million during fiscal 2021. The Company currently estimates the aggregate amount of quarterly revenue-based payments payable during the 12-month period subsequent to September 30, 2022 will be approximately $1.2 million under the Residual Royalty Agreement.\nCommon Stock Purchase Agreements\nOn June 26, 2020, the Company entered into a common stock purchase agreement (the 2020 Purchase Agreement) with Aspire Capital which provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein, the Company has the right, from time to time in its sole discretion during the 36-month term of the 2020 Purchase Agreement, to direct Aspire Capital to purchase up to $23.9 million of the Companys common stock in the aggregate. Upon execution of the 2020 Purchase Agreement, the Company issued and sold to Aspire Capital under the 2020 Purchase Agreement 1,644,737 shares of common stock at a price per share of $3.04, for an aggregate purchase price of $5,000,000. Other than the 212,130 shares of common stock issued to Aspire Capital in consideration for entering into the 2020 Purchase Agreement and the initial sale of 1,644,737 shares of common stock, the Company has no obligation to sell any shares of common stock pursuant to the 2020 Purchase Agreement and the timing and amount of any such sales are in the Company's sole discretion subject to the conditions and terms set forth in the 2020 Purchase Agreement. The Company has not sold shares to Aspire Capital under the 2020 Purchase Agreement since June 2020. As of September 30, 2022, there was $18.9 million remaining under the 2020 Purchase Agreement, which is registered under the Companys shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-239493).\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The Company is required to adopt various accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions in preparing its financial statements that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience to the extent practicable and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made. If the Companys assumptions prove inaccurate or if future results are not consistent with historical experience, the Company may be required to make adjustments in its policies that affect reported results. The Companys significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to the financial statements included in this report.\nThe Companys most critical accounting estimates include: valuation of tax assets and liabilities, measurement of fair value, and valuation of goodwill and intangible assets. The Company has other key accounting policies that are less subjective and, therefore, their application is less subject to variations that would have a material impact on the Companys reported results of operations. The following is a discussion of the Companys most critical policies, as well as the estimates and judgments involved.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company files separate income tax returns for its foreign subsidiaries. ASC Topic 740 requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are also provided for carryforwards for income tax purposes. In addition, the amount of any future tax benefits is reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent such benefits are not expected to be realized.\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax-effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.\nThe Company completes a detailed analysis of its deferred income tax valuation allowances on an annual basis or more frequently if information comes to its attention that would indicate that a revision to its estimates is necessary. In evaluating the Companys ability to realize its deferred tax assets, management considers all available positive and negative evidence on a country by country basis, including past operating results and forecasts of future taxable income, and the potential Section 382 limitation on the net operating loss carryforwards due to a change in control. In determining future taxable income, management makes assumptions to forecast U.S. federal and state, U.K. and Malaysia operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment regarding the forecasts of the future taxable income in each tax jurisdiction and are consistent with the forecasts used to manage the Companys business. It should be noted that the Company realized significant losses through 2005 on a consolidated basis. From fiscal 2006 through fiscal 2015, the Company generated taxable income on a consolidated basis. However, the Company had a cumulative pretax loss in the U.S. for fiscal 2022 and the three preceding fiscal years. Forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is significant negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years. Management has projected future pretax losses in the U.S. driven by the investment in research and development and based on their analysis concluded that an additional valuation allowance of $25.8 million should be recorded against the U.S. deferred tax assets related to federal and state net operating loss carryforwards as of September 30, 2022. In addition, the Companys U.K. holding company for the non-U.S. operating companies, The Female Health Company Limited, continues to have a full valuation allowance of $3.2 million. The operating U.K. subsidiary, The Female Health Company (UK) plc does not have a valuation allowance due to projections of future taxable income for the next 10 years.\nAlthough management uses the best information available, it is reasonably possible that the estimates used by the Company will be materially different from the actual results. These differences could have a material effect on the Company's future results of operations and financial condition.\nOur effective tax rates have differed from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of foreign operations, state taxes and addition of the valuation allowance against the NOL carryforwards. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, and accounting principles. In addition, we may be subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. We assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\nFair Value Measurements\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Companys financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, which consisted of embedded derivatives, represents the fair value of the change of control provisions in the Residual Royalty Agreement. See Note 9 to the financial statements included in this report.\nThe fair value of these liabilities were estimated based on unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement), which requires highly subjective judgment and assumptions. The Company previously determined the fair value of the embedded derivatives using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Since the Credit Agreement has been satisfied as of September 30, 2021, the fair value of the embedded derivative within the Residual Royalty Agreement has been calculated by using a scenario-based method, whereby different scenarios are valued and probability weighted. The Company determined that with only the embedded derivative under the Residual Royalty Agreement remaining, there is no material difference between these two valuation models. The scenario-based valuation model incorporates transaction details such as the contractual terms of the instrument and assumptions including projected FC2 revenues, expected cash outflows, probability and estimated dates of a change of control, risk-free interest rates and applicable credit risk. As a result, the use of different estimates or assumptions would result in a higher or lower fair value and different amounts being recorded in the Companys financial statements. Material changes in any of these inputs could result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement at future reporting dates, which could have a material effect on our results of operations. See Note 3 to the financial statements included in this report.\nThe fair value of the embedded derivatives at September 30, 2022 was $4.3 million compared to $7.9 million at September 30, 2021. The Company recognized non-operating income of $3.6 million to adjust the fair value of these instruments. The decrease in the fair value of the embedded derivates is due to a decrease in projected FC2 net revenues in future periods and increases in the discount rates, resulting from external market factors.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe Company has $6.9 million recorded as goodwill at September 30, 2022 and 2021 and $4.0 million recorded as intangible assets at September 30, 2022 and 2021. The Company evaluates the carrying value of its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consists of in-process research and development (IPR&D), on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently when indicators of impairment exist. An impairment of goodwill could occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit. An impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets would occur if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value. Intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If these facts and circumstances exist, the Company assesses for recovery by comparing the carrying values of the assets with their future undiscounted net cash flows. Significant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that are used in the preparation of expected undiscounted cash flows.\nRegarding goodwill, the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in projections and assumptions; therefore, in some instances changes in these assumptions could potentially lead to impairment. We perform sensitivity analyses around our assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the results of our testing. See further discussion in Note 1 to the financial statements included in this report.\nIPR&D assets are considered to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development projects. During the period the assets are considered indefinite-lived, they are tested for impairment. If the related project is terminated or abandoned, the Company may have a full or partial impairment related to the IPR&D assets, calculated as the excess of their carrying value over fair value. The valuation process is very complex and requires significant input and judgment using internal and external sources with respect to the Companys future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings, and other assumptions and estimates. See further discussion in Note 1 and Note 8 to the financial statements included in this report.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to the financial statements included in this report for additional information on recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nAlthough the Company cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation, the Company has experienced increased costs of product, supplies, salaries and benefits, and increased general and administrative expenses. The Company has, where possible, increased selling prices to offset such increases in costs.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe Company's exposure to market risk is limited to fluctuations in raw material commodity prices, particularly the nitrile polymer used to manufacture FC2, and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the Company's foreign operations. The Company does not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes or to hedge risk and holds no derivative financial instruments which would expose it to significant market risk. Effective October 1, 2009, the Company's U.K. subsidiary and Malaysia subsidiary each adopted the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. The consistent use of the U.S. dollar as the functional currency across the Company reduces its foreign currency risk and stabilizes its operating results. The Companys distributors are subject to exchange rate risk as their orders are denominated in U.S. dollars and they generally sell to their customers in the local country currency. If currency fluctuations have a material impact on a distributor it may ask the Company for pricing concessions or other financial accommodations. The Company currently has no significant exposure to interest rate risk. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe response to this item is submitted in a separate section of this report. See Index to Consolidated Financial Statements for a list of the financial statements being filed herein. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Evaluation Date). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commissions rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As required by Rule 13a-15(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, our management has carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the last fiscal year. The framework on which such evaluation was based is contained in the report entitled Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO Report) in 2013.\nOur system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nBased on its assessment, management has concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the COSO in 2013.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nBecause we are a non-accelerated filer, our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.

(PCAOB ID No. 49)\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Veru Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Veru Inc. (the Company) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets\nAs described in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has recorded net deferred tax assets totaling approximately $13.0 million and net deferred tax liabilities totaling approximately $81,000 at September 30, 2022. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $45.4 million at September 30, 2022 against its deferred tax assets in the United States and certain deferred tax assets in the United Kingdom. The Company has approximately $12.6 million of net deferred tax assets in the United Kingdom (U.K.) for which there is no valuation allowance. Management assesses the need for valuation allowances at least annually. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a tax valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating the Company's ability to realize its deferred tax assets, management considers all available positive and negative evidence on a country-by-country basis, including past operating results, forecasts of future taxable income and the potential Section 382 limitation on the net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards due to a change in control. In determining future taxable income, management makes assumptions to forecast U.S. federal and state, U.K. and Malaysia operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies.\nWe identified the deferred tax valuation allowance as a critical audit matter because of the assumptions management makes in determining the estimate which consists of forecasting future taxable income by jurisdiction. Auditing management's forecast of future taxable income in the U.K. involved a high degree of subjectivity and auditor judgment as changes in the assumptions could have a significant impact on the realization of the deferred tax assets in the U.K.\nOur audit procedures related to the realization of the Company's deferred tax assets included the following, among others:\n\uf0b7We evaluated management's ability to accurately forecast revenue and taxable income by comparing management's prior forecasts to historical results for the U.K.\n\uf0b7We evaluated the reasonableness of management's forecasted revenue and taxable income, including revenue growth rates and margins, by comparing the projections to historic results and industry expectations.\n\uf0b7We evaluated the reasonableness of management's forecasted revenue by comparing the projections and assumptions utilized to evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\n\uf0b7With the assistance of tax specialists, we compared tax rates and remaining lives of NOLs utilized by management to regulations in effect.\n\uf0b7We tested the mathematical accuracy of the calculation.\n/s/ RSM US LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1996.\nChicago, Illinois\nDecember 5, 2022\n\u200e\nVERU INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2022 AND 2021\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash

The Company is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel medicines for COVID-19 and other viral acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-related diseases and for oncology. The Company has multiple drug products under clinical development. The Company also has two FDA-approved products: ENTADFI, a new initial treatment for men with lower urinary tract symptoms from an enlarged prostate that was approved by the FDA in fiscal 2022, and the FC2 Female Condom/FC2 Internal Condom\u00ae (FC2), an internal condom for the prevention of pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, and HIV/AIDs. Most of the Companys net revenues during fiscal 2022 and 2021 were derived from sales of FC2.\nFC2 has been distributed in either or both commercial (private sector) and public health sector markets in 150 countries. It is marketed to consumers in 22 countries through distributors, public health programs, and/or retailers and in the U.S. by prescription. ENTADFI, which was made available for commercial sale in August 2022, is currently being distributed in the U.S. through pharmaceutical distribution channels.\nUse of estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nSegments: We regularly review our operating segments and the approach used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Prior to the commercialization of ENTADFI, we managed two distinct business segments: Pharmaceuticals, which engaged exclusively in research and development activities and FC2, which included the Companys single commercial product. Beginning in the second quarter of 2022, as a result of added commercialization efforts related to ENTADFI and sabizabulin as a treatment for COVID-19, the Company now operates as a single operating segment. Our determination that we operate as a single segment is consistent with the financial information regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (CODM) for purposes of evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting for future periods. Our CODM allocates resources and assesses financial performance on a consolidated basis.\nCash and cash equivalents and concentration: Cash and cash equivalents, which primarily consist of cash on deposit with financial institutions and highly liquid money market funds, are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at cost, which approximates fair value. The Company treats short-term, highly liquid funds that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities of three months or less as cash equivalents. The Companys cash is maintained primarily in three financial institutions, located in Chicago, Illinois; London, England; and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\nAccounts receivable and concentration of credit risk: Accounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for returns, discounts, and doubtful receivables based on a review of all outstanding amounts on a periodic basis.\nInventories: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Inventories are also written down for managements estimates of product which will not sell prior to its expiration date. Write-downs of inventories establish a new cost basis which is not increased for future increases in the net realizable value of inventories or changes in estimated obsolescence.\nThe Company capitalizes inventory costs associated with its drug products following regulatory approval when future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. Prior to an initial regulatory approval for our drug products under clinical development, we expense costs relating to the production of inventory as research and development expense in the Companys consolidated statements of operations, in the period incurred.\nFixed assets: We record equipment, furniture and fixtures, and leasehold improvements at historical cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are recorded to expense. Depreciation and amortization are primarily computed using the straight-line method, over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets.\nLeases: Leases are classified as either operating or finance leases at inception. A right-of-use (ROU) asset and corresponding lease liability are established at an amount equal to the present value of fixed lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. The ROU asset includes any initial direct costs incurred and lease payments made at or before the commencement date and is reduced by lease incentive payments. The Company has elected not to separate the lease and nonlease components for all classes of underlying assets. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate to determine the present value of the lease payments for leases that do not have a readily determinable implicit discount rate. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that the Company would be charged to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term and amount in a similar economic environment. The Company determines the incremental borrowing rates for its leases by adjusting the risk-free interest rate with a credit risk premium corresponding to the Companys credit rating.\nOperating lease costs are recognized for fixed lease payments on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Finance lease costs are a combination of the amortization expense for the ROU asset and interest expense for the outstanding lease liability using the applicable discount rate. Variable lease payments are recognized when incurred based on occurrence or usage. Short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expense for short-term leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nPatents and trademarks: The costs for patents and trademarks are expensed when incurred.\nGoodwill and intangible assets: The Companys goodwill and intangible assets, primarily developed technology and in-process research and development (IPR&D), arose from the acquisition of APP (the APP Acquisition) on October 31, 2016. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. IPR&D is accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until the underlying project receives regulatory approval, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are subject to an impairment review annually, in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently when indicators of impairment exist. An impairment of goodwill could occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit. An impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets would occur if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value. Intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. These intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization.\nGoodwill consists of the cost of an acquired business in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. The Companys goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the synergies of a business combination. The Company has identified two reporting units within its single operating segment. The Company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. For its quantitative impairment tests, the Company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the Company's business plans and a market participant's views. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in different impacts to the Company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the Company's estimates. The fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount and an impairment charge would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting units fair value.\nRegarding goodwill, the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in projections and assumptions; therefore, in some instances changes in these assumptions could potentially lead to impairment. We perform sensitivity analyses around our assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the results of our testing. Changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value. We believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value; however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material.\nIntangible assets are highly vulnerable to impairment charges, particularly IPR&D. These assets are initially measured at fair value and therefore any reduction in expectations used in the valuations could potentially lead to impairment. Some of the more common potential risks leading to impairment include competition, earlier than expected loss of exclusivity, pricing pressures, adverse regulatory changes or clinical trial results, delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval, additional development costs, inability to achieve expected synergies, higher operating costs, changes in tax laws and other macro-economic changes. The complexity in estimating the fair value of intangible assets in connection with an impairment test is similar to the initial valuation. The Company has previously recorded impairment charges related to IPR&D. Considering the high-risk nature of research and development and the industrys success rate of bringing developmental compounds to market, additional IPR&D impairment charges are likely to occur in future periods.\nDeferred financing costs: Costs incurred in connection with the common stock purchase agreements discussed in Note 10 have been included in other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2022 and 2021. When shares of the Companys common stock are sold under the common stock purchase agreement, a pro-rata portion of the deferred costs is recorded to additional paid-in-capital.\nCosts incurred in connection with the issuance of debt discussed in Note 9 were recorded as a reduction of the credit agreement liability and were amortized using the effective interest method over the repayment period of the debt. The debt was repaid in August 2021. The amortization is included in interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended September 30, 2021.\nFair value measurements: Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820 - Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. FASB ASC Topic 820 requires disclosures about the fair value of all financial instruments, whether or not recognized, for financial statement purposes. Disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments are based on pertinent information available to us as of the reporting dates. Accordingly, the estimates presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized on disposition of the financial instruments. See Note 3 for a discussion of fair value measurements.\nThe carrying amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities approximate their fair value based on the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of long-term debt, taking into consideration debt discounts and related derivative instruments, is estimated to approximate fair value.\nDerivative instruments: The Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market or foreign currency risks. The Company reviews the terms of debt instruments it enters into to determine whether there are embedded derivative instruments, which are required to be bifurcated and accounted for separately as derivative financial instruments. Embedded derivatives that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract are bifurcated and are recognized at fair value with changes in fair value recognized as either a gain or loss in earnings. Liabilities incurred in connection with an embedded derivative are discussed in Note 9.\nRevenue recognition: Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those products. See Note 4 for further discussion on revenue.\nResearch and development costs: Research and development costs are expensed as they are incurred and include salaries and benefits, costs to conduct clinical trials, and contract services. Nonrefundable advance payments made for goods or services to be used in research and development activities are deferred and capitalized until the goods have been delivered or the related services have been performed. If the goods are no longer expected to be delivered or the services are no longer expected to be performed, the Company would be required to expense the related capitalized advance payments. The Company did not have any material capitalized nonrefundable advance payments as of September 30, 2022 or September 30, 2021.\nThe Company records estimated costs of research and development activities conducted by third-party service providers, which include the conduct of preclinical studies and clinical trials and contract manufacturing activities. These costs are a significant component of the Companys research and development expenses. The Company accrues for these costs based on factors such as estimates of the work completed and in accordance with agreements established with its third-party service providers under the service agreements. The Company makes significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrued liabilities balance in each reporting period. As actual costs become known, the Company adjusts its accrued liabilities. The Company has not experienced any material differences between accrued costs and actual costs incurred. However, the status and timing of actual services performed, number of patients enrolled and the rate of patient enrollments may vary from the Companys estimates, resulting in adjustments to expense in future periods. Changes in these estimates that result in material changes to the Companys accruals could materially affect the Companys results of operations.\nPrior to an initial regulatory approval for our drug products under clinical development, we expense costs relating to the production of inventory as research and development expense in the Companys consolidated statements of operations, in the period incurred. In fiscal 2022, we recorded $18.6 million as research and development expense for pre-launch inventory costs related to sabizabulin as a treatment for COVID-19. Pre-launch inventory costs included in research and development expense were immaterial to the Companys results of operations in fiscal 2021.\nShare-based compensation: The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense in connection with its share-based awards, based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Calculating share-based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective judgment and assumptions, including estimates of the expected life of the share-based award, stock price volatility and risk-free interest rate.\nAdvertising: The Company's policy is to expense advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs were immaterial to the Companys results of operations for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nIncome taxes: The Company files separate income tax returns for its foreign subsidiaries. FASB ASC Topic 740 requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are also provided for carryforwards for income tax purposes. In addition, the amount of any future tax benefits is reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent such benefits are not expected to be realized.\nForeign currency translation and operations: Effective October 1, 2009, the Company determined that there were significant changes in facts and circumstances, triggering an evaluation of its subsidiaries functional currency, resulting in the adoption of the U.S. dollar as the functional currency for all foreign subsidiaries. The consistent use of the U.S. dollar as the functional currency across the Company reduces its foreign currency risk and stabilizes its operating results. The cumulative foreign currency translation loss included in accumulated other comprehensive loss was $0.6 million as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021. Assets located outside of the U.S. totaled approximately $10.8 million and $8.5 million at September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively.\nOther comprehensive loss: Accounting principles generally require that recognized revenue, expenses, gains and losses be included in net loss. Although certain changes in assets and liabilities, such as foreign currency translation adjustments, are reported as a separate component of the equity section of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, these items, along with net loss, are components of other comprehensive loss.\nThe U.S. parent company and its U.K. subsidiary routinely purchase inventory produced by its Malaysia subsidiary for sale to their respective customers. These intercompany trade accounts are eliminated in consolidation. The Companys policy and intent is to settle the intercompany trade account on a current basis. Since the U.K. and Malaysia subsidiaries adopted the U.S. dollar as their functional currencies effective October 1, 2009, no foreign currency gains or losses from intercompany trade are recognized. In fiscal 2022 and 2021, comprehensive income (loss) is equivalent to the reported net income (loss).\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements: In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The new guidance eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. It also clarifies and simplifies other aspects of the accounting for income taxes. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12 on a prospective basis effective October 1, 2021. The adoption of ASU 2019-12 did not impact our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nRecent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted: We have reviewed all recently issued accounting pronouncements and have determined that such standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our financial statements or do not otherwise apply to our operations.\nNote 2 - Sale of PREBOOST\u00ae Business\nOn December 8, 2020, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Company sold substantially all of the assets related to the Company's PREBOOST business. PREBOOST is a 4% benzocaine medicated individual wipe for the treatment of premature ejaculation. The transaction closed on December 8, 2020. The purchase price for the transaction was $20.0 million, consisting of $15.0 million paid at closing, a $2.5 million note receivable due 12 months after closing and a $2.5 million note receivable due 18 months after closing. The Company collected the final $5.0 million due on the notes receivable during fiscal 2022. Total assets sold, consisting of intangible assets, had a net book value of approximately $1.6 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain on sale of approximately $18.4 million. The Company had income before income taxes of $327,000 during fiscal 2021 related to the PREBOOST business before the sale.\nNote 3 - Fair Value Measurements\nFASB ASC Topic 820 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions.\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\nLevel 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.\nLevel 3 - Instruments with primarily unobservable value drivers.\nThere were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during fiscal 2022 and 2021.\nAmounts capitalized as IPR&D are subject to impairment testing until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. We use probability-adjusted discounted cash flow calculations using Level 3 fair value measurements and inputs including estimated revenues, costs, probability of technical and regulatory success and discount rates to measure impairment, if any.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Companys financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, which consisted of embedded derivatives, are also classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nThe Company determines the fair value of hybrid instruments based on available market data using appropriate valuation models, considering all of the rights and obligations of each instrument. The Company estimates the fair value of hybrid instruments using various techniques (and combinations thereof) that are considered to be consistent with the objective of measuring fair value. In selecting the appropriate technique, the Company considers, among other factors, the nature of the instrument, the market risks that it embodies and the expected means of settlement. Estimating the fair value of derivative financial instruments requires the development of significant and subjective estimates that may, and are likely to, change over the duration of the instrument with related changes in internal and external market factors. Increases in fair value during a given financial quarter result in the recognition of non-cash derivative expense. Conversely, decreases in fair value during a given financial quarter would result in the recognition of non-cash derivative income.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending liability balance associated with embedded derivatives measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021:\nBeginning balance\n$\n7,851,000\n$\n4,182,000\nChange in fair value of derivative liabilities\n(3,557,000)\n3,669,000\nEnding balance\n$\n4,294,000\n$\n7,851,000\nThe expense or income associated with the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives is presented as a separate line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nThe liabilities associated with embedded derivatives represent the fair value of the change of control provisions in the Credit Agreement and Residual Royalty Agreement. See Note 9 for additional information. There is no current observable market for these types of derivatives. The Company previously determined the fair value of the embedded derivatives using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Since the Credit Agreement has been satisfied as of September 30, 2021, the fair value of the embedded derivative within the Residual Royalty Agreement has been calculated by using a scenario-based method, whereby different scenarios are valued and probability weighted. The Company determined that with only the embedded derivative under the Residual Royalty Agreement remaining, there is no material difference between these two valuation models. The scenario-based valuation model incorporates transaction details such as the contractual terms of the instrument and assumptions including projected FC2 revenues, expected cash outflows, probability and estimated dates of a change of control, risk-free interest rates and applicable credit risk. Material changes in any of these inputs could result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement at future reporting dates, which could have a material effect on our results of operations. The decrease in the fair value of derivative liabilities in fiscal 2022 was driven by a decrease in the expected cash outflows under the Residual Royalty Agreement, due to decreases in projected FC2 net revenues in future periods, and increases in the discount rates used, due primarily to external market factors. The increase in fiscal 2021 was driven by an increase in projected FC2 net revenues in future periods and decreases in the discount rates used.\nThe following tables present quantitative information about the inputs and valuation methodologies used to determine the fair value of the embedded derivatives classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as of September 30, 2022 and 2021:\nValuation Methodology\nSignificant Unobservable Input\nScenario-Based\nEstimated change of control dates\nSeptember 2023 to September 2025\nDiscount rate\n13.6% to 14.2%\nProbability of change of control\n20% to 90%\nValuation Methodology\nSignificant Unobservable Input\nMonte Carlo Simulation\nEstimated change of control dates\nSeptember 2022 to September 2025\nDiscount rate\n6.6% to 7.9%\nProbability of change of control\n20% to 90%\nNote 4 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nThe Company generates nearly all its revenue from direct product sales. Revenue from direct product sales is generally recognized when the customer obtains control of the product, which occurs at a point in time, and may be upon shipment or upon delivery based on the contractual shipping terms of a contract. Sales taxes and other similar taxes that the Company collects concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue.\nThe amount of consideration the Company ultimately receives varies depending upon sales discounts, and other incentives that the Company may offer, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. The estimate of variable consideration requires significant judgment. The Company includes estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely upon an assessment of current contract sales terms and historical payment experience.\nProduct returns are typically not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt.\nThe Companys revenue is primarily from sales of FC2 in the U.S. prescription channel and direct sales of FC2 in the global public health sector, and also included sales of PREBOOST\u00ae medicated wipes for the treatment of premature ejaculation through the date the PREBOOST\u00ae business was sold on December 8, 2020. ENTADFI, which was made available for commercial sale in August 2022, is currently being distributed in the U.S. through pharmaceutical distribution channels. The Company recognized net revenues related to ENTADFI beginning in September 2022. The following table presents net revenues by product and sector for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021:\nFC2\nU.S. prescription channel\n$\n30,223,079\n$\n46,470,448\nGlobal public health sector\n9,128,858\n13,926,249\nTotal FC2\n39,351,937\n60,396,697\nOther\n2,415\n862,831\nNet revenues\n$\n39,354,352\n$\n61,259,528\nThe following table presents net revenue by geographic area for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021:\nUnited States\n$\n31,430,235\n$\n48,938,821\nOther\n7,924,117\n12,320,707\nNet revenues\n$\n39,354,352\n$\n61,259,528\nThe Companys performance obligations consist mainly of transferring control of products identified in the contracts which occurs either when: i) the product is made available to the customer for shipment; ii) the product is shipped via common carrier; or iii) the product is delivered to the customer or distributor, in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Some of the Companys contracts require the customer to make advanced payments prior to transferring control of the products. These advanced payments create a contract liability for the Company. The balances of the Companys contract liability, included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balances sheets, was approximately $342,000 and $132,000 at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe amount of revenue recognized that was included in the contract liabilities and unearned revenues balance at the beginning of the period was $130,000 and $6,000 during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, after satisfying its contract obligations and transferring control.\nNote 5 - Accounts Receivable and Concentration of Credit Risk\nThe Companys standard credit terms vary from 30 to 120 days, depending on the class of trade and customary terms within a territory, so accounts receivable is affected by the mix of sales within the period. As is typical in the Companys business, extended credit terms may occasionally be offered as a sales promotion or for certain sales. For sales to the Companys distributor in Brazil, the Company has agreed to credit terms of up to 90 days subsequent to clearance of the product by the Ministry of Health in Brazil. The Company classified approximately $0.7 million of trade receivables with its distributor in Brazil as long-term as of September 30, 2022, because payment was expected in greater than one year. The long-term portion of trade receivables is included in other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.\nThe components of accounts receivable consist of the following at September 30, 2022 and 2021:\nTrade receivables, gross\n$\n4,289,892\n$\n8,938,849\nLess: allowance for doubtful accounts\n(12,143)\n(20,643)\nLess: allowance for sales returns and payment term discounts\n(12,854)\n(123,982)\nLess: long-term trade receivables*\n(714,000)\n-\nAccounts receivable, net\n$\n3,550,895\n$\n8,794,224\n*Included in other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nNo customer had a current accounts receivable balance that represented 10% of current assets at September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nAt September 30, 2022, two customers had an accounts receivable balance greater than 10% of net accounts receivable and long-term trade receivables, representing 83% of net accounts receivable and long-term trade receivables in the aggregate. At September 30, 2021, three customers had an accounts receivable balance greater than 10% of net accounts receivable, representing 90% of the Companys net accounts receivable in the aggregate.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, there were two customers whose individual net revenue to the Company exceeded 10% of the Companys net revenues, representing 73% of the Companys net revenues in the aggregate. For the year ended September 30, 2021, there were two customers whose individual net revenue to the Company exceeded 10% of the Companys net revenues, representing 75% of the Companys net revenues in the aggregate.\nThe Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments on accounts receivable. Management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by identifying troubled accounts and by using historical experience applied to an aging of accounts. Management also periodically evaluates individual customer receivables and considers a customers financial condition, credit history, and the current economic conditions. Accounts receivable are charged-off when deemed uncollectible.

On and subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Lenders provided the Company with a term loan of $10.0 million, which was advanced to the Company on the date of the Credit Agreement. After payment by the Company of certain fees and expenses of the Agent and the Lenders as required in the Credit Agreement, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $9.9 million from the $10.0 million loan under the Credit Agreement.\nThe Lenders were entitled to receive quarterly payments on the term loan based on the Companys product revenue from net sales of FC2 as provided in the Credit Agreement until the Company paid 176.5% of the aggregate amount advanced to the Company under the Credit Agreement. The Company repaid the loan and return premium specified in the Credit Agreement in August 2021, and as a result has no further obligations under the Credit Agreement.\nIn connection with the Credit Agreement, the Company and the Agent also entered into a Residual Royalty Agreement, dated as of March 5, 2018 (as amended, the Residual Royalty Agreement), which provides for an ongoing royalty payment of 5% of product revenue from net sales of FC2, which commenced after the Company paid 175% of the aggregate amount advanced to the Company under the Credit Agreement based on a calculation of revenue-based payments under the Credit Agreement. The Residual Royalty Agreement will terminate upon (i) a change of control or sale of the FC2 business and the payment by the Company of the amount due in connection therewith pursuant to the Credit Agreement, or (ii) mutual agreement of the parties. If a change of control or sale of the FC2 business occurs, the Agent will receive a payment that is the greater of (A) $2.0 million or (B) the product of (x) 5% of the product revenue from net sales of FC2 for the most recently completed 12-month period multiplied by (y) five.\nFor accounting purposes, the $10.0 million advance under the Credit Agreement was allocated between the Credit Agreement and the Residual Royalty Agreement on a relative fair value basis. A portion of the amount allocated to the Credit Agreement and a portion of the amount allocated to the Residual Royalty Agreement, in both cases equal to the fair value of the respective change of control provisions, was allocated to the embedded derivative liabilities. The derivative liabilities are adjusted to fair market value at each reporting period. For financial statement presentation, the embedded derivative liabilities have been included with their respective host instruments as noted in the following tables. The debt discounts, which totaled $11.3 million, were amortized to interest expense over the expected term of the loan using the effective interest method. Additionally, the Company recorded deferred loan issuance costs of approximately $267,000 for legal fees incurred in connection with the Credit Agreement. The deferred loan issuance costs were presented as a reduction of the Credit Agreement obligation and were amortized to interest expense over the expected term of the loan using the effective interest method.\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Residual Royalty Agreement liability consisted of the following:\nResidual royalty agreement liability, fair value at inception\n$\n346,000\n$\n346,000\nAdd: accretion of liability using effective interest rate\n9,950,908\n5,582,110\nLess: cumulative payments\n(3,765,372)\n(1,144,763)\nResidual royalty agreement liability, excluding embedded derivative liability\n6,531,536\n4,783,347\nAdd: embedded derivative liability at fair value (see Note 3)\n4,294,000\n7,851,000\nTotal residual royalty agreement liability\n10,825,536\n12,634,347\nResidual royalty agreement liability, short-term portion\n(1,169,095)\n(3,237,211)\nResidual royalty agreement liability, long-term portion\n$\n9,656,441\n$\n9,397,136\nAs the Company has repaid the original principal of $10.0 million advanced in connection with the Credit Agreement and the Residual Royalty Agreement, payments under the Residual Royalty Agreement are classified as interest payments and included in operating activities on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The short-term portion of the Residual Royalty Agreement liability represents the aggregate of the estimated quarterly royalty payments payable during the 12-month period subsequent to the balance sheet dates.\nInterest expense related to the Credit Agreement and the Residual Royalty Agreement consisted of amortization of the discounts, accretion of the liability for the Residual Royalty Agreement and amortization of the deferred issuance costs. For the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, interest expense related to the Credit Agreement and Residual Royalty Agreement was as follows:\nAmortization of discounts\n$\n-\n$\n1,459,330\nAccretion of residual royalty agreement\n4,368,798\n3,392,423\nAmortization of deferred issuance costs\n-\n34,301\nInterest expense\n$\n4,368,798\n$\n4,886,054\nPremium Finance Agreement\nOn November 1, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement to finance $1.1 million of its directors and officers liability insurance premium at an annual percentage rate of 3.94%.

All of the shares sold in the offering were by the Company. The offering was made pursuant to the Companys shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-239493).\nCommon Stock Purchase Warrants\nIn connection with the closing of the APP Acquisition, the Company issued warrants to purchase up to 2,585,379 shares of the Company's common stock to Torreya Capital, the Company's financial advisor (the Financial Advisor Warrants).

Concurrently with entering into the 2020 Purchase Agreement, the Company also entered into a registration rights agreement with Aspire Capital (the Registration Rights Agreement), in which the Company agreed to prepare and file under the Securities Act of 1933 one or more prospectus supplement for the sale or potential sale of the shares of the Companys common stock that have been and may be issued to Aspire Capital under the 2020 Purchase Agreement.\nUnder the 2020 Purchase Agreement, on any trading day selected by the Company, the Company has the right, in its sole discretion, to present Aspire Capital with a purchase notice (each, a Purchase Notice), directing Aspire Capital (as principal) to purchase up to 200,000 shares of the Companys common stock per business day at a per share price (the Purchase Price) equal to the lesser of the lowest sale price of the Companys common stock on the purchase date or the average of the three lowest closing sale prices for the Companys common stock during the ten consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the purchase date.\nIn addition, on any date on which the Company submits a Purchase Notice to Aspire Capital in an amount equal to 200,000 shares and the closing sale price of our common stock is equal to or greater than $0.50 per share, the Company also has the right, in its sole discretion, to present Aspire Capital with a volume-weighted average price purchase notice (each, a VWAP Purchase Notice) directing Aspire Capital to purchase an amount of common stock equal to up to 30% of the aggregate shares of the common stock traded on its principal market on the next trading day (the VWAP Purchase Date), subject to a maximum number of shares the Company may determine. The purchase price per share pursuant to such VWAP Purchase Notice is generally 97% of the volume-weighted average price for the Companys common stock traded on its principal market on the VWAP Purchase Date.\nIn consideration for entering into the 2020 Purchase Agreement, concurrently with the execution of the 2020 Purchase Agreement, the Company issued to Aspire Capital 212,130 shares of the Companys common stock. The shares of common stock issued as consideration were valued at $681,000, based on the closing price per share of the Companys common stock on the date the shares were issued. This amount and related expenses of $50,000, which total approximately $731,000, were recorded as deferred costs.\nUpon execution of the 2020 Purchase Agreement, the Company issued and sold 1,644,737 shares of common stock to Aspire Capital under the 2020 Purchase Agreement, resulting in proceeds to the Company of $5 million. There was no activity under the 2020 Purchase Agreement in fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021. The unamortized amount of deferred costs related to the 2020 Purchase Agreement of $578,000 at September 30, 2022 and 2021 is included in other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2022, the amount remaining under the 2020 Purchase Agreement is $18.9 million, which is registered under the Companys 2020 shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-239493).\nNote 11 - Share-based Compensation\nWe allocate share-based compensation expense to cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expense and research and development expense based on the award holders employment function. We recorded income tax benefits for share-based compensation expense of approximately $2.5 million and $1.1 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. For fiscal 2022 and 2021, we recorded share-based compensation expenses as follows:\nCost of sales\n$\n328,225\n$\n65,165\nSelling, general and administrative\n8,151,505\n3,629,732\nResearch and development\n2,762,693\n1,355,492\n$\n11,242,423\n$\n5,050,389\nWe have issued share-based awards to employees and non-executive directors under the Companys approved equity plans. Upon the exercise of share-based awards, new shares are issued from authorized common stock.\nEquity Plans\nOn June 16, 2022, the Companys board of directors adopted the Companys 2022 Employment Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (the Inducement Plan). The Inducement Plan is a non-shareholder approved stock plan adopted pursuant to the inducement exception provided under Nasdaq listing rules. The Inducement Plan is used exclusively for the issuance of equity awards to new hires who satisfy the requirements to be granted inducement grants under Nasdaq listing rules as an inducement material to the individuals entry into employment with the Company. The terms of the Inducement Plan are substantially similar to the terms of our 2018 Plan. The Company has reserved 4,000,000 shares of common stock under the Inducement Plan and as of September 30, 2022, 3,635,350 shares remain available for issuance.\nIn March 2018, the Companys stockholders approved the Company's 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2018 Plan). On March 29, 2022, the Companys stockholders approved an increase in the number of shares that may be issued under the 2018 Plan to 18.5 million. As of September 30, 2022, 6,534,734 shares remain available for issuance under the 2018 Plan.\nIn July 2017, the Companys stockholders approved the Company's 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2017 Plan). A total of 4.7 million shares are authorized for issuance under the 2017 Plan. As of September 30, 2022, 18,767 shares remain available for issuance under the 2017 Plan. The 2017 Plan replaced the Company's 2008 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2008 Plan), and no further awards will be made under the 2008 Plan.\nStock Options\nEach option grants the holder the right to purchase from us one share of our common stock at a specified price, which is generally the closing price per share of our common stock on the date the option is issued. Options generally vest on a pro-rata basis on each anniversary of the issuance date within three years of the date the option is issued. Options may be exercised after they have vested and prior to the specified expiry date provided applicable exercise conditions are met, if any. The expiry date can be for periods of up to ten years from the date the option is issued. The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the assumptions established at that time. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur and does not estimate forfeitures as of the option grant date.\nThe following table outlines the weighted average assumptions for options granted during fiscal 2022 and 2021:\nWeighted Average Assumptions:\nExpected Volatility\n84.53%\n69.68%\nExpected Dividend Yield\n0.00%\n0.00%\nRisk-free Interest Rate\n2.17%\n0.67%\nExpected Term (in years)\n6.0\n5.9\nFair Value of Options Granted\n$\n7.10\n$\n3.58\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company used historical volatility of our common stock over a period equal to the expected life of the options to estimate their fair value. The dividend yield assumption is based on the Companys recent history and expectation of future dividend payouts on the common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term.\nThe following table summarizes the stock options outstanding and exercisable at September 30, 2022:\nWeighted Average\nRemaining\nAggregate\nNumber of\nExercise Price\nContractual Term\nIntrinsic\nShares\nPer Share\n(years)\nValue\nOutstanding at September 30, 2021\n10,600,680\n$\n2.84\nGranted\n4,494,615\n9.79\nExercised\n(539,146)\n2.00\nForfeited\n(292,679)\n5.64\nOutstanding at September 30, 2022\n14,263,470\n$\n5.00\n7.30\n$\n96,040,469\nExercisable at September 30, 2022\n7,763,554\n$\n2.22\n6.04\n$\n72,896,243\nThe aggregate intrinsic values in the table above are before income taxes and represent the number of in-the-money options outstanding or exercisable multiplied by the closing price per share of the Companys common stock on the last trading day of the year ended September 30, 2022 of $11.52, less the respective weighted average exercise price per share at period end.\nThe total intrinsic value of options exercised was approximately $8.1 million and $9.2 million during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Cash received from options exercised was $1.1 million and $1.8 million in the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company had unrecognized compensation expense of approximately $29.7 million related to unvested stock options. This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.9 years.\nDuring fiscal 2022 and 2021, the Company modified stock options held by certain optionees upon termination of their employment by the Company or resignation from the board of directors. As permitted under the 2018 Plan, the stock options were primarily modified to accelerate vesting or to allow for continued vesting. The aggregate amount of expense recognized in connection with these modifications was approximately $1.0 million and $550,000 during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nStock Appreciation Rights\nIn fiscal 2017, the Company issued stock appreciation rights based on 50,000 shares of the Companys common stock to an employee that vested on October 31, 2018. The stock appreciation rights have a ten-year term and an exercise price per share of $0.95. Upon exercise, the stock appreciation rights will be settled in common stock issued under the 2017 Plan. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, vested stock appreciation rights based on 50,000 shares of common stock remain outstanding.\nNote 12 - Leases\nThe Company has operating leases for its office, manufacturing and warehouse space, and office equipment. The Company has a finance lease for office equipment, furniture, and fixtures.\nCorporate Headquarters\nIn June 2021, the Company executed a lease for its new corporate headquarters in Miami, Florida. The Company is leasing approximately 12,000 square feet of office space for an eight year term, which commenced on March 1, 2022. The space replaced the Companys previous corporate headquarters in Miami, Florida when the lease terminated at the end of February 2022. Annual base rent payments are $58.00 per square foot and are subject to a 3% annual escalation. Based on the terms of the lease agreement, the Company paid a security deposit of approximately $117,000, which is included in other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nChicago Lease\nThe Company leases approximately 6,600 square feet of office space located in Chicago, Illinois. The Company executed the lease for this office in May 2016, for a seven-year period commencing on November 1, 2016 and ending on October 31, 2023. The lease granted the Company a seven-month lease holiday beginning November 1, 2016, a five-month lease abatement beginning June 1, 2017, and provided a tenant improvement allowance. Annual base rent payments were $14.00 per square foot in year one and increase on an annual basis to $17 per square foot in the final year of the lease. The lease also requires payment of related expenses, including real estate taxes, common area maintenance, utilities and insurance expenses from June 1, 2017 to October 31, 2023. Based on the terms of the lease agreement, the Company paid a security deposit of $55,000. Effective September 1, 2017, the Company entered into a sublease for this office space through October 31, 2023. Monthly sublease payments of approximately $15,200 commenced in January 2018 and will end in August 2023. The monthly sublease payment is subject to annual increases in September of each year and will increase to approximately $17,300 per month in the final year of the sublease. Sublease income is recognized as a reduction to operating lease costs as the sublease is outside of the Companys normal business operations. This is consistent with the Companys recognition of sublease income prior to the adoption of FASB ASC Topic 842. The tenant under the sublease provided a security deposit of $30,000 to the Company. The Company continues to be responsible for performance under the lease until it expires on October 31, 2023.\nInternational Leases\nThe Company leases approximately 6,400 square feet of office space located in London, England. The lease was effective in August 2020 with a five year term and a tenants option to cancel after three years with no penalty to the Company.

The Company had an option to extend the term of the lease for a period of three years, which was executed so that the lease is effective through August 31, 2025. The lease requires monthly payments of approximately $15,400. Based on the terms of the lease agreement, the Company maintains a security deposit of approximately $46,000.\nCertain of our lease agreements include variable lease payments for common area maintenance, real estate taxes, and insurance or based on usage for the office equipment leases. The components of the Companys lease cost were as follows for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021:\nFinance lease cost:\nAmortization of right-of-use assets\n$\n3,631\n$\n8,731\nInterest on lease liabilities\n2,765\nOperating lease cost\n883,928\n542,751\nShort-term lease cost\n46,117\n44,347\nVariable lease cost\n211,840\n178,527\nSublease income\n(179,378)\n(179,378)\nTotal lease cost\n$\n966,541\n$\n597,743\nThe Company paid cash of $680,000 and $650,000 for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities during the year ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The Company maintains product liability insurance coverage for claims arising from the use of its products. The coverage amount is currently $30.0 million.\nLitigation\nFrom time to time we may be involved in litigation or other contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. Based on the information presently available, management believes there are no contingencies, claims or actions, pending or threatened, the ultimate resolution of which will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\nIn accordance with FASB ASC 450, Contingencies, we accrue loss contingencies including costs of settlement, damages and defense related to litigation to the extent they are probable and reasonably estimable. Otherwise, we expense these costs as incurred. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we accrue the minimum amount of the range.\nLicense and Purchase Agreements\nFrom time to time, we license or purchase rights to technology or intellectual property from third parties. These licenses and purchase agreements require us to pay upfront payments as well as development or other payments upon successful completion of preclinical, clinical, regulatory or revenue milestones. In addition, these agreements may require us to pay royalties on sales of products arising from the licensed or acquired technology or intellectual property. Because the achievement of future milestones is not reasonably estimable, we have not recorded a liability in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for any of these contingencies.\nCollaborative Arrangements\nOn January 31, 2022, the Company entered into a Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement (the Lilly Agreement) with Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly). Under the Lilly Agreement, the Company is sponsoring a clinical trial in which both the Companys enobosarm compound and Lillys compound are being dosed in combination. The Company is conducting the research at its own cost and Lilly is contributing its compound towards the study at no cost to the Company. The parties will continue to hold exclusive rights to all intellectual property relating solely to their own respective compounds. The Company will provide to Lilly copies of clinical data relating to the clinical trial and certain rights to use the clinical data. Veru maintains full exclusive, global commercialization rights to the enobosarm compound.\nThe terms of the Lilly Agreement meet the criteria under ASC Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements (ASC 808), as both parties are active participants in the activity and are exposed to the risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activity. ASC 808 does not provide guidance on how to account for the activities under the collaboration, and the Company determined that Lilly did not meet the definition of a customer under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company has concluded that ASC 730, Research and Development, should be applied by analogy. There is no financial statement impact for the Lilly Agreement as the value of the drug supply received from Lilly is offset against the drug supply cost within research and development expense.\nNote 14 - Income Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax-effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of its assets and liabilities, and for net operating loss (NOL) and tax credit carryforwards.\nWithin the calculation of the Companys annual effective tax rate the Company has used assumptions and estimates that may change as a result of future guidance, interpretations, and rule-making from the Internal Revenue Service, the SEC, the FASB and/or various other taxing jurisdictions. For example, the Company anticipates that state jurisdictions will continue to determine and announce their conformity to the Tax Act which would have an impact on the annual effective tax rate. The Companys calculations are based on the information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail.\nThe Company completes a detailed analysis of its deferred income tax valuation allowances on an annual basis or more frequently if information comes to its attention that would indicate that a revision to its estimates is necessary. In evaluating the Companys ability to realize its deferred tax assets, management considers all available positive and negative evidence on a country-by-country basis, including past operating results, forecasts of future taxable income, and the potential Section 382 limitation on the NOL carryforwards due to a change in control. In determining future taxable income, management makes assumptions to forecast U.S. federal and state, U.K. and Malaysia operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment regarding the forecasts of the future taxable income in each tax jurisdiction and are consistent with the forecasts used to manage the Companys business. The Company had a cumulative pretax loss in the U.S. for fiscal 2022 and the two preceding fiscal years. Forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is significant negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years. Management has projected future pretax losses in the U.S. driven by the investment in research and development and based on our analysis, concluded that a full valuation allowance should be recorded related to federal and state NOL carryforwards as of September 30, 2022. The valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets was increased by $25.8 million during the year ended September 30, 2022. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021 respectively, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $42.2 million and $16.4 million against U.S. deferred tax assets. In addition, the Companys U.K. holding company for the non-U.S. operating companies, The Female Health Company Limited, continues to have a full valuation allowance of $3.2 million as of September 30, 2022 and 2021. The operating U.K. subsidiary, The Female Health Company (UK) plc does not have a valuation allowance due to projections of future taxable income. Veru Biopharma UK Limited has a full valuation allowance of $49,000.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company had U.S. federal and state NOL carryforwards of approximately $112.5 million and $50.9 million, respectively, for income tax purposes with $29.7 million and $28.4 million, respectively, expiring in fiscal years 2023 to 2042 and $82.8 million and $22.5 million, respectively, which can be carried forward indefinitely. The Company also has U.S. federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of $8.5 million, expiring in fiscal years 2038 to 2042. The Companys U.K. subsidiary and Veru Biopharma UK Limited have U.K. NOL carryforwards of approximately $63.1 million as of September 30, 2022, which can be carried forward indefinitely to be used to offset future U.K. taxable income.\n(Loss) income before income taxes was taxed by the following jurisdictions for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021:\nDomestic\n$\n(82,186,464)\n$\n4,822,626\nForeign\n(1,353,159)\n(557,390)\nTotal\n$\n(83,539,623)\n$\n4,265,236\nA reconciliation between the effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate and the related income tax expense (benefit) is as follows:\nAmount\nTax Rate\nAmount\nTax Rate\nIncome tax (benefit) expense at U.S. federal statutory rates\n$\n(17,543,321)\n21.0\n%\n$\n895,699\n21.0\n%\nState income tax (benefit) expense, net of federal benefits\n(1,358,354)\n1.6\n69,353\n1.6\nEffect of change in U.K. tax rate\n-\n-\n(3,746,247)\n(87.8)\nNon-deductible expenses - other\n76,913\n(0.1)\n137,003\n3.2\nU.S. research and development tax credit\n(5,720,374)\n6.9\n(2,761,415)\n(64.7)\nEffect of foreign income tax rates\n409,048\n(0.5)\n461,177\n10.8\nEffect of common stock options and warrants exercised\n(1,580,756)\n1.9\n(3,848,412)\n(90.2)\nEffect of Paycheck Protection Program funds\n-\n-\n(113,442)\n(2.7)\nEffect of global intangible low-taxed income\n24,691\n(0.0)\n219,167\n5.1\nChange in valuation allowance\n25,792,441\n(30.9)\n5,505,271\n129.1\nOther, net\n136,109\n(0.2)\n52,708\n1.2\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n$\n236,397\n(0.3)\n%\n$\n(3,129,138)\n(73.4)\n%\nOn June 10, 2021, the U.K. Finance Act 2021 was enacted increasing the U.K. tax rate from 19% to 25% effective April 1, 2023. The increase in the tax rate increased the value of the deferred tax assets in the U.K. by $3.7 million with a corresponding valuation allowance of $0.7 million, which resulted in a net income tax benefit of $3.0 million during the year ended September 30, 2021.\nThe federal and state income tax expense (benefit) for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 is summarized below:\nDeferred - U.K.\n$\n(42,089)\n$\n(3,457,096)\nDeferred - Malaysia\n118,295\n(111,952)\nSubtotal\n76,206\n(3,569,048)\nCurrent - U.S.\n126,079\n51,880\nCurrent - Malaysia\n34,112\n388,030\nSubtotal\n160,191\n439,910\nIncome tax benefit\n$\n236,397\n$\n(3,129,138)\nSignificant components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nDeferred tax assets:\nFederal net operating loss carryforwards\n$\n23,627,461\n$\n8,209,224\nState net operating loss carryforwards\n2,850,956\n1,646,827\nForeign net operating loss carryforwards - U.K.\n15,773,497\n15,875,889\nForeign capital allowance - U.K.\n128,490\n117,709\nU.K. bad debts\n-\n2,500\nShare-based compensation - U.K.\n265,631\n80,844\nU.S. research and development tax credit carryforward\n8,481,789\n2,761,415\nU.S. deferred rent\n81,507\n31,034\nAccrued compensation\n1,227,290\n156,121\nShare-based compensation\n4,325,354\n2,071,838\nInterest expense\n2,206,484\n1,368,042\nChange in fair value of derivative liability\n220,607\n1,025,425\nOther, net - Malaysia\n-\n100,654\nOther, net - U.S.\n-\n16,082\nGross deferred tax assets\n59,189,066\n33,463,604\nValuation allowance for deferred tax assets\n(45,372,452)\n(19,580,011)\nNet deferred tax assets\n13,816,614\n13,883,593\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nIn process research and development\n(882,427)\n(882,427)\nCovenant not-to-compete\n(17,508)\n(33,671)\nOther, net - Malaysia\n(17,641)\n-\nOther\n(14,120)\n(6,371)\nNet deferred tax liabilities\n(931,696)\n(922,469)\nNet deferred tax asset\n$\n12,884,918\n$\n12,961,124\nThe deferred tax amounts have been classified in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as follows:\nLong-term deferred tax asset - U.K.\n$\n12,965,985\n$\n12,923,896\nLong-term deferred tax asset - Malaysia\n-\n100,654\nTotal long-term deferred tax asset\n$\n12,965,985\n$\n13,024,550\nLong-term deferred tax liability - U.S.\n$\n(63,426)\n$\n(63,426)\nLong-term deferred tax liability - Malaysia\n(17,641)\n-\nTotal long-term deferred tax liability\n$\n(81,067)\n$\n(63,426)\nASC Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC Topic 740 developed a two-step process to evaluate a tax position and also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The Company has not recorded a reserve for any tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility.\nThe Company files tax returns in all appropriate jurisdictions, including foreign, U.S. federal and state tax returns. The following summarizes open tax years in the relevant jurisdictions:\n\uf0b7For the U.S., a tax return may be audited any time within 3 years from filing date. The U.S. open tax years are for fiscal 2019 through 2021, which expire in years 2023 through 2025, respectively.\n\uf0b7For Malaysia, a tax return may be audited any time within 5 years from filing date (7 months after the fiscal year end). The Malaysia open tax years are for 2017 through 2021, which expire on December 31, 2022 through 2026.\n\uf0b7For the U.K., a tax return may be audited within 1 year from the later of: the filing date or the filing deadline (1 year after the end of the accounting period). The U.K. open tax year is for 2021, which expires in 2023.\nThe fiscal 2022 tax returns for all jurisdiction have not been filed as of the date of this filing. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company has no recorded liability for unrecognized tax benefits.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as income tax expense as incurred. No expense for interest and penalties was recognized for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nNote 15 - Net (Loss) Income Per Share\nBasic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net (loss) income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net (loss) income per share is computed by dividing net (loss) income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period after giving effect to all dilutive potential common shares that were outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common shares consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options, stock appreciation rights and common stock purchase warrants as determined under the treasury stock method.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the net (loss) income per basic and diluted common share outstanding:\nNet (loss) income\n$\n(83,776,020)\n$\n7,394,374\nBasic weighted average common shares outstanding\n80,122,526\n76,272,853\nNet effect of dilutive instruments:\nStock options\n-\n7,151,070\nStock appreciation rights\n-\n44,291\nCommon stock purchase warrants\n-\n334,206\nTotal net effect of dilutive instruments\n-\n7,529,567\nDiluted weighted average common shares outstanding\n80,122,526\n83,802,420\nNet (loss) income per basic common share outstanding\n$\n(1.05)\n$\n0.10\nNet (loss) income per diluted common share outstanding\n$\n(1.05)\n$\n0.09\nFor the year ended September 30, 2021, approximately 1.2 million potentially dilutive instruments were excluded from the computation of net income per diluted weighted average common share outstanding because their effect would have been antidilutive. Due to our net loss for the year ended September 30, 2022, all potentially dilutive instruments were excluded because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. See Notes 10 and 11 for a discussion of these potentially dilutive instruments.\nNote 16 - Employee Benefit Plans\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company established a 401(k) plan in which substantially all U.S. employees are eligible to participate. Contributions made by employees are limited to the maximum allowable for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Company matches employee contributions at a rate of 100% of applicable contributions up to 4% of included compensation. Effective January 1, 2022, this contribution amount was increased to 6%. Company contributions to the 401(k) plan were approximately $461,000 and $207,000 for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nIn March 2014, the Company elected to contribute 3% of eligible employee compensation into the personal pension schemes of certain senior U.K. employees. Effective January 1, 2019, this contribution amount was increased to 4%. Company contributions were approximately $41,000 and $40,000 for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively."
