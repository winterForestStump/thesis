    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS.\nOverview\nWe are focused on the development and commercialization of proprietary sensor technologies which, when paired with our artificial intelligence, or AI, deep learning platform, are capable of uniquely identifying and measuring almost any material or analyte using electromagnetic energy to detect, record, identify and measure the unique signature of said materials or analytes. We call this our Bio-RFID technology platform, when pertaining to radio and microwave spectroscopy, and our ChromaID technology platform, when pertaining to optical spectroscopy. The data obtained with our sensor technology is analyzed with our trade secret algorithms which are driven by our AI deep learning platform.\nChromaID was the first technology developed and patented by our company. For the past several years, we have focused on extensions and new patentable inventions that are derived from and extend beyond our ChromaID technology and intellectual property. The rapid advances made with our Bio-RFID technology in our laboratory have caused us to move quickly into the commercialization phase of our company as we work to create revenue generating products for the marketplace. Today, the primary focus of our company is on our Bio-RFID technology and our commercialization and development of related patent assets. Through our wholly owned subsidiaries, we work to exploit additional opportunities and markets that our broad intellectual property and trade secret portfolio addresses.\nCorporate History and Structure\nKnow Labs, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in 1998. Since 2007, our company has been focused primarily on research and development of proprietary spectroscopic technologies spanning the electromagnetic spectrum.\nOn April 30, 2020, we incorporated Particle, Inc., or Particle, as a wholly-owned subsidiary in the State of Nevada. Particle focused on the development and commercialization of our extensive intellectual property relating to electromagnetic energy outside of the medical diagnostic arena which remains the parent companys singular focus.\nOn September 17, 2021, we incorporated of AI Mind, Inc., or AI Mind, as a wholly-owned subsidiary in the State of Nevada. AI Mind is focused on monetizing the AI deep learning platform.\nThe Know Labs Technology\nWe have internally and under contract with third parties developed proprietary platform technologies to uniquely identify and measure almost any organic and inorganic material or analyte. Our patented technology utilizes electromagnetic energy along a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum from visible light and infrared to radio and microwave wavelengths to perform analytics which allow the user to accurately identify and measure materials and analytes depending upon the specified targets or endpoints and field of use. Our proprietary platform technologies are called Bio-RFID and ChromaID.\nOur technology platform, Bio-RFID, utilizes spectroscopy at higher wavelengths than ChromaIDs optical range to span radio wave and microwave segments of the electromagnetic spectrum. Working in our lab we have developed extensions and new inventions derived in part from our ChromaID technology, which we refer to as Bio-RFID. We believe an important competitive differentiator for Bio-RFID to be its ability to not only identify a wide range of organic and inorganic materials and analytes, but to do so concurrently, and in real time, which potentially enables new multivariate models of clinical diagnostics, and health and wellness monitoring. We are rapidly advancing the development of this technology by increasing its accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. We have announced detailed results confirming that we have successfully been able to non-invasively measure blood glucose levels in humans. Significantly, we believe Bio-RFID successfully addresses the limiting qualities of optical technologies whose diagnostic capacities may be inhibited by skin tones, skin thickness and other factors.\nOur ability to obtain exacting results from the data obtained from our Bio-RFID sensor technology, also referred to as radio frequency spectroscopy or RF spectroscopy, is a consequence of the application of our trade secret algorithms. We have worked for the last several years on the AI and machine learning, or ML, that drives the accurate pattern recognition of our algorithms. This work has led to the development of a robust AI deep learning platform. This AI deep learning platform drives the data pattern recognition for Bio-RFIDs exacting determination of blood glucose levels. It can also provide the data recognition for blood alcohol and blood oxygen levels which we have also identified in preliminary tests. It will provide the analytics for the long list of other analytes in the human body that we will pursue non-invasive detection of, many of which are set forth in our issued patent USPTO 11,033,208 B1. Our AI deep learning platform may be separately monetized through our subsidiary AI Mind.\nWe continue to build the internal and external development team necessary to commercialize our technology as well as make additional patent filings covering the intellectual property created with new inventions. The first applications of our Bio-RFID technology will be in a product marketed as a glucose monitor. It will provide the user with real time information on their blood glucose levels. This product will require US Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, clearance prior to its introduction to the market, which we plan to pursue. We have previously announced two versions of our non-invasive glucose monitoring device. We have identified these as the KnowU and the UBand. The KnowU will be a desk top version with a portable monitoring device for periodic glucose monitoring and the UBand will be a wearable for continuous glucose monitoring.\nWe have also announced the results of internal laboratory-based comparison testing between our Bio-RFID technology and the leading continuous glucose monitors from Abbott Labs (Freestyle Libre) and DexCom (G6). These results provide evidence of a high degree of correlation between our Bio-RFID technology and the current industry leaders and their continuous glucose monitors. Our patented technology is fundamentally differentiated from these industry leaders as our technology completely non-invasively monitors blood glucose levels.\nWe have begun the internal process to pursue FDA approval of our non-invasive blood glucose monitoring device as soon as possible. To guide us in that undertaking, we previously announced the hiring of a Chief Medical Officer and formed a medical and regulatory advisory board to guide us through the FDA process. Additionally, we have retained third party quality assurance and documentation consultants to ensure that the rigorous requirements of the FDA are met. We are unable, however, to estimate the time necessary for FDA approval or the likelihood of success in that endeavor.\nWhile the first focus of our Bio-RFID platform is non-invasive glucose monitoring, it is important to note that our KnowU and the UBand devices have the capacity to monitor and identify other analytes in the human body with a relatively simple software modification. Each additional analyte we identify over time will require its own subsequent FDA approval, the success of which we are unable to estimate at this time.\nOur ChromaID patented technology utilizes light at the photon (elementary particle of light) level through a series of emitters and detectors to generate a unique signature or fingerprint from a scan of almost any solid, liquid or gaseous material. This signature of reflected or transmitted light is digitized, creating a unique ChromaID signature. Each ChromaID signature is comprised of hundreds to thousands of specific data points.\nThe ChromaID technology looks beyond visible light frequencies to areas of near infra-red and ultraviolet light and beyond that are outside the humanly visible light spectrum. The data obtained allows us to create a very specific and unique ChromaID signature of the substance for a myriad of authentication, verification, and identification applications.\nBio-RFID, ChromaID and AI Deep Learning: Foundational Platform Technologies\nOur technologies provide a unique platform upon which a myriad of applications can be developed. As platform technologies, they are analogous to a smartphone, upon which an enormous number of previously unforeseen applications have been developed. Bio-RFID and ChromaID technologies are enabling technologies that bring the science of electromagnetic energy to low-cost, real-world commercialization opportunities across multiple industries. The technologies are foundational and, as such, the basis upon which we believe significant businesses can be built. While we are pursuing our core focus on commercializing our glucose monitor, we believe non-core clinical and non-clinical applications represent a multitude of opportunities for strategic collaboration, joint development and licensing agreements with leading companies in their respective industries.\nAs with other foundational technologies, a single application may reach across multiple industries. Bio-RFID technology can non-invasively identify and monitor changes in the quantity of blood glucose in the human body. By extension, there may be other analytes or molecular structures this same technology can identify in the human body which, over time, we intend to focus on. They may include the monitoring of drug usage or the presence of illicit drugs. They may also involve identifying hormones and various biomarkers of disease or pre-conditions of disease.\nSimilarly, ChromaID technology can, for example, effectively differentiate and identify different brands of clear vodkas that appear identical to the human eye. By extension, this same technology could identify pure water from water with contaminants present. It could provide real time detection of liquid medicines such as morphine that have been adulterated or compromised. It could detect if jet fuel has water contamination present. It could determine when it is time to change oil in a deep fat fryer. These are but a few of the potential applications of ChromaID technology based upon extensions of its ability to identify different liquids.\nThe AI deep learning platform is an enabling technology which can identify patterns from data gathered from both the Bio-RFID and ChromaID platform technologies. The AI deep learning platform is critical to our ability to identify accurately blood glucose levels and other analytes in the human body. Over time, utilizing our AI deep learning platform, we plan to develop analytics which, when using data collected from our sensors, will provide useful information on health and wellness to end users, and potentially lead to what we call Predictive Health. In addition to identifying patterns, the inverse is also possible as our AI deep learning platform can also create patterns in the form of 3D graphical images. That activity has found its first form in the work of our subsidiary, AI Mind, to generate beautiful 3D graphical images which were sold as non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, providing revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. NFT sales from images created by our AI deep learning platform were the result of a one-time successful experiment. We do not expect future activity or revenue from that source.\nProduct Strategy\nWe are currently undertaking internal development work on potential products for the commercial marketplace. We have announced the development of our non-invasive glucose monitor and our desire to obtain FDA clearance for the marketing of this product. We have also announced the engagement of a manufacturing partner we will work with to bring this product to market. We will make further announcements regarding this product as development, testing, manufacturing, and regulatory approval work progresses.\nCurrently, we are focusing our efforts on productizing our Bio-RFID technology as we move it out of our research laboratory, through third party validation studies, appropriate and required clinical trials and into the marketplace. At this point in our development cycle the sensor hardware is completed, the product form factor is nearing completion, and the algorithms which provide accurate results from the data collected by our sensor are in the final development stages.\nOur subsidiary, Particle, continues to seek a strategic distribution partner or partners to move its virus deactivating light bulb into the global marketplace. Our subsidiary, AI Mind, will, over time, look at additional ways to monetize our AI deep learning platform.\nSales and Marketing\nWhile we continue with our internal development efforts and the move toward FDA approved clinical trials and expected (but not guaranteed) clearance of our first product, a non-invasive blood glucose monitoring device, we will explore the several potential avenues for moving our first product and potential follow on products into the marketplace. The avenues being explored include direct to consumer, initial launch partners, broad distribution partners, licensing partners and private label approaches to the market among others. We have begun to build our internal sales and marketing team in preparation for detailed strategic thinking about the optimal approach to the marketplace.\nCompetition\nWe group the competition into three large categories. Those are (i) large global technology companies who may enter the blood glucose monitoring and other medical diagnostic markets, (ii) legacy providers of blood glucose monitoring technology, and (iii) new entrants working to achieve a non-invasive solution or more acceptable blood glucose monitoring solution which may or may not be similar to our technology. With regard to companies in each category, we perform due diligence from all publicly available sources of information on their relevant technologies and their product plans. This information informs and refines our activities and underscores our sense of urgency as we work to bring our own technology to the marketplace. The addressable market is very large and there is room for a multitude of providers of blood glucose monitoring services. Of note, we believe few, if any, of the competitors in the blood glucose monitoring space possess a platform technology competitive with our Bio-RFID technology and our ability to identify a multitude of analytes in the human body.\nCompetitive Advantages\nWe believe our key competitive strengths include:\n\u00b7\nThrough first principles, Bio-RFIDs ability to not only identify a wide range of organic and inorganic materials and analytes, but to do so concurrently, and in real time, which potentially enables new multivariate models of clinical diagnostics, and health and wellness monitoring.\n\u00b7\nOur Bio-RFID technology is non-invasive, using radio waves to identify and measure what is going on inside the body in real-time\n\u00b7\nOur Bio-RFID technology platform can be integrated into a variety of wearable, mobile or counter-top form factors, as well as interoperability with existing products from current market leaders.\n\u00b7\nNo needles nor invasive transmitters in your body, making Bio-RFID sensors convenient and pain-free.\n\u00b7\nNo expensive supplies, such as test strips and lancets, are required to operate Bio-RFID devices.\nGrowth Strategy\nThe key elements of our strategy to grow our business include:\n\u00b7\nInitially, entering the diabetes continuous glucose monitoring market with our non-invasive continuous glucose monitoring products.\n\u00b7\nFollowing our entry into the continuous glucose monitoring market, entering other clinical monitoring markets for continuous, non-invasive hormone, medication metabolite, endocrinology components and biomolecular monitoring.\n\u00b7\nApplying our Bio-RFID platform technology to lifestyle analysis, clinical trials and chronic illnesses. We believe that potential use cases include real time wearable medication monitoring and detection of, for example, ovulation and hormone deficiency.\n\u00b7\nSignificantly, every new application will function utilizing the same sensor. You will not need a new device, simply a new software algorithm.\n\u00b7\nEach new application provides new opportunities for monetization of the Bio-RFID platform technology.\nResearch and Development\nOur current research and development efforts are primarily focused on improving our Bio-RFID technology, extending its capacity, and developing new and unique applications for this technology and the AI deep learning platform that drives its analytics. As part of this effort, we conduct on-going laboratory testing to ensure that application methods are compatible with the end-user and regulatory requirements, and that they can be implemented in a cost-effective manner. We are also actively involved in identifying new applications. Our current internal team along with outside consultants have considerable experience working with the application of our technologies and their application. We engage third party experts as required to supplement our internal team. We believe that continued development of new and enhanced technologies is essential to our future success. We incurred expenses of $5,385,586 and $3,969,972 for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, on development activities.\nOur wholly owned subsidiary, Particle, was focused on the development and commercialization of our extensive intellectual property relating to electromagnetic energy outside of the medical diagnostic arena which remains our singular focus. Since its incorporation, Particle has engaged in research and development activities on threaded light bulbs that have a warm white light and can inactivate germs, including bacteria and viruses. Particle is now looking for partners to commercialize this product.\nOur wholly owned subsidiary, AI Mind, is focused on opportunities to monetize our AI deep learning platform over time. It is unlikely we will repeat the successful experiment with AI created art that sold as NFT in late 2021.We will, however, over time, continue to look for opportunities for new applications on our AI deep learning platform, to generate revenues to support the continued development of our non-invasive diagnostic technology.\nIntellectual Property\nThe cornerstone of our foundational platform technology is our intellectual property portfolio. We have pursued an active intellectual property strategy which includes focus on patents where appropriate and a diligent protection of trade secrets. To date, we have been granted 27 patents and 19 design patents. We currently have a number of patents pending and continue, on a regular basis, with the filing of new patents. We possess all rights, title and interest to the issued patents.\nOur issued patents will expire at various times between 2027 and 2041. Pending patents, if and when issued, may have expiration dates that extend further in time. The duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.\nThe issued patents cover the fundamental aspects of our ChromaID and Bio-RFID technology and a number of unique applications. We have filed patents on the fundamental aspects of our Bio-RFID technology and growing number of unique applications. We will continue, over time, to expand our patent portfolio.\nAdditionally, significant aspects of our technology are maintained as trade secrets which may not be disclosed through the patent filing process. We are diligent in maintaining and securing our trade secrets.\nRelated Patent Assets\nInherent in a platform technology is the ability to develop or license technology in diverse fields of use apart from our core focus. We focus on human health and wellness with a first focus on the non-invasive monitoring of blood glucose. We will pursue the identification of a multitude of analytes in the human body important to diagnostics over time. We will also identify, over time, opportunities for our intellectual property to be deployed in areas outside human health and wellness. Examples are Particle and AI Mind.\nWe expect although we cannot guarantee that we will create other such subsidiaries over time. Additionally, we may license our intellectual property to third parties so that they may pursue activities that are not a part of our core focus.\nEmployees\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had 16 full-time and part employees. Our senior management and other personnel are located in our Seattle, Washington offices. We periodically utilize consulting firms and individual contractors to supplement our workforce.\nGovernment Regulation\nUnited States\nOur medical diagnostic products and operations, initially the KnowU and UBand glucose monitoring products, are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, and its implementing regulations, guidance documentation, and standards. Our KnowU and UBand products will be regulated by the FDA as medical devices. The FDA regulates the design, development, research, testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, distribution, sale and advertising of medical devices in the United States to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. The FDA also regulates the export of medical devices manufactured in the United States to international markets. Any violations of these laws and regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if there is a change in law, regulation or judicial interpretation, we may be required to change our business practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnder the FFDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes-Class I, Class II or Class III-depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness.\nClass I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to FDAs general controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDAs Quality System Regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below.\nClass II devices are subject to FDAs general controls, and any other special controls deemed necessary by FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as performance standards, product-specific guidance documents, special labeling requirements, patient registries or post-market surveillance. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification procedure, though certain Class II devices are exempt from this premarket review process. When a 510(k) is required, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, which in some cases may require submission of clinical data. Unless a specific exemption applies, 510(k) premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, the FDA will place the device, or the particular use of the device, into Class III, and the device sponsor must then fulfill much more rigorous premarketing requirements.\nClass III devices, consisting of devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be assured solely by general or special controls. Submission and FDA approval of a premarket approval, or PMA, application is required before marketing of a Class III device can proceed. As with 510(k) submissions, unless subject to an exemption, PMA submissions are subject to user fees. The PMA process is much more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. A PMA application, which is intended to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, must be supported by extensive data, typically including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials.\n510(k) Clearance\nTo obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, known as a predicate device. A legally marketed predicate device may include a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 for which a PMA is not required (known as a pre-amendments device based on the date of enactment of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976), a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. A device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics, or (ii) different technological characteristics, but the information provided in the 510(k) submission demonstrates that the device does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness and is at least as safe and effective as the predicate device. A showing of substantial equivalence sometimes, but not always, requires clinical data.\nBefore the FDA will accept a 510(k) submission for substantive review, the FDA will first assess whether the submission satisfies a minimum threshold of acceptability. If the FDA determines that the 510(k) submission is incomplete, the FDA will issue a Refuse to Accept letter which generally outlines the information the FDA believes is necessary to permit a substantive review and to reach a determination regarding substantial equivalence. An applicant must submit the requested information before the FDA will proceed with additional review of the submission. Once the 510(k) submission is accepted for review, by regulation, the FDA has 90 days to review and issue a determination. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence.\nIf the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the de novo process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device.\nAfter a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) marketing clearance or, depending on the modification, PMA approval. The determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the devices safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance. Many minor modifications today are accomplished by a letter to file in which the manufacture documents the rationale for the change and why a new 510(k) is not required. However, the FDA may review such letters to file to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.\nPMA Approval\nA PMA must be submitted to the FDA for any device that is classified in Class III or otherwise cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process (although the FDA has discretion to continue to allow certain pre-amendment Class III devices to use the 510(k) process). PMA applications must be supported by, among other things, valid scientific evidence demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of the device, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data. The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities, and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. Following receipt of a PMA application, once the FDA determines that the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, the FDA will formally accept the application for review. The FDA, by statute and by regulation, has 180-days to review an accepted PMA application, although the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time, and can take up to several years. During the review period, the FDA will typically request additional information or clarification of the information already provided. Also, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panels recommendation. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR.\nIf the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDAs evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post-approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.\nIn approving a PMA, the FDA may also require some form of post-market surveillance when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and makes periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients.\nNew PMAs or PMA supplements are required for modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of a PMA-approved device, including, for example, certain types of modifications to the devices indication for use, manufacturing process, labeling and design. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.\nDe Novo Classification\nMedical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II or III are automatically classified into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a new route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation, or the de novo classification procedure. This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. Under FDASIA, the FDA is required to classify the device within 120 days following receipt of the de novo application. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. In addition, the FDA may reject the reclassification petition if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed.\nIt is our current belief that our initial product is appropriate for a de novo classification request.\nBreakthrough Devices Program\nThe Breakthrough Devices Program is a voluntary program for certain medical devices and device-led combination products that provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions.\nThe goal of the Breakthrough Devices Program is to provide patients and health care providers with timely access to these medical devices by speeding up their development, assessment, and review, while preserving the statutory standards for premarket approval, 510(k) clearance, and De Novo marketing authorization, consistent with the FDAs mission to protect and promote public health.\nThe Breakthrough Devices Program replaces the Expedited Access Pathway and Priority Review for medical devices. The FDA considers devices granted designation under the Expedited Access Pathway to be part of the Breakthrough Devices Program.\nWe may pursue the Breakthrough Devices Program.\nClinical Studies\nWhen FDA clearance or approval of a Class I, Class II or Class III device requires human clinical trials, and if the device presents a significant risk to human health, the device sponsor is required to file an IDE application with the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical trial. If the device is considered a non-significant risk, IDE submission to FDA is not required. Instead, only approval from the Institutional Review Board overseeing the investigation at each clinical trial site is required. Human clinical studies are generally required in connection with approval of Class III devices and may be required for Class I and II devices. The FDA or the Institutional Review Board at each institution at which a clinical trial is being performed may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA clearance or approval to market the product in the United States.\nContinuing Regulation\nAfter a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:\n\u00b7\nproduct listing and establishment registration, which helps facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory action;\n\u00b7\nQSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;\n\u00b7\nlabeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved off-label uses;\n\u00b7\nclearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices;\n\u00b7\napproval of product modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of one of our approved devices;\n\u00b7\nmedical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers comply with FDA requirements to report if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur;\n\u00b7\npost-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments;\n\u00b7\npost-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device;\n\u00b7\nthe FDAs recall authority, whereby it can ask, or under certain conditions order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations;\n\u00b7\nregulations pertaining to voluntary recalls; and\n\u00b7\nnotices of corrections or removals.\nAdvertising and promotion of medical devices, in addition to being regulated by the FDA, are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and by state regulatory and enforcement authorities. Recently, promotional activities for FDA-regulated products of other companies have been the subject of enforcement action brought under healthcare reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. In addition, under the federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an unapproved or uncleared use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved or uncleared use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. In that event, our reputation could be damaged, and adoption of the products would be impaired.\nFurthermore, our products could be subject to voluntary recall if we or the FDA determine, for any reason, that our products pose a risk of injury or are otherwise defective. Moreover, the FDA can order a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that our product would cause serious adverse health consequences or death.\nThe FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of some of our subcontractors. Failure by us or by our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which may result in sanctions including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nuntitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions;\n\u00b7\ncustomer notifications for repair, replacement, refunds;\n\u00b7\nrecall, detention or seizure of our products;\n\u00b7\noperating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u00b7\nrefusing or delaying our requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products or modified products;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;\n\u00b7\nrefusal to grant export approval for our products; or\n\u00b7\ncriminal prosecution.\nInternational\nInternational sales are subject to regulatory requirements in the countries in which our products may be sold. The regulatory review process varies from country to country and may in some cases require the submission of clinical data. We are not currently actively pursuing approval of our product outside of the United States. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully read and consider all of the risks described below, together with all of the other information contained or referred to in this report, before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock. If any of the following events occur, our financial condition, business and results of operations (including cash flows) may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nThe near-term effects of the recent COVID-19 pandemic are known, as they adversely affected our business. Some longer term effects, such as supply chain issues and inflation, are becoming known and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flow.\nOn January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization announced a global health emergency caused by a new strain of the coronavirus, or COVID-19, and advised of the risks to the international community as the virus spread globally. In March 2020, the World Health Organization classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic based on the rapid increase in exposure globally. The spread of COVID-19 caused public health officials to recommend precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus, especially as to travel and congregating in large numbers. Over time, the incidence of COVID-19 and its variants has diminished although periodic spikes in incidence occur. Consequently, restrictions imposed by various governmental health organizations may change over time. Several states have lifted restrictions only to reimpose such restrictions as the number of cases rise and new variants arise.\nOver the past two years, the impact of COVID-19 has had adverse effects on our business by slowing down our ability to work with third parties outside of Seattle on testing and validation. We have witnessed supply chain related delays and increasing costs due to inflation. It is difficult to predict what other adverse effects, if any, COVID-19 and related matters can have on our business, or against the various aspects of same.\nWe may experience long-term disruptions to our operations resulting from changes in government policy or guidance; quarantines of employees, customers and suppliers in areas affected by the pandemic and the presence of new variants of COVID-19; and closures of businesses or manufacturing facilities critical to its business or supply chains. We are actively monitoring, and will continue to actively monitor, the pandemic and the potential impact on its operations, financial condition, liquidity, suppliers, industry and workforce.\nWe are subject to general securities market uncertainties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and geo-political and economic considerations.\nNational securities markets in the United States and worldwide have undergone unprecedented stress in recent years due to, among other things, uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, uncertainties surrounding the military conflict in Ukraine, uncertainties regarding the economy and increasing inflation, and the resulting reactions and outcomes of governments, businesses and the general population. These uncertainties have resulted in declines in all market sectors and governmental actions to support the markets. As a result, until these matters have stabilized, the markets may not be available to us for purposes of raising required capital. Should we not be able to obtain financing when required, in the amounts necessary to execute on our plans in full, or on terms which are economically feasible, we may be unable to sustain the necessary capital to pursue our strategic plan and may have to reduce the planned future growth and/or scope of our operations.\nWe need additional financing to support our technology development and ongoing operations, pay our debts and maintain ownership of our intellectual properties.\nWe are currently operating at a loss and using substantial cash to fund our operation. We believe that our cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our operations through December 31, 2023. We may need additional financing to implement our business plan and to service our ongoing operations, pay our current debts (described below) and maintain ownership of our intellectual property. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure any needed funding, or that if such funding is available, the terms or conditions would be acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain additional financing when it is needed, we will need to restructure our operations and/or divest all or a portion of our business. We are each seeking additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings and strategic collaborations. Debt financing, if obtained, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, and could increase our expenses and require that our assets secure such debt. Equity financing, if obtained, could result in dilution to our then-existing stockholders and/or require such stockholders to waive certain rights and preferences. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, or is not available at all, we may be required to delay, scale back, eliminate the development of business opportunities and our operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. There can be no assurance that we will be able to sell that number of shares, if any.\nWe need to continue as a going concern if our business is to succeed.\nWe have cash and cash equivalents of $12,593,692 and net working capital of approximately $11,040,123 (exclusive of convertible notes payable) as of September 30, 2022. We anticipate that we will record losses from operations for the foreseeable future. We believe that we have enough available cash to operate until December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2022, our accumulated deficit was $101,397,738. We intend to seek additional cash via equity and debt offerings.\nOn September 20, 2022, we completed a public offering of our common stock pursuant to which we sold 4,140,000 shares of common stock, at a purchase price of $2.00 per share, for total gross proceeds of $8,280,000. After deducting underwriting commissions and other offering expenses, we received net proceeds of $7,424,679.\nThe proceeds of warrants currently outstanding, which could be exercised on a cash basis, may generate potential proceeds of up to $15,694,288. We cannot provide assurance that any of these warrants will be exercised.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we owed approximately $2,550,484 and if we do not satisfy these obligations, the lenders may have the right to demand payment in full or exercise other remedies.\nWe owe $2,550,066 under various convertible promissory notes as of September 30, 2022 including $1,184,044 owed to entities controlled by Ronald P. Erickson, our Chairman. Mr. Erickson and/or entities with which he is affiliated also have accounts payable and accrued liabilities $295,418 of as of September 30, 2022 related to accrued compensation, accrued interest and expenses. We may need additional financing, to service and/or repay these debt obligations. If we raise additional capital through borrowing or other debt financing, we may incur substantial interest expense. If and when we raise more equity capital in the future, it will result in substantial dilution to our current stockholders.\nWe have a history of operating losses and there can be no assurance that we can achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have experienced net losses since inception. As of September 30, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $101,397,738 and net losses in the amount of $20,071,244 and $25,360,213 for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. There can be no assurance that we will achieve or maintain profitability. If we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Failure to become and remain profitable would impair our ability to sustain operations and adversely affect the price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital. Our operating expenses may increase as we spend resources on growing our business, and if our revenue does not correspondingly increase, our operating results and financial condition will suffer. Our businesses have produced minimal revenues and may not produce significant revenues in the near term, or at all, which would harm our ability to continue our operations or obtain additional financing and require us to reduce or discontinue our operations. You must consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we will encounter as business with an early-stage technology in a new and rapidly evolving industry. We may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties, which could significantly harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient revenue from the commercialization of our technology and related products to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe are in the early stages of commercializing our technology. Failure to develop and sell products based upon our technology, grant additional licenses and obtain royalties or develop other revenue streams will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To date, we have generated minimal revenue from sales of our products. We believe that our commercialization success is dependent upon our ability to significantly increase the number of customers that are using our products. In addition, demand for our products may not materialize, or increase as quickly as planned, and we may therefore be unable to increase our revenue levels as expected. We are currently not profitable. Even if we succeed in introducing our technology and related products to our target markets, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe currently rely in part upon external resources for engineering and product development services. If we are unable to secure an engineering or product development partner or establish satisfactory engineering and product development capabilities, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our technology.\nOur success depends upon our ability to develop products that are accurate and provide solutions for our customers. Achieving the desired results for our customers requires solving engineering issues in concert with them. Any failure of our technology or related products to meet customer expectations could result in customers choosing to retain their existing methods or to adopt systems other than ours.\nWe have not historically had sufficient internal resources which can work on engineering and product development matters. We have used third parties in the past and will continue to do so. These resources are not always readily available, and the absence of their availability could inhibit our research and development efforts and our responsiveness to our customers. Our inability to secure those resources could impact our ability to provide engineering and product development services and could have an impact on our customers willingness to use our technology.\nWe are in the early stages of commercialization and our technology and related products may never achieve significant commercial market acceptance.\nOur success depends on our ability to develop and market products that are recognized as accurate and cost-effective. Many of our potential customers may be reluctant to use our new technology. Market acceptance will depend on many factors, including our ability to convince potential customers that our technology and related products are an attractive alternative to existing technologies. We will need to demonstrate that our products provide accurate and cost-effective alternatives to existing technologies. Compared to most competing technologies, our technology is relatively new, and most potential customers have limited knowledge of, or experience with, our products. Prior to implementing our technology and related products, some potential customers may be required to devote significant time and effort to testing and validating our products. In addition, during the implementation phase, some customers may be required to devote significant time and effort to training their personnel on appropriate practices to ensure accurate results from our technology and products. Any failure of our technology or related products to meet customer expectations could result in customers choosing to retain their existing testing methods or to adopt systems other than ours.\nMany factors influence the perception of a system including its use by leaders in the industry. If we are unable to induce industry leaders in our target markets to implement and use our technology and related products, acceptance and adoption of our products could be slowed. In addition, if our products fail to gain significant acceptance in the marketplace and we are unable to expand our customer base, we may never generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability.\nOur subsidiaries have limited operating histories.\nParticle was incorporated April 30, 2020, and to date has engaged in activities consisting primarily of research and development on threaded light bulbs that have a warm white light that can inactivate germs, including bacteria and viruses. On May 21, 2020, we entered into an intercompany patent license agreement with Particle pursuant to which Particle received an exclusive non-transferrable license to use certain of our patents and trademarks. In exchange for this license, we will receive: (i) a one-time fee of $250,000 upon a successful financing of Particle, and (ii) a quarterly royalty payment equal to the greater of 5% of the gross sales, net of returns, from Particle and $5,000. As of September 30, 2022, the operations of Particle have not generated any sales. The first product, the Particle bulb, can be used in households, businesses, and other facilities to inactivate bacteria and viruses. Through internal preliminary testing, Particle personnel have confirmed the Particle bulbs efficacy in inactivating common germs such as E. coli and Staphylococcus. Final study results from Texas Biomedical Research Institute indicate that the Particle bulb has the ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 and, most recently, the Alpha and Delta variants of the COVID-19 virus.\nTo date, we have generated no revenue from Particle and we may not generate revenues in the near future while products are being developed. We believe that Particles commercialization success is dependent upon its ability to develop successful products to take to market. In addition, once developed, demand for its products may not materialize, or increase as quickly as planned, and we may therefore be unable to increase our revenue levels as expected. Even if Particle succeeds in introducing its technology and related products to its target markets, it may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability. The Particle team is working on certification, labeling, product manufacturing and related go-to-market requirements as well as business development activities related to interest from potential strategic and channel partners in both consumer and business applications in the global marketplace. These efforts may not be successful which would adversely impact the sustainability of Particle.\nAI Mind was incorporated on September 17, 2021. It generated its first revenues during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 from its initial commercialization efforts related to the generation of NFTs. There can be no assurance that it will continue to generate revenues nor be successful in continuing its marketing of parent company assets. These assets rely on fundamental trade secrets which at this time are proprietary yet not protected by any pending patents. It may not be possible to protect these trade secrets which would impact the ability of AI Mind to continue to generate revenues.\nWe are dependent on key personnel.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of key management and other personnel, some of whom could be difficult to replace, including Ronald P. Erickson, our Chairman, and Phil Bosua, our Chief Executive Officer. We maintain key person life insurance for Mr. Bosua. Our success will depend on the performance of our officers, our ability to retain and motivate our officers, our ability to integrate new officers into our operations, and the ability of all personnel to work together effectively as a team. Our failure to retain and recruit officers and other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our success also depends on our continued ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate highly skilled technical, managerial, manufacturing, administrative and sales and marketing personnel. Competition for these individuals is intense, and we may not be able to successfully recruit, assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. In particular, we may encounter difficulties in recruiting and retaining a sufficient number of qualified technical personnel, which could harm our ability to develop new products and adversely impact our relationships with existing and future customers. The inability to attract and retain necessary technical, managerial, manufacturing, administrative and sales and marketing personnel could harm our ability to obtain new customers and develop new products and could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe have limited insurance which may not cover claims by third parties against us or our officers and directors.\nWe have limited directors and officers liability insurance and commercial liability insurance policies. Claims by third parties against us may exceed policy amounts and we may not have amounts to cover these claims. Any significant claims would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our limited directors and officers liability insurance may affect our ability to attract and retain directors and officers.\nOur inability to effectively protect our intellectual property would adversely affect our ability to compete effectively, our revenue, our financial condition and our results of operations.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, trademark, and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights. Obtaining and maintaining a strong patent position is important to our business. Patent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is complex and uncertain, so we cannot be assured that we will be able to obtain or maintain patent rights, or that the patent rights we may obtain will be valuable, provide an effective barrier to competitors or otherwise provide competitive advantages. Others have filed, and in the future are likely to file, patent applications that are similar or identical to ours or those of our licensors. To determine the priority of inventions or demonstrate that we did not derive our invention from another, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office or in court that could result in substantial costs in legal fees and could substantially affect the scope of our patent protection. We cannot be assured our patent applications will prevail over those filed by others. Also, our intellectual property rights may be subject to other challenges by third parties. Patents we obtain could be challenged in litigation or in administrative proceedings such as ex parte reexam, inter parties review, or post grant review in the United States or opposition proceedings in Europe or other jurisdictions.\nThere can be no assurance that:\n\u00b7\nany of our existing patents will continue to be held valid, if challenged;\n\u00b7\npatents will be issued for any of our pending applications;\n\u00b7\nany claims allowed from existing or pending patents will have sufficient scope or strength to protect us;\n\u00b7\nour patents will be issued in the primary countries where our products are sold in order to protect our rights and potential commercial advantage; or\n\u00b7\nany of our products or technologies will not infringe on the patents of other companies.\nIf we are enjoined from selling our products, or if we are required to develop new technologies or pay significant monetary damages or are required to make substantial royalty payments, our business and results of operations would be harmed.\nObtaining and maintaining a patent portfolio entails significant expense and resources. Part of the expense includes periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees, various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications due in several stages over the lifetime of patents and/or applications, as well as the cost associated with complying with numerous procedural provisions during the patent application process. We may or may not choose to pursue or maintain protection for particular inventions. In addition, there are situations in which failure to make certain payments or noncompliance with certain requirements in the patent process can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If we choose to forgo patent protection or allow a patent application or patent to lapse purposefully or inadvertently, our competitive position could suffer.\nLegal actions to enforce our patent rights can be expensive and may involve the diversion of significant management time. In addition, these legal actions could be unsuccessful and could also result in the invalidation of our patents or a finding that they are unenforceable. We may or may not choose to pursue litigation or interferences against those that have infringed on our patents, or used them without authorization, due to the associated expense and time commitment of monitoring these activities. If we fail to protect or to enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our competitive position could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.\nClaims by others that our products infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights could prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products or require us to pay royalties or incur substantial costs from litigation or development of non-infringing technology.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States involving patents and other intellectual property rights. We may receive notices that claim we have infringed upon the intellectual property of others. Even if these claims are not valid, they could subject us to significant costs. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert our attention and resources, cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. We have not been engaged in litigation but litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation may also be necessary to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity by others. A successful claim of intellectual property infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed technology or develop or license technology with comparable functionality could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we are unable to secure a sales and marketing partner or establish satisfactory sales and marketing capabilities at our company, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our technology.\nIf we are not successful entering into appropriate collaboration arrangements or recruiting sales and marketing personnel or in building a sales and marketing infrastructure, we will have difficulty successfully commercializing our technology, which would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to enter into collaboration agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, even if we enter into such relationships, we may have limited or no control over the sales, marketing and distribution activities of these third parties. Our future revenues may depend heavily on the success of the efforts of these third parties. If we elect to establish a sales and marketing infrastructure, we may not realize a positive return on this investment. In addition, we must compete with established and well-funded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire, train and retain sales and marketing personnel. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize technology without strategic partners or licensees include:\n\u00b7\nour inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u00b7\nthe lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u00b7\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nWe may engage in acquisitions, mergers, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestures that could result in final results that are different than expected.\nIn the normal course of business, we engage in discussions relating to possible acquisitions, equity investments, mergers, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures. Such transactions are accompanied by a number of risks, including the use of significant amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, incurrence of debt on potentially unfavorable terms as well as impairment expenses related to goodwill and amortization expenses related to other intangible assets, the possibility that we may pay too much cash or issue too many of our shares as the purchase price for an acquisition relative to the economic benefits that we ultimately derive from such acquisition, and various potential difficulties involved in integrating acquired businesses into our operations.\nFrom time to time, we have also engaged in discussions with candidates regarding the potential acquisitions of our product lines, technologies and businesses. If a divestiture such as this does occur, we cannot be certain that our business, operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to any purchaser; identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to retain; reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business; and collect the proceeds from any divestitures.\nIf we do not realize the expected benefits of any acquisition or divestiture transaction, our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted.\nWe have made strategic acquisitions in the past and may do so in the future, and if the acquired companies do not perform as expected, this could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and existing business.\nWe may continue to expand our business through strategic acquisitions. The success of any acquisition will depend on, among other things:\n\u00b7\nthe availability of suitable candidates;\n\u00b7\nhigher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses;\n\u00b7\ncompetition from other companies for the purchase of available candidates;\n\u00b7\nour ability to value those candidates accurately and negotiate favorable terms for those acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of funds to finance acquisitions and obtaining any consents necessary under our credit facility;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to establish new informational, operational and financial systems to meet the needs of our business;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to achieve anticipated synergies, including with respect to complementary products or services; and\n\u00b7\nthe availability of management resources to oversee the integration and operation of the acquired businesses.\nWe may not be successful in effectively integrating acquired businesses and completing acquisitions in the future. We also may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources in seeking to complete acquisitions. Acquired businesses may fail to meet our performance expectations. If we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition as rapidly as expected, or at all, investors or analysts may not perceive the same benefits of the acquisition as we do. If these risks materialize, our stock price could be materially adversely affected.\nGovernment regulatory approval may be necessary before some of our products can be sold and there is no assurance such approval will be granted.\nOur technology may have a number of potential applications in fields of use which will require prior governmental regulatory approval before the technology can be introduced to the marketplace. For example, we are exploring the use of our technology for certain medical diagnostic applications, with an initial focus on the monitoring of blood glucose. There is no assurance that we will be successful in developing glucose monitoring medical applications for our technology. If we were to be successful in developing glucose monitoring medical applications of our technology, prior clearance by the FDA and other governmental regulatory bodies will be required before the technology could be introduced into the marketplace. There is no assurance that such regulatory approval would be obtained for a glucose monitoring medical diagnostic device or other applications requiring such approval. The FDA can refuse to grant, delay, and limit or deny approval of an application for clearance of marketing a glucose monitoring device for many reasons. We may not obtain the necessary regulatory approvals or clearances to market these glucose monitoring systems in the United States or outside of the United States. Any delay in, or failure to receive or maintain, approval or clearance for our products could prevent us from generating revenue from these products or achieving profitability.\nWe or our manufacturers may be unable to obtain or maintain international regulatory clearances or approvals for our current or future products, or our distributors may be unable to obtain necessary qualifications, which could harm our business.\nSales of our products internationally are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. In addition, the FDA regulates exports of medical devices from the U.S. Complying with international regulatory requirements can be an expensive and time-consuming process, and marketing approval or clearance is not certain. The time required to obtain clearances or approvals, if required by other countries, may be longer than that required for FDA clearance or approvals, and requirements for such clearances or approvals may significantly differ from FDA requirements. We may rely on third-party distributors to obtain regulatory clearances and approvals required in other countries, and these distributors may be unable to obtain or maintain such clearances or approvals. Our distributors may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and in maintaining foreign regulatory approvals or clearances, which could increase the difficulty of attracting and retaining qualified distributors. If our distributors experience delays in receiving necessary qualifications, clearances or approvals to market our products outside the U.S., or if they fail to receive those qualifications, clearances or approvals, we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets effectively, or at all.\nForeign governmental authorities that regulate the manufacture and sale of medical devices have become increasingly stringent and, to the extent we market and sell our products outside of the U.S., we may be subject to rigorous international regulation in the future. In these circumstances, we would be required to rely on our foreign independent distributors to comply with the varying regulations, and any failures on their part could result in restrictions on the sale of our product in foreign countries.\nCybersecurity risks and cyber incidents could result in the compromise of confidential data or critical data systems and give rise to potential harm to customers, remediation and other expenses, expose us to liability under consumer protection laws, or other common law theories, subject us to litigation and federal and state governmental inquiries, damage our reputation, and otherwise be disruptive to our business and operations.\nCyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. We collect and store on our networks sensitive information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers. The secure maintenance of this information and technology is critical to our business operations. We have implemented multiple layers of security measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of this data and the systems and devices that store and transmit such data. We utilize current security technologies, and our defenses are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties. Despite these efforts, threats from malicious persons and groups, new vulnerabilities and advanced new attacks against information systems create risk of cybersecurity incidents. These incidents can include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these incidents or techniques, timely discover them, or implement adequate preventative measures.\nThese threats can come from a variety of sources, ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker to malfeasance by employees, consultants or other service providers to state-sponsored attacks. Cyber threats may be generic, or they may be custom crafted against our information systems. Over the past several years, cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and much harder to detect and defend against. Our network and storage applications may be vulnerable to cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, malfeasance, loss of data privacy or other significant disruption and may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers, employees, consultants or other service providers. In addition, hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving our employees, contractors and temporary staff.\nThere can be no assurance that we will not be subject to cybersecurity incidents that bypass our security measures, impact the integrity, availability or privacy of personal health information or other data subject to privacy laws or disrupt our information systems, devices or business, including our ability to deliver services to our customers. As a result, cybersecurity, physical security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our enterprise, information systems and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities.\nWe are subject to corporate governance and internal control requirements, and our costs related to compliance with, or our failure to comply with existing and future requirements could adversely affect our business.\nWe must comply with corporate governance requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as well as additional rules and regulations currently in place and that may be subsequently adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. These laws, rules, and regulations continue to evolve and may become increasingly stringent in the future. The financial cost of compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations is expected to remain substantial.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to fully comply with these laws, rules, and regulations that address corporate governance, internal control reporting, and similar matters in the future. Failure to comply with these laws, rules and regulations could materially adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, and the value of our securities.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nWe may not be able to maintain a listing of our common stock on NYSE American.\nOur common stock is currently listed on NYSE American. We must meet certain financial and liquidity criteria to maintain the listing of our common stock on NYSE American. If we fail to meet any listing standards or if we violate any listing requirements, our common stock may be delisted. In addition, our board of directors may determine that the cost of maintaining our listing on a national securities exchange outweighs the benefits of such listing. A delisting of our common stock from NYSE American may materially impair our stockholders ability to buy and sell our common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for, our common stock. The delisting of our common stock could significantly impair our ability to raise capital and the value of your investment.\nThe price of our common stock is volatile, which may cause investment losses for our stockholders.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and is likely in the future to be volatile. Our common stock price may fluctuate in response to factors such as:\n\u00b7\nAnnouncements by us regarding liquidity, significant acquisitions, equity investments and divestitures, strategic relationships, addition or loss of significant customers and contracts, capital expenditure commitments and litigation;\n\u00b7\nIssuance of convertible or equity securities and related warrants for general or merger and acquisition purposes;\n\u00b7\nIssuance or repayment of debt, accounts payable or convertible debt for general or merger and acquisition purposes;\n\u00b7\nSale of a significant number of shares of our common stock by stockholders;\n\u00b7\nGeneral market and economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nQuarterly variations in our operating results;\n\u00b7\nInvestor and public relation activities;\n\u00b7\nAnnouncements of technological innovations;\n\u00b7\nNew product introductions by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nCompetitive activities;\n\u00b7\nLow liquidity; and\n\u00b7\nAdditions or departures of key personnel.\nThese broad market and industry factors may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe sale of a significant number of our shares of common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had 48,156,062 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. As of September 30, 2022, there were options outstanding for the purchase of 20,792,370 common shares (including unearned stock option grants totaling 9,704,620 shares related to performance targets), warrants for the purchase of 21,786,313 common shares, and 8,108,356 shares of our common stock issuable upon the conversion of Series C and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, we currently have 9,020,264 common shares at the current price of $0.25 per share reserved and are issuable upon conversion of convertible debentures of $2,255,066. All of which could potentially dilute future earnings per share but are excluded from the September 30, 2022, calculation of net loss per share because their impact is antidilutive.\nSignificant shares of common stock are held by our principal stockholders, other company insiders and other large stockholders. As affiliates, as defined under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, our principal stockholders, other of our insiders and other large stockholders may only sell their shares of common stock in the public market pursuant to an effective registration statement or in compliance with Rule 144.\nThese options, warrants, convertible notes payable and convertible preferred stock could result in further dilution to common stockholders and may affect the market price of the common stock.\nFuture capital raises or other issuances of equity or debt securities may dilute our existing stockholders ownership and/or have other adverse effects on our operations.\nPursuant to our articles of incorporation, we are authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of common stock. To the extent that common stock is available for issuance, subject to compliance with applicable stock exchange listing rules, our board of directors has the ability to issue additional shares of common stock in the future for such consideration as the board of directors may consider sufficient. The issuance of any additional shares could, among other things, result in substantial dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders at the time of issuance, result in substantial dilution of our earnings per share and adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.\nPursuant to our articles of incorporation, we are also authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock. Any preferred stock that we issue in the future may rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividend priority or liquidation premiums and may have greater voting rights than our common stock. In addition, such preferred stock may contain provisions allowing those shares to be converted into shares of common stock, which could dilute the value of our common stock to current stockholders and could adversely affect the market price, if any, of our common stock. In addition, the preferred stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of our company. Although we have no present intention to issue any shares of authorized preferred stock, there can be no assurance that we will not do so in the future.\nIn the future, we may also attempt to increase our capital resources by offering debt securities. These debt securities would have rights senior to those of our common stock and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations, including liens on our assets.\nBecause our decision to issue securities or incur debt in our future offerings will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings and debt financing. Further, market conditions could require us to accept less favorable terms for the issuance of our securities in the future. Thus, you will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the value of your shares and diluting your interest in us.\nThe exercise prices of certain warrants, and the conversion prices of our outstanding convertible notes payable and our preferred stock may require further adjustment.\nIf in the future, if we sell our common stock at a price below $0.25 per share, the conversion price of our outstanding shares of series C convertible preferred stock and series D convertible preferred stock would adjust below $0.25 per share pursuant to the documents governing such instruments. In addition, the conversion price of the convertible promissory notes referred to above and the exercise price of certain outstanding warrants to purchase 10,154,381 shares of common stock would adjust below $0.25 per share pursuant to the documents governing such instruments. Warrants totaling 4,439,707 would adjust below $1.20 per share and warrants totaling 4,465,294 would adjust below $2.40 per share, in each case pursuant to the documents governing such instruments.\nIf our company were to dissolve or wind-up operations, holders of our common stock would not receive a liquidation preference.\nIf we were to wind-up or dissolve our company and liquidate and distribute our assets, our common stockholders would share in our assets only after we satisfy any amounts we owe to our creditors and preferred equity holders. If our liquidation or dissolution were attributable to our inability to profitably operate our business, then it is likely that we would have material liabilities at the time of liquidation or dissolution. Accordingly, it is very unlikely that sufficient assets will remain available after the payment of our creditors and preferred equity holders to enable common stockholders to receive any liquidation distribution with respect to any common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nIf securities industry analysts do not publish research reports on us, or publish unfavorable reports on us, then the market price and market trading volume of our common stock could be negatively affected.\nAny trading market for our common stock may be influenced in part by any research reports that securities industry analysts publish about us. We do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by securities industry analysts. If no securities industry analysts commence coverage of us, the market price and market trading volume of our common stock could be negatively affected. In the event we are covered by analysts, and one or more of such analysts downgrade our common stock, or otherwise reports on us unfavorably, or discontinues coverage of us, the market price and market trading volume of our common stock could be negatively affected.\nIf our securities become subject to the penny stock rules, it would become more difficult to trade our common stock.\nThe SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or authorized for quotation on certain automated quotation systems, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system. If we do not retain a listing on NYSE American or another national securities exchange and if the price of our common stock is less than $5.00, our common stock could be deemed a penny stock. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document containing specified information. In addition, the penny stock rules require that before effecting any transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, a broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive (i) the purchasers written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement; (ii) a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks; and (iii) a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock, and therefore stockholders may have difficulty selling their common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions may limit the ability of another party to acquire our company, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur articles of incorporation, our bylaws and Nevada law contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring our company, even if doing so may be beneficial to our stockholders. In addition, these provisions could limit the price investors would be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.\nNot applicable. ITEM 2.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nPART II  ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.\nMarket Information\nOur common stock began trading on NYSE American under the symbol KNW on September 16, 2022.\nNumber of Holders of our Common Shares\nAs of December 20, 2022, there were approximately 186 stockholders of record of our common stock. In computing the number of holders of record of our common stock, each broker-dealer and clearing corporation holding shares on behalf of its customers is counted as a single stockholder.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the near future. We may also enter into credit agreements or other borrowing arrangements in the future that will restrict our ability to declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock. Any future determination to declare dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, general business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.

Our board of directors could, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of common stock and which could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, a majority of our outstanding voting stock.\nSeries C Convertible Preferred Stock\nRanking. With respect to dividend rights and rights on liquidation, winding up and dissolution, our series C preferred stock ranks senior to our common stock.\nVoting Rights.

Each outstanding share of series C preferred stock will accrue cumulative dividends at a rate equal to 8.0% per annum of the series C preferred stock stated value, $0.70, subject to adjustment as provided in the series C preferred stock certificate of designation.

In the event that we shall at any time pay a dividend on our common stock (other than a dividend payable solely in shares of our common stock) or any other class or series of our capital stock, we shall, at the same time, pay to each holder of series C preferred stock a dividend equal to the dividend that would have been payable to such holder if the shares of series C preferred stock held by such holder had been converted into our common stock on the date of determination of holders of our common stock entitled to receive such dividends without regard to the limitations set forth in the series C preferred stock certificate of designation.\nVoluntary Conversion Rights.

Neither the consolidation nor merger of our company into or with any other entity or entities nor the consolidation or merger of any entity or entities into our company shall be deemed to be a liquidation, but the sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all our companys assets shall be deemed a liquidation.\nDividend Rights.

In the event that we shall at any time pay a dividend on our common stock (other than a dividend payable solely in shares of our common stock) or any other class or series of our capital stock, we shall, at the same time, pay to each holder of series D preferred stock a dividend equal to the dividend that would have been payable to such holder if the shares of series D preferred stock held by such holder had been converted into our common stock on the date of determination of holders of our common stock entitled to receive such dividends without regard to the limitations set forth in the series D preferred stock certificate of designation.\nVoluntary Conversion Rights. Each holder of any shares of series D preferred stock shall have the right, at its option at any time, to convert any such shares of series D preferred stock into such number of fully paid and nonassessable whole shares of our common stock as is obtained by multiplying the number of shares of series D preferred stock to be converted by $0.70, the series D preferred stock stated value, and dividing the result by $0.25, which conversion price may be adjusted in accordance with the terms of the series D preferred stock certificate of designation, which, among other things, provides for a full ratchet anti-dilution adjustment.\nMandatory Conversion Rights. The series D preferred stock will automatically convert upon (i) the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE American market; (ii) the shares of our common stock into which the series D preferred stock would convert are eligible to be sold without restriction pursuant to Rule 144 or a registration statement registering the series D conversion shares for resale has been declared effective by the SEC and remains effective at the time of conversion; and (iii) the average Weighted Average Price (as defined in the series D certificate of designation) of our common stock is at least three (3) times the series D conversion price then in effect for 20 consecutive trading days with average daily trading volume during such period, as reported by Bloomberg, equal to or greater than $200,000.\nConversion Limitation: We shall not effect a conversion of the series D preferred stock, whether voluntary or mandatory, and the holder of any shares of series D preferred stock shall not have the right to voluntarily convert its shares of series D preferred stock, to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, such person (together with such persons affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the shares of our common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion.\nOther Rights. Holders of series D preferred stock have no preemptive or subscription rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the series D preferred stock.

Shares of series F preferred stock may only be issued to and held of record by members of our board of directors as of August 1, 2018, the date the certificate of designation for the series F preferred stock was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada.\nVoting Rights. For so long as any shares of the series F preferred stock remain issued and outstanding, the holders thereof, voting separately as a class, will not have any right to vote unless and until a Trigger Event occurs (as defined below). Upon a Trigger Event, and for so long as any shares of the series F preferred stock remain issued and outstanding, the holders thereof, voting separately as a class, shall have the right to vote on all shareholder matters at a rate equal to 100,000 shares of our common stock per share of our series F preferred stock. For example, if all 500 shares of our series F preferred stock are outstanding, the vote of the holders of our series F preferred stock will be equal to fifty million (50,000,000) shares of common stock.\nTrigger Event. At any time prior to the Explosion Date (defined below), the following events shall constitute a Trigger Event:\n(a)\na bid offer is directed to us to purchase the Company which is rejected by our board of directors;\n(b)\na tender offer to purchase our shareholders shares at cost or at a premium to the then-current market price;\n(c)\na proxy vote is called by any shareholder with a proposed vote which would result in: (i) the removal or replacement of any of our then-current directors or series F preferred stockholders, or (ii) the acquisition of another entity, the acquisition of our company or substantially all our assets by another entity, or a share exchange or merger with another entity; or\n(d)\na single shareholder or group of shareholders suspected to be working in concert acquires more than 23% of our outstanding common stock; or, any current shareholder already owning shares of our common or preferred stock with aggregate voting power in excess of 23% of the outstanding stock, acquires an additional 10% of our outstanding common stock.\nExplosion Date. The series F preferred stock will remain issued and outstanding until the date which is 731 days after the date of issuance of the series F preferred stock by our board of directors to the members of our board of directors entitled to hold the series F preferred stock, which date we refer to as the Explosion Date, unless such date is extended as the result of a Trigger Event extension (as described below). Upon the Explosion Date, the shares of series F preferred stock then outstanding will automatically be cancelled and returned to treasury without any action required by the holders thereof or our board of directors.\nTrigger Date Extension. Upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event, the Explosion Date will be extended by 183 days. If no Trigger Event has occurred, there shall be no extensions of the Explosion Date.\nTransferability. Upon a termination or resignation from our board of directors of any holder of our series F preferred stock, the shares of our series F preferred stock held by such person will automatically be transferred and assigned pro-rata to the remaining members of our board of directors then eligible to hold shares of our series F preferred stock without any consent or approval being required from the holder.\nProtective Provisions. Subject to the rights of other series of our preferred stock which may from time to time come into existence, so long as any shares of series F preferred stock are outstanding, we shall not without first obtaining the approval of the holders of at least 80% of the then outstanding shares of series F preferred stock, voting together as a class, except as otherwise provided for in the series F preferred stock certificate of designation:\n(a)\nincrease or decrease the total number of authorized shares of series F preferred stock;\n(b)\neffect an exchange, reclassification, or cancellation of all or a part of the series F preferred stock, excluding a reverse stock split or forward stock split;\n(c)\neffect an exchange, or create a right of exchange, of all or part of the shares of another class of shares into shares of series F preferred stock; or\n(d)\namend, alter or repeal any provision of our articles of incorporation or bylaws so as to adversely affect the designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights of the series F preferred stock or otherwise alter or change the rights, preferences or privileges of the shares of series F preferred stock so as to affect adversely the shares of such series, including the rights set forth in the series F preferred stock certificate of designation.\nOther Rights. Holders of series F preferred stock have no liquidation, dividend, conversion, preemptive or subscription rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the series F preferred stock. The rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of series F preferred stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of shares of any other series of preferred stock.\nEquity Incentive Plan\nAs of September 30, 2022, we have issued stock options for the purchase of 20,792,370 shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $1.618. The expiration dates of these stock options range from now to September 20, 2027. There are unearned stock option grants totaling 9,704,620 shares related to performance targets.\nWarrants to Purchase Common Stock\nAs of September 30, 2022, we have issued warrants for the purchase of 21,786,313 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $1.029. The expiration dates of these warrants range from December 2022 to September 26, 2027.\nConvertible Promissory Notes\nWe owe Clayton A. Struve $1,071,000 under convertible promissory at 10% or OID notes. We recorded accrued interest of $86,562 and $79,062 as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively. On December 7, 2022, we signed Amendments to the convertible promissory or OID notes, extending the due dates to September 30, 2023.\nOn March 16, 2018, we entered into a Note and Account Payable Conversion Agreement pursuant to which (a) all $664,233 currently owing under the J3E2A2Z Notes was converted to a Convertible Redeemable Promissory Note in the principal amount of $664,233, and (b) all $519,833 of the J3E2A2Z Account Payable was converted into a Convertible Redeemable Promissory Note in the principal amount of $519,833 together with a warrant to purchase up to 1,039,666 shares of our common stock for a period of five years. The initial exercise price of the warrants described above is $0.50 per share, also subject to certain adjustments. The warrants were valued at $110,545. Because the note is immediately convertible, the warrants and beneficial conversion were expensed as interest. We recorded accrued interest of $287,290 and $216,246 as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. On December 7, 2022, we approved Amendments to the convertible redeemable promissory notes with Ronald P. Erickson and J3E2A2Z, extending the due dates to January 30, 2023.\nSecurities Subject to Price Adjustments\nIf in the future, if we sell our common stock at a price below $0.25 per share, the conversion price of our outstanding shares of series C convertible preferred stock and series D convertible preferred stock would adjust below $0.25 per share pursuant to the documents governing such instruments. In addition, the conversion price of the convertible promissory notes referred to above and the exercise price of certain outstanding warrants to purchase 10,154,381 shares of common stock would adjust below $0.25 per share pursuant to the documents governing such instruments. Warrants totaling 4,439,707 would adjust below $1.20 per share and warrants totaling 4,465,294 would adjust below $2.40 per share, in each case pursuant to the documents governing such instruments.\nAnti-takeover Provisions\nProvisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes, our articles of incorporation and our bylaws could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third-party from acquiring us, even if the acquisition would benefit our stockholders. Such provisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes, our articles of incorporation and our bylaws are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of our board of directors and in the policies formulated by the board of directors and to discourage certain types of transactions that may involve an actual or threatened change of control of our company. These provisions are designed to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited proposal for a takeover that does not contemplate the acquisition of all of our outstanding shares, or an unsolicited proposal for the restructuring or sale of all or part of our company.\nNevada Anti-Takeover Statutes\nPursuant to our articles of incorporation, we have elected not to be governed by the terms and provisions of Nevadas control share acquisition laws (Nevada Revised Statutes 78.378 - 78.3793), which prohibit an acquirer, under certain circumstances, from voting shares of a corporations stock after crossing specific threshold ownership percentages, unless the acquirer obtains the approval of the issuing corporations stockholders. The first such threshold is the acquisition of at least one-fifth but less than one-third of the outstanding voting power.\nPursuant to our articles of incorporation, we have also elected not to be governed by the terms and provisions of Nevadas combination with interested stockholders statute (Nevada Revised Statutes 78.411 - 78.444) which prohibits an interested stockholder from entering into a combination with the corporation, unless certain conditions are met. An interested stockholder is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, beneficially owns (or within the prior two years, did beneficially own) 10 percent or more of the corporations voting stock, or otherwise has the ability to influence or control such corporations management or policies.\nBylaws\nIn addition, various provisions of our bylaws may also have an anti-takeover effect. These provisions may delay, defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt of the company that a stockholder might consider in his or her best interest, including attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders. Our bylaws may be adopted, amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of our outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote for the election of directors, and except as provided by Nevada law, our board of directors shall have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the bylaws by a vote of not less than a majority of our directors. Any bylaw provision adopted by the board of directors may be amended or repealed by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote for the election of directors. Our bylaws also contain limitations as to who may call special meetings as well as require advance notice of stockholder matters to be brought at a meeting. Additionally, our bylaws also provide that no director may be removed by less than a two-thirds vote of the issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote on the removal. Our bylaws also permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships. These provisions will prevent a stockholder from increasing the size of our board of directors and gaining control of our board of directors by filling the resulting vacancies with its own nominees.\nOur bylaws establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to the board of directors. Stockholders at an annual meeting will only be able to consider proposals or nominations specified in the notice of meeting or brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the board of directors or by a stockholder who was a stockholder of record on the record date for the meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has given us timely written notice, in proper form, of the stockholders intention to bring that business before the meeting. Although our bylaws do not give the board of directors the power to approve or disapprove stockholder nominations of candidates or proposals regarding other business to be conducted at a special or annual meeting, our bylaws may have the effect of precluding the conduct of certain business at a meeting if the proper procedures are not followed or may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect its own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.\nAuthorized but Unissued Shares\nOur authorized but unissued shares of common stock are available for our board of directors to issue without stockholder approval, subject to NYSE American rules. We may use these additional shares for a variety of corporate purposes, including raising additional capital, corporate acquisitions and employee stock plans. The existence of our authorized but unissued shares of common stock could render it more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of the company by means of a proxy context, tender offer, merger or other transaction since our board of directors can issue large amounts of capital stock as part of a defense to a take-over challenge. In addition, we have authorized in our articles of incorporation 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which 1,785,715 shares of series C convertible preferred stock and 1,016,014 shares of series D convertible preferred stock are currently designated and outstanding. Our board of directors, acting alone and without approval of our stockholders, can designate and issue one or more series of preferred stock containing super-voting provisions, enhanced economic rights, rights to elect directors, or other dilutive features, that could be utilized as part of a defense to a take-over challenge. We have designated 500 shares of series F preferred stock that contain super-majority voting rights. No shares of our designated series F preferred stock are currently outstanding.\nCumulative Voting\nNeither the holders of our common stock nor the holders of our preferred stock have cumulative voting rights in the election of our directors. The combination of the present ownership by a few stockholders of a significant portion of our issued and outstanding common stock and lack of cumulative voting makes it more difficult for other stockholders to replace our board of directors or for a third party to obtain control of our company by replacing our board of directors.\nMarket Price of and Dividends on Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters\nOur common stock trades on the NYSE American under the symbol KNW. Trades in our common stock may be subject to Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act, which imposes requirements on broker/dealers who sell securities subject to the rule to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by the rule, broker/dealers must make a special suitability determination for purchasers of the securities and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction before the sale.\nPeriod Ended\nHigh\nLow\nYear Ending September 30, 2023\nThrough December 16, 2022\n$ 2.02\n$ 1.03\nYear Ending September 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2022\n$ 3.44\n$ 1.85\nJune 30, 2022\n$ 2.71\n$ 1.36\nMarch 31, 2022\n$ 2.19\n$ 1.22\nDecember 31, 2021\n$ 2.60\n$ 1.48\nYear Ending September 30, 2021\nSeptember 30, 2021\n$ 3.95\n$ 2.06\nJune 30, 2021\n$ 4.24\n$ 1.70\nMarch 31, 2021\n$ 4.61\n$ 1.60\nDecember 31, 2020\n$ 2.95\n$ 1.10\nAs of December 16, 2022, the high and low sales price of our common stock was $1.03 per share and $1.45 per share, respectively.

This number does not include approximately 3,600 beneficial owners whose shares are held in the names of various security brokers, dealers and registered clearing agencies.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nWe have appointed American Stock Transfer & Trust Company located at 6201 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, New York 11219, telephone number is (800) 937-5449, as the transfer agent for our common stock.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. The discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in the sections titled Risk Factors and Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\nOverview\nWe are focused on the development and commercialization of proprietary biosensor technologies which, when paired with our AI deep learning platform, are capable of uniquely identifying and measuring almost any material or analyte using electromagnetic energy to detect, record, identify and measure the unique signature of said materials or analytes. We call this our Bio-RFID technology platform, when pertaining to radio and microwave spectroscopy, and our ChromaID technology platform, when pertaining to optical spectroscopy. The data obtained with our biosensor technology is analyzed with our trade secret algorithms which are driven by our AI deep learning platform.\nChromaID is the first technology developed and patented by our company. For the past several years, we have focused on extensions and new patentable inventions that are derived from and extend beyond our ChromaID technology and intellectual property. The rapid advances made with our Bio-RFID technology in our laboratory have caused us to move quickly into the commercialization phase of our company as we work to create revenue generating products for the marketplace. Today, the primary focus of our company is on our Bio-RFID technology and our commercialization and development of related patent assets. Through our wholly owned subsidiaries, we work to exploit additional opportunities and markets that our broad intellectual property and trade secret portfolio addresses.\nOn April 30, 2020, we incorporated our wholly owned subsidiary, Particle. Particle is focused on the development and commercialization of our extensive intellectual property relating to electromagnetic energy outside of the medical diagnostic arena which remains our companys singular focus. Since incorporation, Particle has engaged in research and development activities on threaded light bulbs that have a warm white light and can inactivate germs, including bacteria and viruses. Particle is now looking for partners to take this product to market.\nOn September 17, 2021 we incorporated our wholly owned subsidiary, AI Mind, for the purpose of identifying and capitalizing on market opportunities for our AI deep learning platform. The first activity undertaken by AI Mind was the creation of graphical images expressed as NFTs utilizing the AI deep learning platform. During the year ended September 30, 2022, AI Mind began generating revenue from digital asset sales of NFTs and had sales of $4,360,087.\nRecent Developments\nNYSE Listing\nOut common stock began trading on the NYSE under the symbol KNW on September 16, 2022 following the pricing (and the entering into the Underwriting Agreement) of the Offering, discussed below.\nUnderwriting Agreement\nOn September 15, 2022, we entered into an underwriting agreement (the Underwriting Agreement) with Boustead Securities, LLC, as representative (the Representative) of the underwriters named on Schedule 1 thereto (the Underwriters), relating to our public offering of common stock (the Offering). Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, we agreed to sell 3,600,000 shares of common stock to the Underwriters, at a purchase price per share of $1.86 (the offering price to the public of $2.00 per share minus the Underwriters discount), and also granted to the Underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 540,000 additional shares, solely to cover over-allotments, if any, at the public offering price less the underwriting discounts, pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-266423) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and our registration statement on Form S-1MEF (File No. 333-267448) filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) under the Securities Act (together, the Registration Statements).\nOn September 20, 2022, we completed a public offering of our common stock pursuant to which we sold 4,140,000 shares of common stock, at a purchase price of $2.00 per share, for total gross proceeds of $8,280,000. After deducting underwriting commissions and other offering expenses, we received net proceeds of $7,424,679.\nThe Underwriting Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants by the Company. It also provides that we will indemnify the Underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or contribute to payments the Underwriters may be required to make because of any of those liabilities.\nOn September 20, 2022, pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, we issued a common stock purchase warrant to Boustead Securities, LLC for the purchase of 289,800 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $2.40, subject to adjustment. The Warrant is exercisable at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part, until September 15, 2027 and may be exercised on a cashless basis. The Warrant also includes customary anti-dilution provisions and immediate piggyback registration rights with respect to the registration of the shares underlying the Warrant. The Warrant and the shares of common stock underlying the Warrant were registered as a part of the Registration Statements.\nImpact of COVID-19 Pandemic\nOn January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization announced a global health emergency caused by a new strain of the coronavirus, or COVID-19, and advised of the risks to the international community as the virus spread globally. In March 2020, the World Health Organization classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic based on the rapid increase in exposure globally. The spread of COVID-19 caused public health officials to recommend precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus, especially as to travel and congregating in large numbers. Over time, the incidence of COVID-19 and its variants has diminished although periodic spikes in incidence occur. Consequently, restrictions imposed by various governmental health organizations may change over time. Several states have lifted restrictions only to reimpose such restrictions as the number of cases rise and new variants arise.\nOver the past two years, the impact of COVID-19 has had adverse effects on our business by slowing down our ability to work with third parties outside of Seattle on testing and validation. We have witnessed supply chain related delays and increasing costs due to inflation. It is difficult to predict what other adverse effects, if any, COVID-19 and related matters can have on our business, or against the various aspects of same.\nWe may experience long-term disruptions to our operations resulting from changes in government policy or guidance; quarantines of employees, customers and suppliers in areas affected by the pandemic and the presence of new variants of COVID-19; and closures of businesses or manufacturing facilities critical to its business or supply chains. We are actively monitoring, and will continue to actively monitor, the pandemic and the potential impact on its operations, financial condition, liquidity, suppliers, industry and workforce. See also Risk Factors for more information.\nPrincipal Factors Affecting Our Financial Performance\nOur operating results are primarily affected by the following factors:\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our research and development team to produce an FDA clearance quality technology;\n\u00b7\nour ability to recruit and maintain quality personnel with the talent to bring our technology to the market;\n\u00b7\nthe production of market ready products which can sustain FDA clearance quality results;\n\u00b7\nthe clearance by the FDA after their rigorous clinical trial process of our products for the marketplace;\n\u00b7\nthe receptivity of the marketplace and the addressable diabetes community to our new non-invasive glucose monitoring technology; and\n\u00b7\naccess to sufficient capital to support us until its products achieve FDA clearance and are accepted in the marketplace.\nSegment Reporting\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standard Codification, or ASC, Topic 280, Segment Reporting, requires that an enterprise report selected information about reportable segments in its financial reports issued to its stockholders. Our management considers our business to currently consist of three operating segments (i) the development of the Bio-RFID\u2122 and ChromaID technologies; (ii) Particle, Inc. technology; and (iii) AI sales of NFT products. Particle commenced operations in the year ended September 30, 2020. AI commenced operations during the year ended September 30, 2022. For a reporting of the operating results for these three segments for the years ended September 30, 2022,\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth key components of our results of operations during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nYears Ended September 30,\n$ Variance\n% Variance\nRevenue- digital asset sales\n$ 4,360\n$ -\n$ 4,360\n100.0 %\nResearch and development and operating expenses-\nResearch and development expenses\n5,386\n3,970\n1,416\n-35.7 %\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n8,118\n6,476\n1,642\n-25.4 %\nSelling and transactional costs for digital assets\n3,430\n-\n3,430\n-100.0 %\nTotal research and development and operating expenses\n16,934\n10,446\n6,488\n-62.1 %\nOperating loss\n(12,574 )\n(10,446 )\n(2,128 )\n-20.4 %\nOther income (expense):\nInterest expense\n(8,019 )\n(14,914 )\n6,895\n46.2 %\nOther income\n-\n100.0 %\nTotal other (expense), net\n(7,497 )\n(14,914 )\n7,417\n49.7 %\nLoss before income taxes\n(20,071 )\n(25,360 )\n5,289\n20.9 %\nIncome tax expense\n-\n-\n-\n0.0 %\nNet loss\n$ (20,071 )\n$ (25,360 )\n$ 5,289\n20.9 %\nRevenues.

None of the expenditures are contractual obligations as of September 30, 2022.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as that term is defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K) that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe following discussion relates to critical accounting policies for our company. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires our management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our financial statements. These accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operation. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from managements current judgments. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements:\nRevenue Recognition. We determine revenue recognition from contracts with customers through the following steps:\n\u00b7\nidentification of the contract, or contracts, with the customer;\n\u00b7\nidentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u00b7\ndetermination of the transaction price;\n\u00b7\nallocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u00b7\nrecognition of the revenue when, or as, our company satisfies a performance obligation.\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. During the year ended September 30, 2022, our artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning platform began generating revenue from digital asset sales of NFTs. Our engineering team, using its research date, AI and proprietary algorithms, produced NFTs in the form of digital art. The NFTs produced had no recorded cost basis.\nDigital Asset Sales. Revenue includes sale of NFTs in the form of digital art generated from our artificial intelligence deep learning platform. We use the NFT exchange, OpenSea, to facilitate the transaction with the customer. Through OpenSea, we have custody and control of the NFT prior to the delivery to the customer and record revenue at the point in time when the NFT is delivered to the customer and the customer pays. We have no obligations for returns, refunds or warranty after the NFT sale. The customer pays in the form of transferring the crypto currency digital asset, Ethereum. The value of the sale is determined based on the value of the Ethereum crypto currency received as consideration. Payment is required before the NFT is delivered. Each NFT that is generated produces a unique identifying code. We also earn a royalty of up to 10%, when an NFT is resold by its owner in a secondary market transaction. We recognize this royalty as revenue when the transaction is consummated, and they receive compensation.\nAfter the sale of the NFT, the Ethereum is converted to US dollars as soon as practically possible. We record the total value of the gross NFT sale in revenue. Costs incurred in connection with the NFT transaction are recorded in the statement of operations as Selling and Transactional Cost of Digital Assets and include costs to outside consultants, estimated employee and CEO special bonus compensation, cost of converting digital assets to cash and estimated sales and use tax.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses consist of the cost of employees, consultants and contractors who design, engineer and develop new products and processes as well as materials, supplies and facilities used in producing prototypes. Our current research and development efforts are primarily focused on improving our Bio-RFID technology, extending its capacity and developing new and unique applications for this technology. As part of this effort, we conduct on-going laboratory testing to ensure that application methods are compatible with the end-user and regulatory requirements, and that they can be implemented in a cost-effective manner. We also are actively involved in identifying new applications. Our current internal team along with outside consultants has considerable experience working with the application of our technologies and their applications. We engage third party experts as required to supplement our internal team. We believe that continued development of new and enhanced technologies is essential to our future success. We incurred expenses of $5,385,586 and $3,969,972 for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, on development activities.\nEquipment. Equipment consists of machinery, leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures and software, which are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives or lease period of the relevant asset, generally 2-5 years, except for leasehold improvements which are depreciated over 5 years.\nFair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments. ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures, defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. This topic also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires classification based on observable and unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and an entitys own assumptions (unobservable inputs). The hierarchy consists of three levels:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and.\nLevel 3 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe recorded value of other financial assets and liabilities, which consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate the fair value of the respective assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 are based upon the short-term nature of the assets and liabilities.\nWe have a money market account which is considered a level 1 asset. The balance as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 was $11,821,931 and $12,217,714, respectively.\nDerivative Financial Instruments. Pursuant to ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging, we evaluate all of our financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. We then determine if embedded derivative must be bifurcated and separately accounted for. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments, we use a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within twelve months of the balance sheet date. We determined that the conversion features for purposes of bifurcation within convertible notes payable were immaterial and there was no derivative liability to be recorded as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nStock Based Compensation. We have share-based compensation plans under which employees, consultants, suppliers and directors may be granted restricted stock, as well as options and warrants to purchase shares of common stock at the fair market value at the time of grant. Stock-based compensation cost to employees is measured by us at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, over the requisite service period under ASC 718. For options issued to employees, we recognize stock compensation costs utilizing the fair value methodology over the related period of benefit.\nConvertible Securities. Based upon ASC 815-15, we have adopted a sequencing approach regarding the application of ASC 815-40 to convertible securities. We will evaluate our contracts based upon the earliest issuance date. In the event partial reclassification of contracts subject to ASC 815-40-25 is necessary, due to our inability to demonstrate we have sufficient shares authorized and unissued, shares will be allocated on the basis of issuance date, with the earliest issuance date receiving first allocation of shares. If a reclassification of an instrument were required, it would result in the instrument issued latest being reclassified first. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nNot applicable. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.\nThe full text of our audited consolidated financial statements begins on page of this annual report. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\na) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officers concluded as of September 30, 2022 that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2022, we implemented internal control procedures to address the previously identified material weaknesses by hiring a full time CFO and expanded the role of the financial reporting consultant, strengthening internal controls over financial reporting. Implementation of a full time CFO enhances the Companys internal control environment, by: (i) providing sufficient oversight of accounting personnel and activities related to our internal control over financial reporting; (ii) providing increased segregation of duties; (iii) implementing and enhancing key controls over financial reporting; and (iv) conducting technical accounting training of key financial and accounting staff members involved in preparation and review of financial reporting and interpretation of technical accounting guidance.\n(b) Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our CEO and CFO, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2022.\nPursuant to Regulation S-K Item 308(b), this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our companys registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their cost.\nc) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2022, we implemented internal control procedures to address the previously identified material weaknesses by hiring a full time CFO and expanded the role of the financial reporting consultant, strengthening internal controls over financial reporting. Implementation of a full time CFO enhances the Companys internal control environment, by: (i) providing sufficient oversight of accounting personnel and activities related to our internal control over financial reporting; (ii) providing increased segregation of duties; (iii) implementing and enhancing key controls over financial reporting; and (iv) conducting technical accounting training of key financial and accounting staff members involved in preparation and review of financial reporting and interpretation of technical accounting guidance.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2022, there were no other changes in our internal controls over financial reporting, which were identified in connection with our managements evaluation required by paragraph (d) of rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to have a material effect on our internal control over financial reporting.

Officers serve at the discretion of the board of directors.\nFamily Relationships\nThere are no family relationships among any of our officers or directors.\nInvolvement in Certain Legal Proceedings\nTo the best of our knowledge, except as described below, none of our directors or executive officers has, during the past ten years:\n\u00b7\nbeen convicted in a criminal proceeding or been subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offences);\n\u00b7\nhad any bankruptcy petition filed by or against the business or property of the person, or of any partnership, corporation or business association of which he was a general partner or executive officer, either at the time of the bankruptcy filing or within two years prior to that time;\n\u00b7\nbeen subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction or federal or state authority, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting, his involvement in any type of business, securities, futures, commodities, investment, banking, savings and loan, or insurance activities, or to be associated with persons engaged in any such activity;\n\u00b7\nbeen found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated;\n\u00b7\nbeen the subject of, or a party to, any federal or state judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated (not including any settlement of a civil proceeding among private litigants), relating to an alleged violation of any federal or state securities or commodities law or regulation, any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order, or removal or prohibition order, or any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business entity; or\n\u00b7\nbeen the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26))), any registered entity (as defined in Section 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29))), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member.\nCorporate Governance\nGovernance Structure\nWe chose to appoint a separate Chairman of the Board who is not our Chief Executive Officer. Our board of directors has made this decision based on their belief that a separate Chairman of the Board can act as a balance to the Chief Executive Officer, who also serves as a non-independent director.\nThe Boards Role in Risk Oversight\nThe board of directors oversees that the assets of our company are properly safeguarded, that the appropriate financial and other controls are maintained, and that our business is conducted wisely and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and proper governance. Included in these responsibilities is the boards oversight of the various risks facing our company. In this regard, our board seeks to understand and oversee critical business risks. Our board does not view risk in isolation. Risks are considered in virtually every business decision and as part of our business strategy. Our board recognizes that it is neither possible nor prudent to eliminate all risk. Indeed, purposeful and appropriate risk-taking is essential for our company to be competitive on a global basis and to achieve its objectives.\nWhile the board oversees risk management, company management is charged with managing risk. Management communicates routinely with the board and individual directors on the significant risks identified and how they are being managed. Directors are free to, and indeed often do, communicate directly with senior management.\nOur board administers its risk oversight function as a whole by making risk oversight a matter of collective consideration; however, much of the work is delegated to committees, which will meet regularly and report back to the full board. The audit committee oversees risks related to our financial statements, the financial reporting process, accounting and legal matters, the compensation committee evaluates the risks and rewards associated with our compensation philosophy and programs, and that the nominating and corporate governance committee evaluates risk associated with management decisions and strategic direction.\nIndependent Directors\nNYSE Americans rules generally require that a majority of an issuers board of directors must consist of independent directors. Our board of directors currently consists of five (5) directors, three (3) of whom, Messrs. Owens, Pepper and Takesako, are independent within the meaning of NYSE American rules.\nCommittees of the Board of Directors\nOur board has established an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee, each with its own charter approved by the board. Each committees charter available on our website at www.knowlabs.co. In addition, our board of directors may, from time to time, designate one or more additional committees, which shall have the duties and powers granted to it by our board of directors.\nAudit Committee\nWilliam A. Owens, Jon Pepper and Ichiro Takesako, each of whom satisfies the independence requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act and NYSE Americans rules, serve on our audit committee, with Mr. Pepper serving as the chairman. Our board has determined that Mr. Owens qualifies as an audit committee financial expert. The audit committee oversees our accounting and financial reporting processes and the audits of the financial statements of our company.\nThe audit committee is responsible for, among other things: (i) retaining and overseeing our independent accountants; (ii) assisting the board in its oversight of the integrity of our financial statements, the qualifications, independence and performance of our independent auditors and our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; (iii) reviewing and approving the plan and scope of the internal and external audit; (iv) pre-approving any audit and non-audit services provided by our independent auditors; (v) approving the fees to be paid to our independent auditors; (vi) reviewing with our chief executive officer and principal financial officer and independent auditors the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal controls; (vii) reviewing hedging transactions; and (viii) reviewing and assessing annually the audit committees performance and the adequacy of its charter.\nCompensation Committee\nWilliam A. Owens, Jon Pepper and Ichiro Takesako, each of whom satisfies the independence requirements of Rule 10C-1 under the Exchange Act and NYSE Americans rules, serve on our compensation committee, with Mr. Owens serving as the chairman. The members of the compensation committee are also non-employee directors within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act. The compensation committee assists the board in reviewing and approving the compensation structure, including all forms of compensation, relating to our directors and executive officers.\nThe compensation committee is responsible for, among other things: (i) reviewing and approving the remuneration of our executive officers; (ii) making recommendations to the board regarding the compensation of our independent directors; (iii) making recommendations to the board regarding equity-based and incentive compensation plans, policies and programs; and (iv) reviewing and assessing annually the compensation committees performance and the adequacy of its charter.\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee\nWilliam A.

The following summary briefly describes the principal features of the 2021 Plan and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2021 Plan, which is filed as an exhibit to this report.\nAwards that may be granted include: (a) incentive stock options, (b) non-qualified stock options, (c) stock appreciation rights, (d) restricted awards, (e) performance share awards, and (f) performance compensation awards. These awards offer our officers, employees, consultants and directors the possibility of future value, depending on the long-term price appreciation of our common stock and the award holders continuing service with our company. All of the permissible types of awards under the 2021 Plan are described in more detail below.\nPurposes of 2021 Plan: The purposes of the 2021 Plan are to attract and retain officers, employees and directors for our company and our subsidiaries; motivate them by means of appropriate incentives to achieve long-range goals; provide incentive compensation opportunities; and further align their interests with those of our stockholders through compensation that is based on our common stock.\nAdministration of the 2021 Plan: The 2021 Plan is administered by our compensation committee (which we refer to as the plan administrator). Among other things, the plan administrator has the authority to select persons who will receive awards, determine the types of awards and the number of shares to be covered by awards, and to establish the terms, conditions, performance criteria, restrictions and other provisions of awards. The plan administrator has authority to establish, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the 2021 Plan.\nEligible Recipients: Persons eligible to receive awards under the 2021 Plan will be those officers, employees, consultants, and directors of our company and our subsidiaries who are selected by the plan administrator.\nShares Available Under the 2021 Plan: 20,000,000 shares of our common stock were originally authorized as the maximum number of shares of our common stock that may be delivered to participants under the 2021 Plan, subject to adjustment for certain corporate changes affecting the shares, such as stock splits. This number was increased to 22,000,000 shares of common stock as of January 1, 2022 as a result of the automatic share reserve increase discussed below. Shares subject to an award under the 2021 Plan for which the award is canceled, forfeited or expires again become available for grants under the 2021 Plan. Shares subject to an award that is settled in cash will not again be made available for grants under the 2021 Plan. As of the date of this report, all shares remain available for issuance under the 2021 Plan. The 2021 Plan also authorizes for issuance the sum of (A) any shares of our common stock that, as of the date of stockholder approval of the 2021 Plan, have been reserved but not issued pursuant to any awards granted under our 2011 Stock Incentive Plan and (B) any shares of our common stock subject to stock options or similar awards granted under our 2011 Stock Incentive Plan that, after the date of stockholder approval of the 2021 Plan, expire or otherwise terminate without having been exercised in full and shares of our common stock issued pursuant to awards granted under our 2011 Stock Incentive Plan that are forfeited to or repurchased by us, with the maximum number of shares of our common stock to be added to the 2021 Plan pursuant to clause (B) equal to 13,816,370.\nAutomatic Share Reserve Increase: Subject to the provisions of Section 14 of the 2021 Plan, the number of shares available for issuance under the 2021 Plan will be increased on the first day of each calendar year beginning January 1, 2022 and ending on and including January 1, 2030 in an amount equal to the least of (i) 2,000,000 shares of our common stock, (ii) four percent (4%) of the outstanding shares of our common stock on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year or (iii) such number of shares of our common stock determined by our board of directors; provided, that such determination under clause (iii) will be made no later than the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year.\nStock Options: Stock options give the option holder the right to acquire from us a designated number of shares of common stock at a purchase price that is fixed upon the grant of the option. The exercise price will not be less than the market price of the common stock on the date of grant. Stock options granted may be either tax-qualified stock options (so-called incentive stock options) or non-qualified stock options.\nGeneral. Subject to the provisions of the 2021 Plan, the plan administrator has the authority to determine all grants of stock options. That determination will include: (i) the number of shares subject to any option; (ii) the exercise price per share; (iii) the expiration date of the option; (iv) the manner, time and date of permitted exercise; (v) other restrictions, if any, on the option or the shares underlying the option; and (vi) any other terms and conditions as the plan administrator may determine.\nOption Price. The exercise price for stock options will be determined at the time of grant. Normally, the exercise price will not be less than the fair market value on the date of grant. As a matter of tax law, the exercise price for any incentive stock option awarded may not be less than the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant. However, incentive stock option grants to any person owning more than 10% of our voting stock must have an exercise price of not less than 110% of the fair market value on the grant date.\nExercise of Options. An option may be exercised only in accordance with the terms and conditions for the option agreement as established by the plan administrator at the time of the grant. The option must be exercised by notice to us, accompanied by payment of the exercise price. Payments may be made in cash or, at the option of the plan administrator, by actual or constructive delivery of shares of common stock to the holder of the option based upon the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise.\nExpiration or Termination. Options, if not previously exercised, will expire on the expiration date established by the plan administrator at the time of grant. In the case of incentive stock options, such term cannot exceed ten years provided that in the case of holders of more than 10% of our voting stock, such term cannot exceed five years. Options will terminate before their expiration date if the holders service with our company or a subsidiary terminates before the expiration date. The option may remain exercisable for specified periods after certain terminations of employment, including terminations as a result of death, disability or retirement, with the precise period during which the option may be exercised to be established by the plan administrator and reflected in the grant evidencing the award.\nIncentive and Non-Qualified Options. As described elsewhere in this summary, an incentive stock option is an option that is intended to qualify under certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, for more favorable tax treatment than applies to non-qualified stock options. Any option that does not qualify as an incentive stock option will be a non-qualified stock option. Under the Code, certain restrictions apply to incentive stock options. For example, the exercise price for incentive stock options may not be less than the fair market value of the shares on the grant date and the term of the option may not exceed ten years. In addition, an incentive stock option may not be transferred, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and is exercisable during the holders lifetime only by the holder. In addition, no incentive stock options may be granted to a holder that is first exercisable in a single year if that option, together with all incentive stock options previously granted to the holder that also first become exercisable in that year, relate to shares having an aggregate market value in excess of $100,000, measured at the grant date.\nStock Appreciation Rights: Stock appreciation rights, or SARs, which may be granted alone or in tandem with options, have an economic value similar to that of options. When a SAR for a particular number of shares is exercised, the holder receives a payment equal to the difference between the market price of the shares on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the shares under the SAR. The exercise price for SARs normally is the market price of the shares on the date the SAR is granted. Under the 2021 Plan, holders of SARs may receive this payment - the appreciation value - either in cash or shares of common stock valued at the fair market value on the date of exercise. The form of payment will be determined by us.\nStock Awards: Restricted shares are shares of common stock awarded to participants at no cost. Restricted shares can take the form of awards of restricted stock, which represent issued and outstanding shares of our common stock subject to vesting criteria, or restricted stock units, which represent the right to receive shares of our common stock, subject to satisfaction of the vesting criteria. Those may include requirements for continuous service and/or the achievement of specified performance goals. Restricted shares are forfeitable and non-transferable until the shares vest. The vesting date or dates and other conditions for vesting are established when the shares are awarded.\nCash Awards: A cash award is an award that may be in the form of cash or shares of common stock or a combination, based on the attainment of pre-established performance goals and other conditions, restrictions and contingencies identified by the plan administrator.\nSection 162(m) of the Code: Section 162(m) of the Code limits publicly-held companies to an annual deduction for U.S. federal income tax purposes of $1.0 million for compensation paid to each of their principal executive officer or principal financial officer and their three highest compensated executive officers (other than the principal executive officer or principal financial officer) determined at the end of each year, referred to as covered employees.\nPerformance Criteria: Under the 2021 Plan, one or more performance criteria will be used by the plan administrator in establishing performance goals. Any one or more of the performance criteria may be used on an absolute or relative basis to measure the performance of our company, as the plan administrator may deem appropriate, or as compared to the performance of a group of comparable companies or published or special index that the plan administrator deems appropriate. In determining the actual size of an individual performance compensation award, the plan administrator may reduce or eliminate the amount of the award through the use of negative discretion if, in its sole judgment, such reduction or elimination is appropriate. The plan administrator shall not have the discretion to (i) grant or provide payment in respect of performance compensation awards if the performance goals have not been attained or (ii) increase a performance compensation award above the maximum amount payable under the 2021 Plan.\nOther Material Provisions: Awards will be evidenced by a written agreement, in such form as may be approved by the plan administrator. In the event of various changes to the capitalization of our company, such as stock splits, stock dividends and similar re-capitalizations, an appropriate adjustment will be made by the plan administrator to the number of shares covered by outstanding awards or to the exercise price of such awards. The plan administrator is also permitted to include in the written agreement provisions that provide for certain changes in the award in the event of a change of control of our company, including acceleration of vesting. Except as otherwise determined by the plan administrator at the date of grant, awards will not be transferable, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Prior to any award distribution, we are permitted to deduct or withhold amounts sufficient to satisfy any employee withholding tax requirements. Our board also has the authority, at any time, to discontinue the granting of awards. The board also has the authority to alter or amend the 2021 Plan or any outstanding award or may terminate the 2021 Plan as to further grants, provided that no amendment will, without the approval of our stockholders, to the extent that such approval is required by law or the rules of an applicable exchange, increase the number of shares available under the 2021 Plan, change the persons eligible for awards under the 2021 Plan, extend the time within which awards may be made, or amend the provisions of the 2021 Plan related to amendments. No amendment that would adversely affect any outstanding award made under the 2021 Plan can be made without the consent of the holder of such award. ITEM 12.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nDigital Asset Sales\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Companys artificial AI deep learning platform began generating revenue from digital asset sales of Nun-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). The Companys engineering team, using its research data, AI and proprietary algorithms, produced NFTs in the form of digital art. The Company used the NFT exchange, OpenSea, to facilitate the transaction with the customer. The Company, through OpenSea, had custody and control of the NFT prior to the delivery to the customer and recorded revenue at the point in time when the NFT was delivered to the customer and the customer paid. The customer pays in the form of transferring the crypto currency digital asset, Ethereum. The value of the sale is determined based on the value of the Ethereum crypto currency received as consideration. Payment is required before the NFT is delivered. Each NFT that is generated produces a unique identifying code. The Company also earns a royalty of up to 10% when an NFT is resold by its owner in a secondary market transaction. The Company recognizes this royalty as revenue when the transaction is consummated, and they receive compensation.\nWe identified digital asset sales as a critical audit matter due to the nature and extent of audit effort required to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to address the risks of material misstatements related to the existence and proper recognition of revenue. The nature and extent of audit effort required to address the matter includes involvement of more experienced engagement team members and discussions and consultations with internal subject matter experts related to the matter.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included consultation with internal subject matter experts regarding our planned audit responses to address risks of material misstatement, tracing NFT sales activity to a third party platform and the digital wallets, recalculating royalties earned on secondary sales, tracing Ethereum balance held in digital wallets to the online portal and we obtained evidence that management has control of the passwords or private keys required to access the third party platform and digital accounts.\n/s/ BPM LLP\nBPM LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since October 2019\nWalnut Creek, California\nDecember 20, 2022\nKNOW LABS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\nASSETS\nCURRENT ASSETS:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$ 12,593,692\n$ 12,258,218\nTotal current assets\n12,593,692\n12,258,218\nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET\n862,977\n328,504\nOTHER ASSETS\nOther assets\n13,767\n13,767\nOperating lease right of use asset\n287,930\n289,002\nTOTAL ASSETS\n$ 13,758,366\n$ 12,889,491\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCURRENT LIABILITIES:\nAccounts payable -

ORGANIZATION\nKnow Labs, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in 1998. The Company currently has authorized 205,000,000 shares of capital stock, of which 200,000,000 are shares of voting common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 5,000,000 are shares preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. At the annual shareholder meeting held on October 15, 2021, the Companys authorized shares of common stock was increased to 200,000,000 shares of voting common stock, par value $0.001 per share.\nThe Company is focused on the development and commercialization of proprietary biosensor technologies which, when paired with its artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning platform, are capable of uniquely identifying and measuring almost any material or analyte using electromagnetic energy to detect, record, identify and measure the unique signature of said materials or analytes. The Company call these its Bio-RFID technology platform when pertaining to radio and microwave spectroscopy and ChromaID technology platform when pertaining to optical spectroscopy. The data obtained with biosensor technology is analyzed with trade secret algorithms which are driven by the AI deep learning platform. There are a significant number of analytes in the human body that relate to health and wellness. The Companys focus is upon those analytes relating to human health, the identification of which provide diagnostic information and require, by their nature, clearance by the United States Food and Drug Administration.\nOn April 30, 2020, the Company incorporated Particle, Inc. (Particle) in the State of Nevada. Particle is focused on the development and commercialization of the Companys extensive intellectual property relating to electromagnetic energy outside of the medical diagnostic arena which remains the parent companys singular focus. Since incorporation, Particle has engaged in research and development activities on threaded light bulbs that have a warm white light and can inactivate germs, including bacteria and viruses. It is now looking for partners to take the product to market.\nOn September 17, 2021, the Company incorporated AI Mind, Inc. (AI Mind) in the State of Nevada. AI Mind is focused on monetizing the AI deep learning platform. Since incorporation, it initially focused on creating graphical images which were sold as Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs). During the year ended September 30, 2022, the Companys AI deep learning platform began generating revenue from digital asset sales of NFTs and had sales of $4,360,087.\n2. LIQUIDITY\nThe Company has cash and cash equivalents $12,593,692 and net working capital of $11,040,123 (exclusive of convertible notes payable) as of September 30, 2022. The Company anticipates that it will record losses from operations for the foreseeable future. The Company believes that it has enough available cash to operate until December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2022, the Companys accumulated deficit was $101,397,738. The Company has had limited capital resources and intends to seek additional cash via equity and debt offerings.\nOn September 20, 2022, the Company completed a public offering of the Companys common stock pursuant to which the Company sold 4,140,000 shares of common stock, at a purchase price of $2.00 per share, for total gross proceeds of $8,280,000. After deducting underwriting commissions and other offering expenses, we received net proceeds of $7,424,679.\nThe proceeds of warrants currently outstanding, which could be exercised on a cash basis, may generate potential proceeds of up to $15,694,288. The Company cannot provide assurance that any of these warrants will be exercised.\n3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nBasis of Presentation - The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\nPrinciples of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Particle and AI Mind. Inter-company items and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nCash and Cash Equivalents - The Company classifies highly liquid temporary investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased as cash equivalents. The Company maintains cash balances at various financial institutions. Balances at US banks are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250,000. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant risk for cash on deposit.\nKNOW LABS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nEquipment - Equipment consists of machinery, leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures and software, which are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives or lease period of the relevant asset, generally 2-5 years, except for leasehold improvements which are depreciated over 5 years.\nLong-Lived Assets - The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment annually or when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets under certain circumstances are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value. Assets to be disposed of and assets not expected to provide any future service potential to the Company are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value (less the projected cost associated with selling the asset). To the extent carrying values exceed fair values, an impairment loss is recognized in operating results.\nIntangible Assets - Intangible assets are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life, if the life is determinable. If the life is not determinable, amortization is not recorded. The Company regularly performs reviews to determine if facts and circumstances exist which indicate that the useful lives of its intangible assets are shorter than originally estimated or the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. When an indication exists that the carrying amount of intangible assets may not be recoverable, the Company assesses the recoverability of its assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Such impairment test is based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value of those assets.\nRevenue Recognition - The Company determines revenue recognition from contracts with customers through the following steps:\n\u00b7\nidentification of the contract, or contracts, with the customer;\n\u00b7\nidentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u00b7\ndetermination of the transaction price;\n\u00b7\nallocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u00b7\nrecognition of the revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. During the year ended September 30, 2022, the Companys artificial AI deep learning platform began generating revenue from digital asset sales of NFTs. The Company engineering team, using its research data, AI and proprietary algorithms, produced NFTs in the form of digital art. The NFTs produced had no recorded cost basis.\nDigital Asset Sales - Revenue includes sale of NFTs in the form of digital art generated from the Companys AI deep learning platform. The Company uses the NFT exchange, OpenSea, to facilitate the transaction with the customer. The Company, through OpenSea, has custody and control of the NFT prior to the delivery to the customer and records revenue at the point in time when the NFT is delivered to the customer and the customer pays. The Company has no obligations for returns, refunds or warranty after the NFT sale. The customer pays in the form of transferring the crypto currency digital asset, Ethereum. The value of the sale is determined based on the value of the Ethereum crypto currency received as consideration. Payment is required before the NFT is delivered. Each NFT that is generated produces a unique identifying code. The Company also earns a royalty of up to 10% when an NFT is resold by its owner in a secondary market transaction. The Company recognizes this royalty as revenue when the transaction is consummated, and they receive compensation.\nKNOW LABS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAfter the sale of the NFT, the Ethereum is converted to US dollars as soon as practically possible. The Company records the total value of the gross NFT sale in revenue. Costs incurred in connection with the NFT transaction are recorded in the statement of operations as selling and transactional cost of digital assets and include costs to outside consultants, estimated employee and CEO special bonus compensation, digital asset conversion losses and estimated sales and use tax. The amount totaled $3,430,438 for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nResearch and Development Expenses - Research and development expenses consist of the cost of employees, consultants and contractors who design, engineer and develop new products and processes as well as materials, supplies and facilities used in producing prototypes.\nThe Companys current research and development efforts are primarily focused on improving its Bio-RFID technology, extending its capacity and developing new and unique applications for this technology. As part of this effort, the Company conducts on-going laboratory testing to ensure that application methods are compatible with the end-user and regulatory requirements, and that they can be implemented in a cost-effective manner. The Company also is actively involved in identifying new applications. The Companys current internal team along with outside consultants has considerable experience working with the application of the Companys technologies and their applications. The Company engages third party experts as required to supplement the Companys internal team. The Company believes that continued development of new and enhanced technologies is essential to its future success. The Company incurred expenses of $5,385,586 and $3,969,972 for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, on development activities.\nAdvertising - Advertising costs are charged to selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred. Advertising and marketing costs for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were $610,956 and $329,375, respectively.\nFair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments - ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures, defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. This topic also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires classification based on observable and unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and an entitys own assumptions (unobservable inputs). The hierarchy consists of three levels:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and\nLevel 3 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe recorded value of other financial assets and liabilities, which consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate the fair value of the respective assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 are based upon the short-term nature of the assets and liabilities.\nThe Company has a money market account which is considered a level 1 asset. The balance as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 was $11,821,931 and $12,217,714, respectively.\nDerivative Financial Instruments - Pursuant to ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging, the Company evaluates all of its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. The Company then determines if embedded derivative must be bifurcated and separately accounted for. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments, the Company uses a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within twelve months of the balance sheet date.\nKNOW LABS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Company determined that the conversion features for purposes of bifurcation within its currently outstanding convertible notes payable were immaterial and there was no derivative liability to be recorded as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nStock Based Compensation - The Company has share-based compensation plans under which employees, consultants, suppliers and directors may be granted restricted stock, as well as options and warrants to purchase shares of Company common stock at the fair market value at the time of grant. Stock-based compensation cost to employees is measured by the Company at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, over the requisite service period under ASC 718.The Company recognizes stock compensation costs utilizing the fair value methodology over the related period of benefit.\nConvertible Securities - Based upon ASC 815-15, the Company has adopted a sequencing approach regarding the application of ASC 815-40 to convertible securities. The Company will evaluate its contracts based upon the earliest issuance date. In the event partial reclassification of contracts subject to ASC 815-40-25 is necessary, due to the Companys inability to demonstrate it has sufficient shares authorized and unissued, shares will be allocated on the basis of issuance date, with the earliest issuance date receiving first allocation of shares. If a reclassification of an instrument were required, it would result in the instrument issued latest being reclassified first.\nNet Loss per Share - Under the provisions of ASC 260, Earnings Per Share, basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted net loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company had 48,156,062 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. As of September 30, 2022, there were options outstanding for the purchase of 20,792,370 common shares (including unearned stock option grants totaling 9,704,620 shares related to performance targets), warrants for the purchase of 21,786,313 common shares, and 8,108,356 shares of our common stock issuable upon the conversion of Series C and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, the Company currently has 9,020,264 common shares at the current price of $0.25 per share reserved and are issuable upon conversion of convertible debentures of $2,255,066. All of the foregoing shares could potentially dilute future earnings per share but are excluded from the September 30, 2022, calculation of net loss per share because their impact is antidilutive.\nAs of September 30, 2021, the Company had 35,166,551 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. As of September 30, 2021, there were options outstanding for the purchase of 15,315,120 common shares (including unearned stock option grants totaling 11,775,745 shares related to performance targets), warrants for the purchase of 22,564,255 common shares, and 8,108,356 shares of the Companys common stock issuable upon the conversion of Series C and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, the Company currently has 16,124,764 common shares (9,020,264 common shares at the current price of $0.25 per share and 7,104,500 common shares at the current price of $2.00 per share) reserved and are issuable upon conversion of convertible debentures of $16,464,066. All of the foregoing shares could potentially dilute future earnings per share but are excluded from the September 30, 2021, calculation of net loss per share because their impact is antidilutive.\nComprehensive loss - Comprehensive loss is defined as the change in equity of a business during a period from non-owner sources. There were no differences between net loss for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 and comprehensive loss for those periods.\nDividend Policy - The Company has never paid any cash dividends and intends, for the foreseeable future, to retain any future earnings for the development of its business. The Companys future dividend policy will be determined by the board of directors on the basis of various factors, including results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements and investment opportunities.\nUse of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nKNOW LABS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions related to intraperiod tax allocations, foreign subsidiaries, and interim reporting that are present within existing GAAP rules. The ASU also provides updated guidance regarding the tax treatment of certain franchise taxes, goodwill and nontaxable entities, among other items. In addition, ASU 2019-12 clarifies that the effect of a change in tax laws or rates should be reflected in the annual effective tax rate computation during the interim period that includes the enactment date. We adopted ASU 2019-12 as of October 3, 2021, (as of the beginning of fiscal 2022) and its adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.\nBased on the Companys review of accounting standard updates issued since the filing of the September 30, 2022 Form 10-K, there have been no other newly issued or newly applicable accounting pronouncements that have had, or are expected to have, a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.\nOther accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\n4. AI DEEP LEARNING PLATFORM\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, the Companys AI deep learning platform began generating revenue from digital asset sales of NFTs and had sales of $4,360,087. The Companys sales of NFTs are generated using the NFT digital exchange, OpenSea. Customers purchasing the NFTs must make payments in the crypto currency, Ethereum. The Ethereum is received into a digital wallet and then moved to an account at Coinbase where the Ethereum is converted to U.S. dollars. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company was not able to establish a digital wallet and corporate account at Coinbase in order to receive the Ethereum. The Company used the digital wallet and Coinbase account of the Companys CEO.

Because it is not more likely than not that sufficient tax earnings will be generated to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards, a corresponding valuation allowance equal to 100% of the gross deferred tax asset of approximately $11.4 million and $9.7 million was established as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company does not recognize the majority of state tax loss operating loss carryforwards as a deferred tax asset given it no longer has any operation in those states.\nUnder the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the amounts of, and benefits from, net operating losses may be limited in certain circumstances, including a change in control. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in its stock ownership. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to utilize any net operating loss carryforwards in the future. The Company is subject to possible tax examination for the years 2017 through 2022.\nThe principal components of the Companys deferred tax assets at September 30, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\nNet operating loss carryforward\n$ 9,372,000\n$ 8,051,000\nStock based compensation\n1,677,000\n975,000\nIntangibles\n221,000\n276,000\nAccruals and reserves\n97,000\n399,000\nTotal deferred tax asset\n11,367,000\n9,701,000\nValuation allowance\n(11,367,000 )\n(9,701,000 )\nNet deferred tax assets\n$ -\n$ -\nChange in valuation allowance during the year\n$ (1,666,000 )\n$ (1,092,357 )\nA reconciliation of the United States Federal Statutory rate to the Companys effective tax rate for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 are as follows. For the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Companys effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate principally due to nondeductible expenses paid with equity instruments plus an increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance.\nIncome tax provision at statutory rate\n-21 %\n-21 %\nNon deductible expenses paid with equity instruments\n9 %\n12 %\nChange in valuation allowance\n8 %\n7 %\nOther and prior year true up\n4 %\n2 %\nEffective tax rate\n0 %\n0 %\nAs of September 30, 2022, there were no uncertain tax positions.
