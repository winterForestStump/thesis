Centers of excellence bring expertise together in one location, providing an efficient support structure for end-to-end manufacturing, with quicker cycle times, in partnership with teams such as research and development (R&D), product engineering, human resources, procurement, and supply chain. For our locations in Singapore and Taiwan, this is also a combination of bringing fabrication and back-end manufacturing together. We make significant investments to develop proprietary product and process technology, which generally increases bit density per wafer and reduces per-bit manufacturing costs of each generation of product. We continue to introduce new generations of products that offer improved performance characteristics, including higher data transfer rates, advanced packaging solutions, lower power consumption, improved read/write reliability, and increased memory density.\nWe face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets and to remain competitive we must continuously develop and implement new products and technologies and decrease manufacturing costs in spite of ongoing inflationary cost pressures. Our success is largely dependent on obtaining returns on our R&D investments, efficient utilization of our manufacturing infrastructure, development and integration of advanced product and process technologies, market acceptance of our diversified portfolio of semiconductor-based memory and storage solutions, and efficient capital spending.\nSales, Markets, and Products\nProduct Technologies\nOur product portfolio of memory and storage solutions, advanced solutions, and storage platforms is based on our high-performance semiconductor memory and storage technologies, including DRAM, NAND, and NOR. We sell our products into various markets through our business units in numerous forms, including components, modules, SSDs, managed NAND, MCPs, and wafers. Our system-level solutions, including SSDs and managed NAND, combine NAND, a controller, firmware, and in some cases DRAM.\nDRAM: DRAM products are dynamic random access memory semiconductor devices with low latency that provide high-speed data retrieval with a variety of performance characteristics. DRAM products lose content when power is turned off (volatile) and are most commonly used in client, cloud server, enterprise, networking, graphics, industrial, and automotive markets. LPDRAM products, which are engineered to meet standards for performance and power consumption, are sold into smartphone and other mobile-device markets (including client markets for Chromebooks and notebook PCs), as well as into the automotive, industrial, and consumer markets.\n7 | 2023 10-K\nNAND: NAND products are non-volatile, re-writeable semiconductor storage devices that provide high-capacity, low-cost storage with a variety of performance characteristics. NAND is used in SSDs for the enterprise and cloud, client, and consumer markets and in removable storage markets. Managed NAND is used in smartphones and other mobile devices, and in consumer, automotive, and embedded markets. Low-density NAND is ideal for applications like automotive, surveillance, machine-to-machine, automation, printer, and home networking.\nNOR: NOR products are non-volatile re-writable semiconductor memory devices that provide fast read speeds. NOR is most commonly used for reliable code storage (e.g., boot, application, operating system, and execute-in-place code in an embedded system) and for frequently changing small data storage and is ideal for automotive, industrial, and consumer applications.\nProducts by Business Unit and Market\nCompute and Networking Business Unit (CNBU)\nCNBU includes memory products and solutions sold into client, cloud server, enterprise, graphics, and networking markets. CNBU reported revenue of $5.71 billion in 2023, $13.69 billion in 2022, and $12.28 billion in 2021.

By engaging with our customers early in the product life-cycle to identify and design features and performance characteristics into our products, we are able to manufacture products that anticipate and address our customers changing needs. Collaborating with our customers on their design needs in changing end markets and meeting their timelines for qualifying new products allows us to differentiate our memory and storage solutions, which provides greater value to our customers.\nOur semiconductor memory and storage products are offered under our Micron and Crucial brand names and through private labels. We market our semiconductor memory and storage products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices to support our worldwide customer base. Our products are also offered through distributors, retailers, and independent sales representatives. Our distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products, including our competitors products. Our independent sales representatives obtain orders, subject to final acceptance by us, and we then make shipments against these orders directly to customers or through our distributors. We sell our Crucial-branded products through a web-based customer-direct sales channel as well as through channel and distribution partners. We maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products.\nDue to volatile industry conditions, our customers are generally reluctant to enter into long-term, fixed-price purchase contracts. We typically enter into long-term agreements with our customers with acknowledgment that pricing, quantity, and other terms will be periodically negotiated to reflect market conditions and our customers demand for our products.\nIn each of the last three years, approximately one-half of our total revenue was from our top ten customers. For other information regarding our concentrations and customers, see Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Certain Concentrations.\nCompetitive Conditions\nWe face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies, including Kioxia Holdings Corporation; Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.; SK hynix Inc.; and Western Digital Corporation. Our competitors may use aggressive pricing to obtain market share. Some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have a larger market share and greater resources to invest in technology, capitalize on growth opportunities, and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete. Consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage as our competitors may benefit from increased manufacturing scale and a stronger product portfolio. We operate in different jurisdictions than our competitors and may be impacted by unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.\nIn addition, some governments may provide, or have provided and may continue to provide, significant assistance, financial or otherwise, to some of our competitors or to new entrants and may intervene in support of national industries and/or competitors. In particular, we face the threat of increasing competition as a result of significant investment in the semiconductor industry by the Chinese government and various state-owned or affiliated entities, in companies such as Yangtze Memory Technologies Co., Ltd. (YMTC) and ChangXin Memory Technologies, Inc. (CXMT). In addition, the May 21, 2023 decision by Chinas Cyberspace Administration (the CAC) that critical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products had an impact on our ability to compete effectively in China and elsewhere.\nWe and our competitors generally seek to increase wafer output, improve yields, and reduce die size, which could result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices. During periods of supply overcapacity, the industry may experience a temporary interruption in increased wafer output due to curtailed capital expenditures. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage also result from fabrication capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization, or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory and storage production. Our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. We, and some of our competitors, have plans to ramp, or are constructing or ramping, production at new fabrication facilities. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage, if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand, could lead to declines in average selling prices for our products and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. If competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology, their products could have cost or performance advantages.\nManufacturing\nWe manufacture our products within our own facilities located in Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, the United States, Malaysia, and China, and also utilize subcontractors to perform certain manufacturing processes. Our products are manufactured on 300mm wafers in facilities that generally operate 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Semiconductor manufacturing is capital intensive, requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment. Our DRAM, NAND, and NOR products share a number of common manufacturing processes, enabling us to leverage our product and process technology and certain resources and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines.\n11 | 2023 10-K\nOur process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex and involves numerous precise steps, including wafer fabrication, post fabrication processing, assembly, and test. Efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effectively deploying those techniques across multiple facilities. The primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process line-width, 3D non-volatile layers, NAND cell levels, process complexity (including the number of mask layers and fabrication steps), and manufacturing yield. Other factors include the cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment, equipment utilization, cost of raw materials, labor productivity, package type, cleanliness of our manufacturing environment, and utilization of subcontractors to perform certain manufacturing processes. As we continue to increase our production of high value products and solutions, manufacturing costs are increasingly affected by the costs of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) controllers and other semiconductors, advanced and complex packaging configurations, and testing at progressively higher performance speeds and quality levels. We continuously enhance our production processes, increase bits per wafer, transition to higher density products, and utilize advanced testing and assembly processes.\nWafer fabrication occurs in a highly-controlled clean environment to minimize yield loss from contaminants. Despite stringent manufacturing controls, individual circuits may be nonfunctional or wafers may be scrapped due to equipment errors, minute impurities in materials, defects in photomasks, circuit design marginalities or defects, or contamination from airborne particles, among other factors. Success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects and improving process margin to maximize yield of high-quality circuits. In this regard, we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing, screening, and testing processes. We continue to heighten quality control as our product offerings expand into higher-end segments that require increasing performance targets.\nOur products are manufactured and sold in both packaged form and as unpackaged bare die. Our packaged products include packaged die, memory modules, and system-level solutions, such as SSDs, managed NAND, and MCPs. We assemble many products in-house and, in some cases, outsource assembly services for certain packaged die, memory modules, SSDs, and MCPs. We test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process, conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow, and perform high temperature burn-in on finished products. In addition, we use our proprietary AMBYX\u2122 line of intelligent test and burn-in systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor die, capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost.\nIn recent years, we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products and system solutions, which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing and supply chain operations. Although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes, our costs can be affected by frequent conversions to new products; the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex, smaller-volume products; and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines.\nResources\nSupply Chain, Materials, and Third-Party Service Providers\nOur supply chain and operations are dependent on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and the use of third parties to provide us with components and services. We generally have multiple sources of supply for our materials and services. However, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain materials, components, and services that meet our standards and, in some cases, materials, components, or services are provided by a single or sole source, and we may be unable to qualify new suppliers on a timely basis. The availability of materials or components such as chemicals, silicon wafers, gases, photoresist, controllers, substrates, lead frames, printed circuit boards, targets, and reticle glass blanks is impacted by various factors. These factors could include a shortage of raw materials or a disruption in the processing or purification of those raw materials into finished goods. Shortages or increases in lead times have occurred in the past, are currently occurring with respect to some materials and components, and may occur from time to time in the future. Constraints within our supply chain for certain materials and integrated circuit components could limit our bit shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with third-party manufacturers of controllers, analog integrated circuits, and other components used in some of our products and with outsourced semiconductor foundries, assembly and test providers, contract manufacturers, logistics carriers, and other service providers, including providers of electricity and other utilities. Although we have certain long-term contracts with some of our suppliers, many of these contracts do not provide for long-term capacity or pricing commitments. To the extent we do not have firm commitments from our third-party suppliers over a specific time period or for any specific capacity, quantity, and/or pricing, our suppliers may allocate capacity to their other customers and capacity and/or materials may not be available when needed or at reasonable prices. Inflationary pressures have increased, and may continue to increase costs for materials, supplies, and services. Regardless of contract structure, large swings in demand may exceed our contracted supply and/or our suppliers capacity to meet those demand changes resulting in a shortage of parts, materials, or capacity needed to manufacture our products. In addition, if any of our suppliers was to cease operations or become insolvent, this could impact their ability to provide us with necessary supplies, and we may not be able to obtain the needed supply in a timely way or at all from other providers.\nCertain materials are primarily available in a limited number of countries, including rare earth elements, minerals, and metals. Trade disputes, geopolitical tensions, economic circumstances, political conditions, or public health issues may limit our ability to obtain such materials. Although these rare earth and other materials are generally available from multiple suppliers, China is the predominant producer of certain of these materials. If China were to restrict or stop exporting these materials, our suppliers ability to obtain such supply may be constrained and we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities, or obtain supply in a timely manner, or at a commercially reasonable cost. Constrained supply of rare earth elements, minerals, and metals may restrict our ability to manufacture certain of our products and make it difficult or impossible to compete with other semiconductor memory and storage manufacturers who are able to obtain sufficient quantities of these materials from China.\nWe and/or our suppliers and service providers could be affected by regional conflicts, civil unrest, labor disruptions, sanctions, tariffs, embargoes, or other trade restrictions, as well as laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change, conflict minerals, responsible sourcing practices, public health crises, or other matters, which could limit the supply of our materials and/or increase the cost. Environmental regulations could limit our ability to procure or use certain chemicals or materials in our operations or products. In addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of materials. Our ability to procure components to repair equipment essential for our manufacturing processes could also be negatively impacted by various restrictions or disruptions in supply chains, among other items. The disruption of our supply of materials, components, or services, or the extension of our lead times could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur inability to source materials, supplies, capital equipment, or third-party services could affect our overall production output and our ability to fulfill customer demand. Significant or prolonged shortages of our products could halt customer manufacturing and damage our relationships with these customers. Any damage to our customer relationships as a result of a shortage of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nSimilarly, if our customers experience disruptions to their supplies, materials, components, or services, or the extension of their lead times, they may reduce, cancel, or alter the timing of their purchases with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nPatents and Licenses\nAs of August 31, 2023, we owned approximately 13,100 active U.S. patents and 6,300 active foreign patents. In addition, we have thousands of U.S. and foreign patent applications pending. Our patents have various terms expiring through 2042.\nFrom time to time, we sell and/or license our technology to other parties and continue to pursue opportunities to monetize our investments in our intellectual property through partnering and other arrangements. We have also jointly developed memory and storage product and process technology with third parties on a limited basis.\n13 | 2023 10-K\nWe have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements and have, from time to time, licensed or sold our intellectual property to third parties. Some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments while others have resulted in us receiving payments. We may need to obtain additional licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future, and we may enter into additional sales or licenses of intellectual property and partnering arrangements. We are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to us.\nResearch and Development\nOur R&D efforts are focused primarily on development of memory and storage solutions, including our industry-leading DRAM and NAND technology, that enable continuous improvement in performance and cost structure for our products. In DRAM, our 1\u00df node was introduced ahead of the industry and we ramped our manufacturing of it during 2023. We plan to implement EUV lithography on the DRAM node after 1\u00df. In NAND, the introduction of our 232-layer node was also ahead of the industry and we ramped our manufacturing of it during 2023. We are also focused on developing new fundamentally different memory structures, materials, and packages designed to facilitate our transition to next generation products. Additional R&D efforts are concentrated on the enablement of advanced computing, storage, and mobile memory architectures and the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise. Product design and development efforts include high-density DDR5, LPDDR5, HBM, CXL based products, and advanced graphics DRAM; 3D NAND (including TLC and QLC technologies); mobile and storage solutions (including firmware and controllers); managed NAND; SSDs; and other memory technologies and systems.\nTo compete in the semiconductor memory and storage markets, we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes. The continued evolution of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected customer requirements for memory and storage products and solutions. Our process, design, firmware, controller, package, and system development efforts occur at multiple locations across the world. Our primary R&D centers are located in Boise, Idaho; India; Japan; Taiwan; China; Italy; Singapore; Germany; Malaysia; and other sites in the United States.\nR&D expenses vary primarily with the number of development and pre-qualification wafers processed and end-product solutions developed, personnel costs, and the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, such as investments in EUV lithography equipment. Because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products, we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing. Development of a product is deemed complete when it is qualified through internal reviews and tests for performance, functionality, and reliability. R&D expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification.\nHuman Capital\nWe depend on a highly educated and experienced workforce to design, develop, and manufacture high-quality, cutting-edge memory and storage solutions. As of August 31, 2023, we had approximately 43,000 employees located in the following regions:\nRegion Percent All Percent Women\nAsia 78 % 34 %\nAmericas\n20 % 20 %\nEurope, Middle East, and Africa\n2 % 21 %\nTotal 100 % 31 %\nAs of August 31, 2023 and September 1, 2022, 31% of our global workforce were women. As of August 31, 2023, 25% of our technical or engineering roles were held by women, as compared to 24% as of September 1, 2022. Women comprised 17% of our senior leaders as of August 31, 2023 and September 1, 2022.\nOur Board of Directors was comprised of four men and four women as of August 31, 2023. In addition, as of August 31, 2023, based on self-identification, one member of our Board of Directors is Asian, one member is African-American, and six members are White. One member of our Board of Directors is a veteran of the U.S. military.\nTalent Acquisition, Development, and Engagement\nFinding and retaining the best and brightest people in an extremely competitive industry environment is a strategic imperative for our business. We partner with our communities, institutions, governments, and associations to expand the pipeline of diverse, highly skilled STEM talent globally. Our partnerships with K-12 and post-secondary education systems are key to training and inspiring the next generation to consider STEM careers in the semiconductor industry. We use AI to reduce or eliminate the potential for bias from resumes, allowing us to focus on individual merit over personal characteristics. We are committed to developing team members at all stages of their careers, including on-the-job training, continuing education, a robust mentoring program, and numerous internal certifications and training. In addition, we develop and accelerate our leaders careers through targeted learning that helps them move to higher-level positions or across functions.\nWe use a research-based, people-centric approach to understanding and improving team member engagement. Periodically, we invite all team members to participate in our internal engagement survey, which covers questions that measure and provide insight into three driving factors: meaningfulness, availability, and psychological safety. In April 2023, 82% of our team members participated in the survey. The results of the survey are shared with all team members and management uses feedback from the survey to identify and implement continuous improvements to our culture and workplace practices.\nCompensation and Benefits\nOur compensation programs are designed to support our team members financial and personal wellbeing by providing a valuable return for their contributions to the company. Our total compensation strategy includes base salary, annual bonuses, equity awards, a discounted stock purchase plan, and a comprehensive benefits package.\nDiversity, Equality, and Inclusion\nWe have five diversity, equality, and inclusion (DEI) commitments that serve as the roadmap of our DEI work internally, within our industry, and in the community at large. To hold ourselves accountable, each commitment is assigned an executive sponsor who is responsible for its strategy and execution. Our five DEI commitments are summarized as follows:\nIncrease representation of underrepresented groups\nDrive equitable pay and inclusive benefits\nChampion advocacy and strengthen our culture of inclusion\nEngage with diverse financial institutions for cash management\nIncrease diverse supplier representation and spending\nWe have a regular review of pay globally, including base pay and stock awards, to drive compensation equitably. In 2023, due to challenging industry conditions, base pay increases were suspended, however we achieved global pay equity for all underrepresented employees in compensation across bonuses and stock rewards. In 2022 and 2021, we achieved comprehensive global pay equity for all employees in total compensation across base pay, bonuses, and stock rewards. A pay equity analysis will be conducted in 2024 with our base pay merit review. We also continually assess our global leave, medical, and financial benefits to ensure inclusiveness. In addition, a portion of our company-wide annual bonus program is based on the achievement of DEI-related goals.\n15 | 2023 10-K\nHealth, Safety, and Wellbeing\nProactive efforts to prevent occupational illnesses and injuries allow us to maintain a safe, healthy, and secure workplace. Each of our sites have health and safety committees, which are designed to promote overall operations and communications regarding safety and to help lead and implement secure and compliant work areas. Our safety program creates a unified corporate safety culture by establishing a formal training structure and common safety practices across our global facilities.\nIn addition to our proactive efforts on safety, our team member wellness program offers resources across our five pillars of wellbeing (physical, mental, social, career, and financial). We provide services to our team members including free mental health and counseling support, on-site and near-site fitness centers, wellness spaces and health clinics at certain Micron sites, money management and other financial education tools, and encouraging team members to form healthy habits, reduce stress and reinforce mindfulness solutions by participating in wellbeing challenges and measuring their personal progress. We also provide exclusive access to near-site, company-sponsored childcare centers, financial subsidies to help families with cost, and partnerships with community centers.\nWe are a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), a group of leading companies focused on promoting responsible working conditions, ethical business practices, and environmental stewardship throughout our global supply chain. We strive to adhere to both our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (available on our website, www.micron.com) and the RBA code of conduct, which is a demonstration of our commitment to integrity and responsible practices.\nAdditional information about our human capital is included in our 2023 Sustainability Report and our 2022 DEI Annual Report, each available on our website. Information contained or referenced on our website is not incorporated by reference and does not form a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGovernment Regulations\nOur worldwide business activities are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and our products are governed by a number of rules and regulations and customer expectations. The efforts and expenditures needed to comply with these laws, rules, and regulations do not presently have a material impact on our results of operations, capital expenditures, or competitive position. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future government laws, including, but not limited to, our operations, products, global trade, business acquisitions, employee health and safety, and taxes could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations, capital expenditures, or competitive position. See ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, this section discusses important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us. The order of presentation is not necessarily indicative of the level of risk that each factor poses to us. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price. Our operations could also be affected by other factors that are presently unknown to us or not considered significant.\nRisk Factor Summary\nRisks Related to Our Business, Operations, and Industry\nvolatility in average selling prices of our products;\na range of factors that may adversely affect our gross margins;\nour international operations, including geopolitical risks;\nthe highly competitive nature of our industry;\nour ability to develop and produce new and competitive memory and storage technologies and products;\nrealizing expected returns from capacity expansions;\nachieving or maintaining certain performance or other obligations associated with incentives from various governments;\navailability and quality of materials, supplies, and capital equipment and dependency on third-party service providers;\na downturn in regional or worldwide economies;\ndisruptions to our manufacturing process from operational issues, natural disasters, or other events;\ndependency on a select number of key customers, including international customers;\nproducts that fail to meet specifications, are defective, or are incompatible with end uses;\nbreaches of our security systems or products, or those of our customers, suppliers, or business partners;\nattracting, retaining, and motivating highly skilled employees;\nresponsible sourcing requirements and related regulations;\nenvironmental, social, and governance considerations;\nacquisitions and/or alliances; and\nrestructure plans may not realize expected savings or other benefits.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property and Litigation\nprotecting our intellectual property and retaining key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property;\nlegal proceedings and claims; and\nclaims that our products or manufacturing processes infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others or failure to obtain or renew license agreements covering such intellectual property.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nimpacts of government actions and compliance with tariffs, trade restrictions, and/or trade regulations;\ntax expense and tax laws in key jurisdictions; and\ncompliance with laws, regulations, or industry standards, including environmental considerations.\nRisks Related to Capitalization and Financial Markets\nour ability to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing;\nour debt obligations;\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\ncounterparty default risk;\nvolatility in the trading price of our common stock; and\nfluctuations in the amount and frequency of our common stock repurchases and payment of cash dividends and resulting impacts.\n21 | 2023 10-K\nRisks Related to Our Business, Operations, and Industry\nVolatility in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory and storage products may adversely affect our business.\nWe have experienced significant volatility in our average selling prices and may continue to experience such volatility in the future. For example, average selling prices for DRAM declined in the high-40s percent range and NAND declined in the low-50s percent range for 2023 as compared to 2022. Since 2017, annual percentage changes in DRAM average selling prices have ranged from approximately plus 35% to a minus high-40s percent range. Since 2017, annual percentage changes in NAND average selling prices have ranged from nearly flat to a minus low-50s percent range. In current and recent periods, average selling prices for our products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in the future. Average selling prices for our products that decline faster than our costs have recently had an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and in future periods could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur gross margins may be adversely affected by a range of factors.\nOur gross margins are dependent, in part, upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes and product designs. Factors that may limit our ability to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to prevent deterioration of or improve gross margins include, but are not limited to:\nstrategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix;\nincreasing complexity of manufacturing processes;\ndifficulties in transitioning to smaller line-width process technologies or additional 3D memory layers or NAND cell levels;\nprocess complexity including number of mask layers and fabrication steps;\nmanufacturing yield;\ntechnological barriers;\nchanges in process technologies;\nnew products that may require relatively larger die sizes;\nstart-up or other costs associated with capacity expansions;\nhigher costs of goods and services due to inflationary pressures or market conditions; and\nhigher manufacturing costs per gigabit due to fabrication facility underutilization, lower wafer output, and insufficient volume to run new technology nodes to achieve cost optimization.\nMany factors may result in a reduction of our output or a delay in ramping production, which could lead to underutilization of our production assets. These factors may include, among others, a weak demand environment, industry oversupply, inventory surpluses, difficulties in ramping emerging technologies, supply chain disruptions, and delays from equipment suppliers. See Part II - Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview - Industry Conditions for information regarding our current underutilization. A significant portion of our manufacturing costs are fixed and do not vary proportionally with changes in production output. As a result, lower utilization, lower wafer output, and corresponding increases in our per gigabit manufacturing costs have resulted in higher inventory carrying costs, and have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our gross margins, business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe have a broad portfolio of products to address our customers needs, which span multiple market segments and are subject to rapid technological changes. Our manufacturing costs on a per gigabit basis vary across our portfolio as they are largely influenced by the technology node in which the solution was developed. We strive to balance our demand and supply for each technology node, but the dynamics of our markets and our customers can create periods of imbalance, which can lead us to carry elevated inventory levels. Consequently, we may incur charges in connection with obsolete or excess inventories, or we may not fully recover our costs, which would reduce our gross margins. For example, in 2023, we recorded aggregate charges of $1.83 billion to write down the carrying value of our inventories to their estimated net realizable value. In addition, due to the customized nature of certain products we manufacture, we may be unable to sell certain finished goods inventories to alternative customers or manufacture in-process inventory to different specifications, which may result in excess and obsolescence charges in future periods.\nIn addition, if we are unable to supply products that meet customer design and performance specifications, we may be required to sell such products at lower average selling prices, which may reduce our gross margins. Our gross margins may also be impacted by shifts in product mix, driven by our strategy to optimize our portfolio to best respond to changing market dynamics.\nOur inability to prevent deterioration of or improve gross margins could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe face geopolitical and other risks associated with our international operations that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nIn addition to our U.S. operations, a substantial portion of our operations are conducted in Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, Malaysia, China, and India, and many of our customers, suppliers, and vendors also operate internationally. In 2023, nearly half of our revenue was from sales to customers who have headquarters located outside the United States, while over 80% of our revenue in 2023 was from products shipped to customer locations outside the United States.\nOur international operations are subject to a number of risks, including:\nrestrictions on sales of goods or services to one or more of our significant foreign customers;\nexport and import duties, changes to import and export regulations, customs regulations and processes, and restrictions on the transfer of funds, including currency controls in China, which could negatively affect the amount and timing of payments from certain of our customers and, as a result, our cash flows;\ncompliance with U.S. and international laws involving international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, sanctions and anti-corruption laws, export and import laws, and similar rules and regulations;\ntheft of intellectual property;\npolitical and economic instability, including instability resulting from domestic and international conflicts;\ngovernment actions or civil unrest preventing the flow of products and materials, including delays in shipping and obtaining products and materials, cancellation of orders, or loss or damage of products;\nproblems with the transportation or delivery of products and materials;\nissues arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest;\nlonger payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;\ncompliance with trade, technical standards, and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions;\ncontractual and regulatory limitations on the ability to maintain flexibility with staffing levels;\ndisruptions to manufacturing or R&D activities as a result of actions imposed by foreign governments;\nchanges in economic policies of foreign governments;\ndifficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and\npublic health issues.\nIf we or our customers, suppliers, or vendors are impacted by any of these risks, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n23 | 2023 10-K\nFollowing the May 21, 2023 decision of its cybersecurity review of our products sold in China, the CAC determined that critical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products, impacting our revenue with companies headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong, including direct sales as well as indirect sales through distributors. Some revenue with customers headquartered outside of China has also been impacted. As we try to mitigate possible impacts due to the CAC decision, revenue may come at lower prices or gross margins due to product or customer mix changes, which may impact our business results. Further actions by the Chinese government could impact additional revenue inside or outside China, or our operations in China, or our ability to ship products to our customers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nPolitical, economic, or other actions may adversely affect our operations in Taiwan. A majority of our DRAM production output in 2023 was from our fabrication facilities in Taiwan and any loss of output could have a material adverse effect on us. Any political, economic, or other actions may also adversely affect our customers and the technology industry supply chain, for which Taiwan is a central hub, and as a result, could have a material adverse impact on us.\nIn addition, the U.S. government has in the past restricted American firms from selling products and software to certain of our customers and may in the future impose similar restrictions on one or more of our significant customers. These restrictions may not prohibit our competitors from selling similar products to our customers, which may result in our loss of sales and market share. Even as such restrictions are lifted, financial or other penalties or continuing export restrictions imposed with respect to our customers could have a continuing negative impact on our future revenue and results of operations, and we may not be able to recover any customers or market share we lose, or make such recoveries at acceptable average selling prices, while complying with such restrictions.\nThe semiconductor memory and storage markets are highly competitive.\nWe face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies, including Kioxia Holdings Corporation; Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.; SK hynix Inc.; and Western Digital Corporation. Our competitors may use aggressive pricing to obtain market share. Some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have a larger market share and greater resources to invest in technology, capitalize on growth opportunities, and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete. Consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage as our competitors may benefit from increased manufacturing scale and a stronger product portfolio. We operate in different jurisdictions than our competitors and may be impacted by unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.\nIn addition, some governments may provide, or have provided and may continue to provide, significant assistance, financial or otherwise, to some of our competitors or to new entrants and may intervene in support of national industries and/or competitors. In particular, we face the threat of increasing competition as a result of significant investment in the semiconductor industry by the Chinese government and various state-owned or affiliated entities, in companies such as Yangtze Memory Technologies Co., Ltd. (YMTC) and ChangXin Memory Technologies, Inc. (CXMT). In addition, the CACs decision that critical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products had an impact on our ability to compete effectively in China and elsewhere.\nWe and our competitors generally seek to increase wafer output, improve yields, and reduce die size, which could result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage also result from fabrication capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization, or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory and storage production. Our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. We, and some of our competitors, have plans to ramp, or are constructing or ramping, production at new fabrication facilities. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage, if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand, could lead to declines in average selling prices for our products and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. If competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology, their products could have cost or performance advantages.\nThe competitive nature of our industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur future success depends on our ability to develop and produce new and competitive memory and storage technologies and products.\nOur key semiconductor memory and storage technologies face technological barriers to continue to meet long-term customer needs. These barriers include potential limitations on stacking additional 3D memory layers, increasing bits per cell (i.e., cell levels), meeting higher density requirements, improving power consumption and reliability, and delivering advanced features and higher performance. We may face technological barriers to continue to shrink our products at our current or historical rate, which has generally reduced per gigabit cost. We have invested and expect to continue to invest in R&D for new and existing products and process technologies, such as EUV lithography, to continue to deliver advanced product requirements. Such new technologies can add complexity and risk to our schedule and may affect our costs and production output. We may be unable to recover our investment in R&D or otherwise realize the economic benefits of reducing die size or increasing memory and storage densities. Our competitors are working to develop new memory and storage technologies that may offer performance and/or cost advantages to existing technologies and render existing technologies obsolete. Accordingly, our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory and storage technologies.\nWe are developing new products, including system-level memory and storage products and solutions, which complement our traditional products or leverage their underlying design or process technology. We have invested and expect to continue to invest in new semiconductor product and system-level solution development. We are increasingly differentiating our products and solutions to meet the specific demands of our customers, which increases our reliance on our customers ability to accurately forecast the needs and preferences of their customers. As a result, our product demand forecasts may be impacted significantly by the strategic actions of our customers. In addition, our ability to successfully introduce new products often requires us to make product specification decisions multiple years in advance of when new products enter the market.\nIt is important that we deliver products in a timely manner with increasingly advanced performance characteristics at the time our customers are designing and evaluating samples for their products. If we do not meet their product design schedules, our customers may exclude us from further consideration as a supplier for those products. The process to develop new products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality, performance, and reliability, often well in advance of a planned ramp of production, in order to secure design wins with our customers. Many factors may negatively impact our ability to meet anticipated timelines and/or expected or required quality standards with respect to the development of certain of our products. In addition, some of our components have long lead-times, requiring us to place orders up to a year in advance of anticipated demand. Such long lead-times increase the risk of excess inventory or loss of sales in the event our forecasts vary substantially from actual demand.\nThere can be no assurance of the following:\nwe will be successful in developing competitive new semiconductor memory and storage technologies and products;\nwe will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products;\nwe will be able to successfully market these technologies;\nmargins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts;\nwe will be able to establish or maintain key relationships with customers, or that we will not be prohibited from working with certain customers, for specific chip set or design requirements;\nwe will accurately predict and design products that meet our customers' specifications; or\nwe will be able to introduce new products into the market and qualify them with our customers on a timely basis.\nUnsuccessful efforts to develop new memory and storage technologies and products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n25 | 2023 10-K\nWe may not be able to achieve expected returns from capacity expansions.\nWe have announced our intent to expand our production capacity and/or make capital investments in the United States and in other regions where we operate.\nThese expansions involve several risks including the following:\ncapital expenditure requirements for capacity expansions during periods of relatively low free cash flow generation, resulting from challenging memory and storage industry conditions;\navailability of necessary funding, which may include external sources;\nability to realize expected grants, investment tax credits, and other government incentives, including through the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 (CHIPS Act) and other national, international, state, and local grants;\npotential changes in laws or provisions of grants, investment tax credits, and other government incentives;\npotential restrictions on expanding in certain geographies;\navailability of equipment and construction materials;\nability to complete construction as scheduled and within budget;\navailability of the necessary workforce;\nability to timely ramp production in a cost-effective manner;\nincreases to our cost structure until new production is ramped to adequate scale; and\nsufficient customer demand to utilize our increased capacity.\nWe invest our capital in areas that we believe best align with our business strategy and optimize future returns. Investments in capital expenditures may not generate expected returns or cash flows. Significant judgment is required to determine which capital investments will result in optimal returns, and we could invest in projects that are ultimately less profitable than those projects we do not select. Delays in completion and ramping of new production facilities, or failure to optimize our investment choices, could significantly impact our ability to realize expected returns on our capital expenditures.\nAny of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur incentives from various governments are conditional upon achieving or maintaining certain performance or other obligations and are subject to reduction, termination, clawback, or could impose certain limitations on our business.\nWe have received, and may in the future continue to receive, benefits and incentives from national, state, and local governments in various regions of the world designed to encourage us to establish, maintain, or increase investment, workforce, or production in those regions. These incentives may take various forms, including grants, loan subsidies, and tax arrangements, and typically require us to achieve or maintain certain levels of investment, capital spending, employment, technology deployment, or research and development activities to qualify for such incentives or could restrict us from undertaking certain activities. We may be unable to obtain significant future incentives to continue to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and operating costs, without which our cost structure would be adversely impacted. We also cannot guarantee that we will successfully achieve performance or other obligations required to qualify for these incentives or that the granting agencies will provide such funding. These incentive arrangements typically provide the granting agencies with rights to audit our compliance with their terms and obligations. Such audits could result in modifications to, or termination of, the applicable incentive program. The incentives we receive could be subject to reduction, termination, or clawback, and any decrease or clawback of government incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur business, results of operations, or financial condition could be adversely affected by the availability and quality of materials, supplies, and capital equipment, or dependency on third-party service providers.\nOur supply chain and operations are dependent on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and the use of third parties to provide us with components and services. We generally have multiple sources of supply for our materials and services. However, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain materials, components, and services that meet our standards and, in some cases, materials, components, or services are provided by a single or sole source, and we may be unable to qualify new suppliers on a timely basis. The availability of materials or components such as chemicals, silicon wafers, gases, photoresist, controllers, substrates, lead frames, printed circuit boards, targets, and reticle glass blanks is impacted by various factors. These factors could include a shortage of raw materials or a disruption in the processing or purification of those raw materials into finished goods. Shortages or increases in lead times have occurred in the past, are currently occurring with respect to some materials and components, and may occur from time to time in the future. Constraints within our supply chain for certain materials and integrated circuit components could limit our bit shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with third-party manufacturers of controllers, analog integrated circuits, and other components used in some of our products and with outsourced semiconductor foundries, assembly and test providers, contract manufacturers, logistics carriers, and other service providers, including providers of electricity and other utilities. Although we have certain long-term contracts with some of our suppliers, many of these contracts do not provide for long-term capacity or pricing commitments. To the extent we do not have firm commitments from our third-party suppliers over a specific time period or for any specific capacity, quantity, and/or pricing, our suppliers may allocate capacity to their other customers and capacity and/or materials may not be available when needed or at reasonable prices. Inflationary pressures have increased, and may continue to increase costs for materials, supplies, and services. Regardless of contract structure, large swings in demand may exceed our contracted supply and/or our suppliers capacity to meet those demand changes resulting in a shortage of parts, materials, or capacity needed to manufacture our products. In addition, if any of our suppliers was to cease operations or become insolvent, this could impact their ability to provide us with necessary supplies, and we may not be able to obtain the needed supply in a timely way or at all from other providers.\nCertain materials are primarily available in a limited number of countries, including rare earth elements, minerals, and metals. Trade disputes, geopolitical tensions, economic circumstances, political conditions, or public health issues may limit our ability to obtain such materials. Although these rare earth and other materials are generally available from multiple suppliers, China is the predominant producer of certain of these materials. If China were to restrict or stop exporting these materials, our suppliers ability to obtain such supply may be constrained and we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities, or obtain supply in a timely manner, or at a commercially reasonable cost. Constrained supply of rare earth elements, minerals, and metals may restrict our ability to manufacture certain of our products and make it difficult or impossible to compete with other semiconductor memory and storage manufacturers who are able to obtain sufficient quantities of these materials from China.\nWe and/or our suppliers and service providers could be affected by regional conflicts, civil unrest, labor disruptions, sanctions, tariffs, embargoes, or other trade restrictions, as well as laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change, conflict minerals, responsible sourcing practices, public health crises, or other matters, which could limit the supply of our materials and/or increase the cost. Environmental regulations could limit our ability to procure or use certain chemicals or materials in our operations or products. In addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of materials. Our ability to procure components to repair equipment essential for our manufacturing processes could also be negatively impacted by various restrictions or disruptions in supply chains, among other items. The disruption of our supply of materials, components, or services, or the extension of our lead times could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n27 | 2023 10-K\nOur operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes. For certain key types of equipment, including photolithography tools, we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier. From time to time, we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to suppliers limited capacity. Our inability to obtain equipment on a timely basis could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce our costs. Delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production and could increase our overall costs of a ramp. Our inability to obtain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur construction projects to expand production and R&D capacity are highly dependent on available sources of labor, materials, equipment, and services. Increasing demand, supply constraints, inflation, and other market conditions could result in increasing shortages and higher costs for these items. Difficulties in obtaining these resources could result in significant delays in completion of our construction projects and cost increases, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur inability to source materials, supplies, capital equipment, or third-party services could affect our overall production output and our ability to fulfill customer demand. Significant or prolonged shortages of our products could halt customer manufacturing and damage our relationships with these customers. Any damage to our customer relationships as a result of a shortage of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nSimilarly, if our customers experience disruptions to their supplies, materials, components, or services, or the extension of their lead times, they may reduce, cancel, or alter the timing of their purchases with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nDownturns in regional or worldwide economies may harm our business.\nDownturns in regional or worldwide economies, due to inflation, geopolitics, major central bank policy actions including interest rate increases, public health crises, or other factors, have harmed our business in the past and current and future downturns could also adversely affect our business. Adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products, such as personal computers, smartphones, automobiles, and servers. Reduced demand for these or other products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales. In addition, to the extent our customers or distributors have elevated inventory levels or are impacted by a deterioration in credit markets, we may experience a decrease in short-term and/or long-term demand resulting in industry oversupply and declines in pricing for our products.\nA deterioration of conditions in regional or worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures. In addition, we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties. Difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivable due to credit defaults. As a result, downturns in regional or worldwide economies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nIf our manufacturing process is disrupted by operational issues, natural disasters, or other events, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe and our subcontractors manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance. Difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs. We and our subcontractors maintain operations and continuously implement new product and process technology at manufacturing facilities, which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the United States, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia, and China. As a result of the necessary interdependence within our network of manufacturing facilities, an operational disruption at one of our or a subcontractors facilities may have a disproportionate impact on our ability to produce many of our products.\nFrom time to time, there have been disruptions in our manufacturing operations as a result of power outages, improperly functioning equipment, disruptions in supply of raw materials or components, or equipment failures. We have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences and possible climate changes, such as severe and variable weather and geological events resulting in increased costs, or disruptions to our manufacturing operations or those of our suppliers or customers. In addition, climate change may pose physical risks to our manufacturing facilities or our suppliers facilities, including increased extreme weather events that could result in supply delays or disruptions. Other events, including political or public health crises, such as an outbreak of contagious diseases, may also affect our production capabilities or that of our suppliers, including as a result of quarantines, closures of production facilities, lack of supplies, or delays caused by restrictions on travel or shipping. Events of the types noted above have occurred from time to time and may occur in the future. As a result, in addition to disruptions to operations, our insurance premiums may increase or we may not be able to fully recover any sustained losses through insurance.\nIf production is disrupted for any reason, manufacturing yields may be adversely affected, or we may be unable to meet our customers requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers. This could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs, loss of revenue, or damage to customer relationships, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nA significant portion of our revenue is concentrated with a select number of customers.\nIn each of the last three years, approximately one-half of our total revenue was from our top ten customers. A disruption in our relationship with any of these customers could adversely affect our business. We could experience fluctuations in our customer base or the mix of revenue by customer as markets and strategies evolve. Our customers demand for our products may fluctuate due to factors beyond our control. In addition, any consolidation of our customers could reduce the number of customers to whom our products may be sold. Our inability to meet our customers requirements or to qualify our products with them could adversely impact our revenue. A meaningful change in the inventory strategy of our customers could impact our industry bit demand growth outlook. The loss of, or restrictions on our ability to sell to, one or more of our major customers, or any significant reduction in orders from, or a shift in product mix by, customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nIncreases in sales of system solutions may increase our dependency upon specific customers and our costs to develop, qualify, and manufacture our system solutions.\nOur development of system-level memory and storage products is dependent, in part, upon successfully identifying and meeting our customers specifications for those products. Developing and manufacturing system-level products with specifications unique to a customer increases our reliance upon that customer for purchasing our products at sufficient volumes and prices in a timely manner. Even if our products meet customer specifications, our sales of system-level solutions are dependent upon our customers choosing our products over those of our competitors and purchasing our products at sufficient volumes and prices. Our competitors products may be less costly, provide better performance, or include additional features when compared to our products. Our long-term ability to sell system-level memory and storage products is reliant upon our customers ability to create, market, and sell their products containing our system-level solutions at sufficient volumes and prices in a timely manner. If we fail to successfully develop and market system-level products, our business, results of operations, or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\n29 | 2023 10-K\nManufacturing system-level solutions, such as SSDs, managed NAND, and HBM, typically results in higher per-unit manufacturing costs as compared to other products. Even if we are successful in selling system-level solutions to our customers in sufficient volume, we may be unable to generate sufficient profit if our per-unit manufacturing costs are not offset by higher per-unit selling prices. Manufacturing system-level solutions to customer specifications requires a longer development cycle, as compared to discrete products, to design, test, and qualify, which may increase our costs. Some of our system solutions are increasingly dependent on sophisticated firmware that may require significant customization to meet customer specifications, which increases our costs and time to market. Additionally, we may need to update our controller and hardware design as well as our firmware or develop new firmware as a result of new product introductions or changes in customer specifications and/or industry standards, which increases our costs. System complexities and extended warranties for system-level products could also increase our warranty costs. Our failure to cost-effectively manufacture system-level solutions and/or controller, hardware design, and firmware in a timely manner may result in reduced demand for our system-level products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nProducts that fail to meet specifications, are defective, or are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us.\nProducts that do not meet specifications or that contain, or are perceived by our customers to contain, defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. From time to time, we experience problems with nonconforming, defective, or incompatible products after we have shipped such products. In recent periods, we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings, which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application. Our products and solutions may be deemed fully or partially responsible for functionality in our customers products and may result in sharing or shifting of product or financial liability from our customers to us for costs incurred by the end user as a result of our customers products failing to perform as specified. In addition, if our products and solutions perform critical functions in our customers products or are used in high-risk consumer end products, such as autonomous driver assistance programs, home and enterprise security, smoke and noxious gas detectors, medical monitoring equipment, or wearables for child and elderly safety, our potential liability may increase. We could be adversely affected in several ways, including the following:\nwe may be required or agree to compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible products and to replace products;\nwe could incur a decrease in revenue or adjustment to pricing commensurate with the reimbursement of such costs or alleged damages; and\nwe may encounter adverse publicity, which could cause a decrease in sales of our products or harm our reputation or relationships with existing or potential customers.\nAny of the foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nBreaches of our security systems or products, or those of our customers, suppliers, or business partners, could expose us to losses.\nWe maintain a system of controls over the physical security of our facilities. We also manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations. In addition, we process, store, and transmit large amounts of data relating to our customers and employees, including sensitive personal information. Unauthorized persons, employees, former employees, nation states, or other parties may gain access to our facilities or technology infrastructure and systems to steal trade secrets or other proprietary information, compromise confidential information, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. This risk is exacerbated as competitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, attempt to hire our employees. Through cyberattacks on technology infrastructure and systems, unauthorized parties may obtain access to computer systems, networks, and data, including cloud-based platforms. The technology infrastructure and systems of our suppliers, vendors, service providers, cloud solution providers, and partners have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, such attacks, which could impact our operations. Cyberattacks can include ransomware, computer denial-of-service attacks, worms, supply chain attacks, social engineering, open source vulnerabilities, and other malicious software programs or other attacks, including those using techniques that change frequently or may be disguised or difficult to detect, or designed to remain dormant until a triggering event, impersonation of authorized users, and efforts to discover and exploit any design flaws, bugs, security vulnerabilities, as well as intentional or unintentional acts by employees or other insiders with access privileges. Additionally, some actors are using artificial intelligence technology to launch more automated, targeted and coordinated attacks. Globally, cyberattacks are increasing in number and the attackers are increasingly organized and well-financed, or supported by state actors, and are developing increasingly sophisticated systems to not only attack, but also to evade detection. In addition, geopolitical tensions or conflicts may create a heightened risk of cyberattacks. Breaches of our physical security, attacks on our technology infrastructure and systems, or breaches or attacks on our customers, suppliers, or business partners who have confidential or sensitive information regarding us and our customers and suppliers, could result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers and suppliers and may expose us to litigation if the confidential information of our customers, suppliers, or employees is compromised.\nOur products are also targets for cyberattacks, including those products utilized in cloud-based environments. While some of our products contain encryption or security algorithms to protect third-party content or user-generated data stored on our products, these products could still be hacked or the encryption schemes could be compromised, breached, or circumvented by motivated and sophisticated attackers. Further, our products contain sophisticated hardware and firmware and applications that may contain security vulnerabilities or defects in design or manufacture, including bugs and other problems that could interfere with the intended operation of our products. To the extent our products are hacked, or the encryption schemes are compromised or breached, this could harm our business by requiring us to employ additional resources to fix the errors or defects, exposing us to litigation, claims, and harm to our reputation.\nAny of the foregoing security risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe must attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled employees.\nTo remain competitive, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and other highly skilled, diverse employees, as well as effectively manage succession for key employees. Competition for experienced employees in our industry can be intense. Hiring and retaining qualified executives and other employees is critical to our business. If our total compensation programs, employment benefits, and workplace culture are not viewed as competitive and inclusive, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees could be compromised.\nAt times, we experience higher levels of attrition, increasing compensation costs, and more intense competition for talent across our industry. To the extent we experience significant attrition and are unable to timely replace employees, we could experience a loss of critical skills and reduced employee morale, potentially resulting in business disruptions or increased expenses to address any disruptions. Additionally, changes to immigration policies in the countries in which we operate, as well as restrictions on travel due to public health crises or other causes, may limit our ability to hire and/or retain talent in, or transfer talent to, specific locations.\nOur inability to attract, retain, and motivate executives and other employees or effectively manage succession of key roles may inhibit our ability to maintain or expand our business operations.\n31 | 2023 10-K\nCompliance with responsible sourcing requirements and any related regulations could increase our operating costs, or limit the supply and increase the cost of certain materials, supplies, and services, and if we fail to comply, customers may reduce purchases from us or disqualify us as a supplier.\nWe and many of our customers have adopted responsible sourcing programs that require us to meet certain environmental, social and governance criteria, and to periodically report on our performance against these requirements, including that we source the materials, supplies, and services we use and incorporate into the products we sell as prescribed by these programs. Many customer programs require us to remove a supplier within a prescribed period if such supplier ceases to comply with prescribed criteria, and our supply chain may at any time contain suppliers at risk of being removed due to non-compliance with responsible sourcing requirements. Some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier (resulting in a permanent or temporary loss of sales to such customer) or reduce purchases from us if we are unable to verify that our performance or products (including the underlying supply chain) meet the specifications of our customers responsible sourcing programs on a continuous basis. Meeting responsible sourcing requirements may increase operating requirements and costs or limit the sourcing and availability of some of the materials, supplies, and services we use, particularly when the availability of such materials, supplies, and services is concentrated to a limited number of suppliers. From time to time, we remove suppliers or require our suppliers to remove suppliers from their supply chains based on our responsible sourcing requirements or customer requirements, and we or our suppliers may be unable to replace such removed suppliers in a timely or cost-effective manner. Any inability to replace removed suppliers in a timely or cost effective manner may affect our ability and/or the cost to obtain sufficient quantities of materials, supplies, and services necessary for the manufacture of our products. Our inability to replace suppliers we have removed in a timely or cost-effective manner or comply with customers responsible sourcing requirements or with any related regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nFailure to meet environmental, social, and governance expectations or standards or achieve our related goals could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price.\nIn recent years, there has been an increased focus from stakeholders on environmental, social, and governance matters, including greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related risks, sustainability, renewable energy, water stewardship, waste management, diversity, equality and inclusion, responsible sourcing and supply chain, human rights, and social responsibility. Given our commitment to relevant social and environmental issues as it relates to our business, we actively manage these issues and have established and publicly announced certain goals, commitments, and targets which we may refine or even expand further in the future. These goals, commitments, and targets reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Achieving these goals may entail significant costs, for example we have entered into several virtual power purchase agreements to obtain renewable energy credits at a cost that will vary based on future prices for electrical power. Evolving stakeholder expectations and our efforts to manage these issues, report on them, and accomplish our goals present numerous operational, regulatory, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks, any of which could have a material adverse impact, including on our reputation and stock price.\nSuch risks and uncertainties include:\nreputational harm, including damage to our relationships with customers, suppliers, investors, governments, or other stakeholders;\nadverse impacts on our ability to manufacture and sell products and maintain our market share;\nthe success of our collaborations with third parties;\nincreased risk of litigation, investigations, or regulatory enforcement action;\nunfavorable environmental, social, and governance ratings or investor sentiment;\ndiversion of resources and increased costs to control, assess, and report on environmental, social, and governance metrics;\nour ability to achieve our goals, commitments, and targets within timeframes announced;\nincreased costs to achieve our goals, commitments, and targets;\nunforeseen operational and technological difficulties;\naccess to and increased cost of capital; and\nadverse impacts on our stock price.\nAny failure, or perceived failure, to meet evolving stakeholder expectations and industry standards or achieve our environmental, social, and governance goals, commitments, and targets could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price.\nAcquisitions and/or alliances involve numerous risks.\nAcquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances, such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements, involve numerous risks, including the following:\nintegrating the operations, technologies, and products of acquired or newly formed entities into our operations;\nincreasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilities;\nincreased debt levels;\nthe assumption of unknown or underestimated liabilities;\nthe use of cash to finance a transaction, which may reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, R&D expenditures, and other business activities;\ndiverting managements attention from daily operations;\nmanaging larger or more complex operations and facilities and employees in separate and diverse geographic areas;\nhiring and retaining key employees;\nrequirements imposed by government authorities in connection with the regulatory review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired business;\nunderestimating the costs or overestimating the benefits, including product, revenue, cost and other synergies and growth opportunities that we expect to realize, and we may not achieve those benefits;\nfailure to maintain customer, vendor, and other relationships;\ninadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired companys internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, compliance programs, and/or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices; and\nimpairment of acquired intangible assets, goodwill, or other assets as a result of changing business conditions or technological advancements.\nThe global memory and storage industry has experienced consolidation and may continue to consolidate. We engage, from time to time, in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities. To the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions, we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above. Acquisitions of, or alliances with, technology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe have incurred restructure charges and may incur restructure charges in future periods and may not realize expected savings or other benefits from restructure plans.\nIn 2023, we initiated a restructure plan in response to current market conditions. See Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Restructure and Asset Impairments and Part II - Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview. In addition, we may in the future enter into other restructure initiatives in order to, among other items, streamline our operations, respond to changes in business conditions, our markets, or product offerings, or to centralize certain key functions.\nWe may not realize expected savings or other benefits from our current or future restructure activities and may incur additional restructure charges or other losses in future periods associated with other initiatives. In connection with any restructure initiatives, we could incur restructure charges, loss of production output, loss of key personnel, disruptions in our operations, and difficulties in the timely delivery of products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n33 | 2023 10-K\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property and Litigation\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property or retain key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property.\nWe maintain a system of controls over our intellectual property, including U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, licensing arrangements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with employees, consultants, and vendors, and a general system of internal controls. Despite our system of controls over our intellectual property, it may be possible for our current or future competitors to obtain, copy, use, or disclose, illegally or otherwise, our product and process technology or other proprietary information. The laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same degree as do U.S. laws, and our confidentiality, non-disclosure, and non-compete agreements may be unenforceable or difficult and costly to enforce.\nAdditionally, our ability to maintain and develop intellectual property is dependent upon our ability to attract, develop, and retain highly skilled employees. If our competitors or future entrants into our industry are successful in hiring our employees, they may directly benefit from the knowledge these employees gained while they were under our employment, and this may also negatively impact our ability to maintain and develop intellectual property.\nOur inability to protect our intellectual property or retain key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nLegal proceedings and claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business or otherwise, both domestically and internationally. Such claims include, but are not limited to, allegations of anticompetitive conduct and infringement of intellectual property. See Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Contingencies.\nAny claim, with or without merit, could result in significant legal fees that could negatively impact our financial results, disrupt our operations, and require significant attention from our management. We may be associated with and subject to litigation, claims, or arbitration disputes arising from, or as a result of:\nour relationships with vendors or customers, supply agreements, or contractual obligations with our subcontractors or business partners;\nthe actions of our vendors, subcontractors, or business partners;\nour indemnification obligations, including obligations to defend our customers against third-party claims asserting infringement of certain intellectual property rights, which may include patents, trademarks, copyrights, or trade secrets; and\nthe terms of our product warranties or from product liability claims.\nAs we continue to focus on developing system solutions with manufacturers of consumer products, including autonomous driving, augmented reality, and others, we may be exposed to greater potential for personal liability claims against us as a result of consumers use of those products. We, our officers, or our directors could also be subject to claims of alleged violations of securities laws. There can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities, and we may elect to self-insure with respect to certain matters. Exposures to various legal proceedings and claims could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend claims, are required to pay damage awards, or enter into settlement agreements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nClaims that our products or manufacturing processes infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others, or failure to obtain or renew license agreements covering such intellectual property, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nAs is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries, from time to time others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that our products or manufacturing processes infringe upon, misappropriate, misuse, or otherwise violate their intellectual property rights. We are unable to predict the outcome of these assertions made against us. Any of these types of claims, regardless of the merits, could subject us to significant costs to defend or resolve such claims and may consume a substantial portion of managements time and attention. As a result of these claims, we may be required to:\npay significant monetary damages, fines, royalties, or penalties;\nenter into license or settlement agreements covering such intellectual property rights;\nmake material changes to or redesign our products and/or manufacturing processes; and/or\ncease manufacturing, having made, selling, offering for sale, importing, marketing, or using products and/or manufacturing processes in certain jurisdictions.\nWe may not be able to take any of the actions described above on commercially reasonable terms and any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. See Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Contingencies.\nWe have a number of intellectual property license agreements. Some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments. We may need to obtain additional licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future. We are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to us. The failure to obtain or renew licenses as necessary could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nGovernment actions and regulations, such as export restrictions, tariffs, and trade protection measures, may limit our ability to sell our products to certain customers or markets, or could otherwise restrict our ability to conduct operations.\nInternational trade disputes, geopolitical tensions, and military conflicts have led, and continue to lead, to new and increasing export restrictions, trade barriers, tariffs, and other trade measures that can increase our manufacturing costs, make our products less competitive, reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to sell to certain customers or markets, limit our ability to procure, or increase our costs for, components or raw materials, impede or slow the movement of our goods across borders, impede our ability to perform R&D activities, or otherwise restrict our ability to conduct operations. Increasing protectionism, economic nationalism, and national security concerns may lead to further changes in trade policy, domestic sourcing initiatives, or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in, or restrict our access to, some markets and/or customers. For example, following the May 21, 2023 decision of its cybersecurity review of our products sold in China, the CAC determined that critical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products, impacting our revenue with companies headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong, including direct sales as well as indirect sales through distributors. Some revenue with customers headquartered outside of China has also been impacted. Further actions by the Chinese government could impact additional revenue inside or outside China, or our operations in China, or our ability to ship products to our customers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n35 | 2023 10-K\nWe cannot predict what further actions may ultimately be taken with respect to export regulations, tariffs, or other trade regulations between the United States and other countries, what products or companies may be subject to such actions, or what actions may be taken by other countries in retaliation. Further changes in trade policy, tariffs, restrictions on exports or other trade barriers, or restrictions on supplies, equipment, and raw materials including rare earth minerals, may limit our ability to produce products, increase our selling and/or manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies. Such changes may also result in reputational harm to us, the development or adoption of technologies that compete with our products, long-term changes in global trade and technology supply chains, or negative impacts on our customers products which incorporate our solutions. Any of the effects described in this risk factor could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nThe technology industry is subject to intense media, political, and regulatory scrutiny, which can increase our exposure to government investigations, legal actions, and penalties. Although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, or agents will not violate such laws or our policies. Violations of trade laws, restrictions, or regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us or our officers, directors, or employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation.\nTax-related matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including changes in the geographic mix of our earnings among jurisdictions, challenges by tax authorities to our tax positions and intercompany transfer pricing arrangements, failure to meet performance obligations with respect to tax incentive agreements, expanding our operations in various countries, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, adverse resolution of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns, and changes in tax laws and regulations.\nChanges to income tax laws and regulations, or the interpretation of such laws, in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flows from operating activities and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Beginning in 2024, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 imposes a 15% book minimum tax on corporations with three-year average annual adjusted financial statement income exceeding $1 billion. The impact of this tax will depend on our facts in each year, anticipated guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and other developing global tax legislation. Further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In December 2022, the European Union (EU) member states reached an agreement to implement the minimum tax component (Pillar Two) of the OECDs tax reform initiative. The directive is expected to be enacted into the national law of the EU member states by December 31, 2023. If similar directives under Pillar Two are adopted by taxing authorities in other countries where we do business, such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe and others are subject to a variety of complex and evolving laws, regulations, or industry standards, including with respect to environmental, health, safety, and product considerations, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nThe manufacture of our products requires the use of facilities, equipment, chemicals, and materials that are subject to a broad array of laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. Additionally, we are subject to a variety of other laws and regulations relative to the construction, maintenance, and operations of our facilities. Any changes in laws, regulations, or industry standards could cause us to incur additional direct costs, as well as increased indirect costs related to our relationships with our customers and suppliers, and otherwise harm our operations and financial condition. Any failure to comply with laws, regulations, or industry standards could adversely impact our reputation and our financial results. Additionally, we engage various third parties as sales channel partners or to represent us or otherwise act on our behalf who are also subject to a broad array of laws, regulations, and industry standards. Our engagement with these third parties may also expose us to risks associated with their respective compliance with laws and regulations.\nNew and evolving environmental health, safety, and product considerations, including those related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, the purchase, use and disposal of regulated and/or hazardous chemicals, and the potential resulting environmental, health or safety impacts, may result in new laws, regulations, or industry standards that may affect us, our suppliers, and our customers. Such laws, regulations, or industry standards could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers, or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a result of the considerations detailed in this risk factor, we could experience the following:\nsuspension of production or sales of our products;\nlimited supplies of chemicals or materials used to make our products;\nremediation costs;\nincreased compliance costs;\nalteration of our manufacturing processes;\nregulatory penalties, fines, civil or criminal sanctions, and other legal liabilities; and\nreputational challenges.\nCompliance with, or our failure, or the failure of our third-party sales channel partners or agents, to comply with, laws, regulations, or industry standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Capitalization and Financial Markets\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations, make scheduled debt payments, pay our dividend, and make adequate capital investments.\nOur cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory and storage products sold, average selling prices, and manufacturing costs. To develop new product and process technology, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology, capital equipment, facilities, R&D, and product and process technology. We estimate capital expenditures in 2024 for property, plant, and equipment, net of partner contributions, to be slightly above $7 billion.\nIn the past, we have utilized external sources of financing when needed. As a result of our debt levels, expected debt amortization, prevailing interest rates, and general capital market and other economic conditions, it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. We have experienced volatility in our cash flows and operating results and we expect to continue to experience such volatility in the future, which may negatively affect our credit rating. Our credit rating may also be affected by our liquidity, financial results, economic risk, or other factors, which may increase the cost of borrowings and make it difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. There can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows, access capital or credit markets, or find other sources of financing to fund our operations, make debt payments, refinance our debt, pay our quarterly dividend, and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency. Our inability to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n37 | 2023 10-K\nDebt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe have incurred in the past, and expect to incur in the future, debt to finance our capital investments, business acquisitions, and to realign our capital structure. As of August 31, 2023, we had debt with a carrying value of $13.33 billion and may incur additional debt, including under our $2.50 billion Revolving Credit Facility. Our debt obligations could adversely impact us as follows:\nrequire us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt, which will reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund our business activities;\nadversely impact our credit rating, which could increase borrowing costs;\nlimit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, R&D, and other general corporate requirements;\nrestrict our ability to incur specified indebtedness, create or incur certain liens, and enter into sale-leaseback financing transactions;\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\nincrease our exposure to rising interest rates from variable rate indebtedness; and\nresult in certain of our debt instruments becoming immediately due and payable or being deemed to be in default if applicable cross default, cross-acceleration and/or similar provisions are triggered.\nOur ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flows or obtain external financing in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to market, economic, financial, competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that additional capital will be available to us, in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. Additionally, events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy applicable draw-down conditions and utilize our Revolving Credit Facility. In light of industry conditions, in 2023, we amended the financial covenants in our Revolving Credit Facility and term loan agreements. See Part II - Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview - Industry Conditions and Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Debt. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows to service our debt payment obligations or satisfy our debt covenants, we may need to refinance, restructure, or amend the terms of our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nAcross our global operations, significant transactions and balances are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency), primarily the Chinese yuan, euro, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Malaysian ringgit, New Taiwan dollar, and Singapore dollar. In addition, a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in foreign currencies. Exchange rates for some of these currencies against the U.S. dollar have been volatile and may be volatile in future periods. If these currencies strengthen against the U.S. dollar, our manufacturing costs could significantly increase. Exchange rates for the U.S. dollar that adversely change against our foreign currency exposures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe are subject to counterparty default risks.\nWe have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks, including cash deposits, investments, and derivative instruments. Additionally, we are subject to counterparty default risk from our customers for amounts receivable from them. As a result, we are subject to the risk that the counterparty will default on its performance obligations. A counterparty may not comply with its contractual commitments which could then lead to its defaulting on its obligations with little or no notice to us, which could limit our ability to mitigate our exposure. Additionally, our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action. If one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterpartys default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of such default, we could incur significant losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.\nOur common stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, we, the technology industry, and the stock market as a whole have on occasion experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to the specific operating performance of individual companies. The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely due to various factors, including, but not limited to, actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results, changes in financial forecasts or estimates by us or financial or other market estimates and ratings by securities and other analysts, changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public, interest rate changes, regulatory changes, news regarding our products or products of our competitors, and broad market and industry fluctuations.\nFor these reasons, investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future trading prices of our common stock, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Investors in our common stock may not realize any return on their investment in us and may lose some or all of their investment. Volatility in the trading price of our common stock could also result in the filing of securities class action litigation matters, which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources.\nThe amount and frequency of our share repurchases may fluctuate, and we cannot guarantee that we will fully consummate our share repurchase authorization, or that it will enhance long-term shareholder value. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will diminish our cash reserves.\nThe amount, frequency, and execution of our share repurchases pursuant to our share repurchase authorization may fluctuate based on our operating results, cash flows, and priorities for the use of cash for other purposes. Our expenditures for share repurchases were $425 million in 2023, $2.43 billion in 2022, $1.20 billion in 2021. These other purposes include, but are not limited to, operational spending, capital spending, acquisitions, and repayment of debt. Other factors, including changes in tax laws, could also impact our share repurchases. Although our Board of Directors has authorized share repurchases of up to $10 billion of our outstanding common stock, the authorization does not obligate us to repurchase any common stock.\nWe cannot guarantee that our share repurchase authorization will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term shareholder value. The repurchase authorization could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility, and any announcement of a pause in, or termination of, this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock. In addition, this program will diminish our cash reserves.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends in any particular amounts or at all.\nOur Board of Directors has adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we currently pay a cash dividend on our common shares on a quarterly basis. The declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the approval of our Board of Directors and our dividend may be discontinued or reduced at any time. There can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends in the future in any particular amounts, or at all.\n39 | 2023 10-K\nFuture dividends, if any, and their timing and amount, may be affected by, among other factors: our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions, debt service obligations, contractual restrictions, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Boise, Idaho. In addition to our principal facilities described below, we own or lease numerous other facilities in locations throughout the world used for design, R&D, and sales and marketing activities. The following is a summary of our principal facilities as of August 31, 2023:\nLocation Principal Operations\nTaiwan R&D, wafer fabrication, component assembly and test, module assembly and test\nSingapore R&D, wafer fabrication, component assembly and test, module assembly and test\nJapan R&D, wafer fabrication\nUnited States R&D, wafer fabrication, reticle manufacturing\nMalaysia Component assembly and test, module assembly and test\nChina Component assembly and test, module assembly and test\nWe believe that our existing facilities are suitable and adequate for our present purposes. We generally utilize all of our manufacturing capacity; however, a portion of our facilities were underutilized for 2023 due to industry conditions. See Part II - Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview - Industry Conditions for information regarding our current underutilization.\nTo support expected memory demand in the second half of the decade, we will need to add new DRAM wafer capacity. Following the enactment of the CHIPS Act in 2022, we announced plans to invest in two leading-edge memory manufacturing fabs in the United States, contingent on CHIPS Act support through grants and investment tax credits. As part of this plan, in September 2022, we broke ground on a leading-edge memory manufacturing fab in Boise, Idaho. Construction of the fab began in October 2023 with DRAM production targeted to start in calendar 2025 and first output in early calendar 2026. In addition, in October 2022, we announced plans to build a second leading-edge DRAM manufacturing fab in Clay, New York. We expect construction to begin in calendar 2024, with production anticipated to ramp in the latter half of the decade. We expect these new fabs to fulfill our requirements for additional wafer capacity starting in the second half of the decade and beyond, in line with industry demand trends. On August 21, 2023 we announced that two of our subsidiaries had each submitted full applications on August 18, 2023 for federal funding in the form of grants under the CHIPS Act for both of these projects.\nWe are also advancing our global back-end assembly and test network in order to support our product portfolio and extend our ability to deliver on global customer demand in the future. We intend to make investments at our backend facility in Xian, China, including a new building to provide space to add more product capability, to allow us over time to serve more of the demand from our customers in China from the Xian facility. We also intend to build a new assembly and test facility in Gujarat, India to address demand in the latter half of this decade.\nWe do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, other than goodwill. For a breakout of the carrying value of our long-lived assets by geographic area see Part II - Item 8.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFor a discussion of legal proceedings, see Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Contingencies and Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSEC regulations require disclosure of certain proceedings related to environmental matters unless we reasonably believe that the related monetary sanctions, if any, will be less than a specified threshold. We use a threshold of $1 million for this purpose. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nPART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nMarket Information\nOur common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the trading symbol MU.\nHolders of Record\nAs of September 29, 2023, there were approximately 1,719 shareholders of record of our common stock. A substantially greater number of holders of our common stock are \"street name\" or beneficial holders, whose shares are held of record by banks, brokers, and other financial institutions.\n41 | 2023 10-K\nDividends\nOn September 27, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.115 per share, payable in cash on October 25, 2023, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 10, 2023.\nWe currently expect quarterly dividends to continue in future periods and aim to grow our dividend payments over time. However, the declaration and payment of any future cash dividends are at the discretion and subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors' decisions regarding the amount and payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions, debt service obligations, contractual restrictions, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to pay a dividend in any future period.\nEquity Compensation Plan Information\nThe information required by this item is incorporated by reference from the information to be included in our 2023 Proxy Statement under the section entitled Equity Compensation Plan Information, which will be filed with the SEC within 120 days after August 31, 2023.\nIssuer Purchase of Equity Securities\nCommon Stock Repurchase Authorization\nIn 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to $10 billion of our outstanding common stock through open-market purchases, block trades, privately-negotiated transactions, derivative transactions, and/or pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date, does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, and is subject to market conditions and our ongoing determination of the best use of available cash. During the quarter ended August 31, 2023, we did not repurchase any common stock under the authorization and as of August 31, 2023, $3.11 billion of the authorization remained available for the repurchase of our common stock.\nShares of common stock withheld as payment of withholding taxes and exercise prices in connection with the vesting or exercise of equity awards are also treated as common stock repurchases. Those withheld shares of common stock are not required to be disclosed under Item 703 of Regulation S-K and accordingly are excluded from this Item 5.\nPerformance Graph\nThe following graph illustrates a five-year comparison of cumulative total returns for our common stock, the S&P 500 Composite Index, and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) from August 31, 2018, through August 31, 2023. We operate on a 52 or 53-week fiscal year which ends on the Thursday closest to August 31. Accordingly, the last day of our fiscal year varies. For consistent presentation and comparison to the industry indices shown herein, we have calculated our stock performance graph assuming an August 31 year end.\nNote: Management cautions that the stock price performance information shown in the graph above may not be indicative of current stock price levels or future stock price performance.\nThe performance graph above assumes $100 was invested on August 31, 2018 in common stock of Micron Technology, Inc., the S&P 500 Composite Index, and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX).

[RESERVED]\n43 | 2023 10-K ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended August 31, 2023. All period references are to our fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated. Our fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period ending on the Thursday closest to August 31. Fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 each contained 52 weeks. All tabular dollar amounts are in millions, except per share amounts.\nOverview\nFor an overview of our business, see Part I - Item 1. Business - Overview.\nIndustry Conditions\nThe memory and storage industry environment deteriorated sharply in the fourth quarter of 2022 and throughout 2023 due to weak demand in many end markets combined with global and macroeconomic challenges and lower demand resulting from customer actions to reduce inventory levels. This led to significant reductions in average selling prices for both DRAM and NAND and bit shipments for DRAM, resulting in declines in revenue across all our business segments and nearly all our end markets. Due to the challenging pricing environment, we recognized charges of $1.83 billion in 2023 to write down inventories to their estimated net realizable value. Ongoing demand growth, customer inventory normalization, and industry-wide supply discipline have set the stage for increased revenue, and improved pricing and profitability throughout fiscal 2024. As a result, pricing trends have started to improve and there were no write downs of inventories to net realizable value in the fourth quarter of 2023. However, further write-downs of inventories in future quarters could occur if pricing expectations deteriorate. Given the challenging pricing environment, elevated levels of inventories for suppliers and customers, and significant supply-demand mismatch, we expect industry profitability will remain challenged into 2024.\nAs a result of these conditions and increases in our inventory levels, we have reduced capital expenditures and also significantly reduced wafer starts in 2023 for both DRAM and NAND. We expect wafer starts will remain significantly below peak capacity levels for the foreseeable future as we remain focused on managing down our inventories and controlling our supply. We recognized period costs from fabrication facility underutilization of $382 million in 2023 due to wafer start reductions. We estimate that we will recognize approximately $200 million of period costs from underutilization due to wafer start reductions in the first quarter of 2024. We have also taken significant steps to reduce our costs and operating expenses. These actions include the 2023 Restructure Plan discussed below and additional reductions in external spending, including implementing productivity programs across the business, suspension of our 2023 bonus company-wide, reductions in select product programs, lower discretionary spending, and cuts to 2023 executive salaries across the company.\nImpact of China Cyberspace Administration Decision\nOn March 31, 2023, Chinas Cyberspace Administration (the CAC) notified us that it was conducting a cybersecurity review of our products sold in China. On May 21, 2023, we received notice that the CAC had concluded its review and decided that our products presented a cybersecurity risk. As such, the CAC determined that critical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products. There is no list of the companies that have been designated as critical information infrastructure operators published by the Chinese government or otherwise available to us. Therefore, the full impact of the CAC decision on our business remains uncertain.\nThe CAC decision has impacted our business, particularly in the domestic data center and networking markets in China. In addition, although demand for DRAM and NAND is improving as customer inventory levels continue to normalize and secular growth drivers remain intact, the CAC decision continues to impact our revenue opportunity in China. This significant headwind is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery. We are working to mitigate this impact over time and expect quarter-to-quarter revenue variability. Our revenue with companies headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong, including direct sales as well as indirect sales through distributors, is approximately a quarter of our worldwide revenue and remains our principal exposure to the CAC decision. Although the impact of the CAC decision remains uncertain, we believe that approximately half of that China-headquartered customer revenue, which equates to a low-double-digit percentage of our worldwide revenue, is at risk of being impacted. Despite the near-term impact to our demand as a result of the CAC decision, our long-term goal is to retain our worldwide DRAM and NAND market share.\n2023 Restructure Plan\nWe initiated a restructure plan in response to challenging industry conditions (the 2023 Restructure Plan). Under the plan, we expect our headcount reduction to approach 15% by the end of calendar 2023, through a combination of voluntary attrition and personnel reductions. In connection with the plan, we incurred restructure charges of $171 million in 2023 primarily related to employee severance costs. The 2023 Restructure Plan was substantially completed in 2023. As a result of the 2023 Restructure Plan, we expect to realize cost savings of approximately $130 million per quarter (approximately 60% in cost of goods sold, 30% in R&D, and 10% in SG&A) subsequent to 2023. Further information on restructure activities can be found in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Restructure and Asset Impairments.\nLehi, Utah Fab and 3D XPoint\nIn 2021, we updated our portfolio strategy to further strengthen our focus on memory and storage innovations for the data center market. In connection therewith, we determined that there was insufficient market validation to justify the ongoing investments required to commercialize 3D XPoint at scale. Accordingly, we ceased development of 3D XPoint technology and engaged in discussions for the sale of our facility located in Lehi, Utah that was dedicated to 3D XPoint production. As a result, we classified the property, plant, and equipment as held for sale in 2021, ceased depreciating the assets, and recognized a $435 million restructure and asset impairment charge and a $104 million tax benefit.\nWe closed the sale of our Lehi facility to TI in 2022 for $893 million and disposed of $918 million of net assets, consisting primarily of property, plant, and equipment, resulting in a $23 million loss, net of selling expenses and other adjustments.\n45 | 2023 10-K\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results\nFor the year ended 2023 2022 2021\nRevenue $ 15,540 100 % $ 30,758 100 % $ 27,705 100 %\nCost of goods sold 16,956 109 % 16,860 55 % 17,282 62 %\nGross margin\n(1,416) (9) % 13,898 45 % 10,423 38 %\nResearch and development 3,114 20 % 3,116 10 % 2,663 10 %\nSelling, general, and administrative 920 6 % 1,066 3 % 894 3 %\nRestructure and asset impairments 171 1 % 48 - % 488 2 %\nOther operating (income) expense, net\n124 1 % (34) - % 95 - %\nOperating income (loss) (5,745) (37) % 9,702 32 % 6,283 23 %\nInterest income (expense), net 80 1 % (93) - % (146) (1) %\nOther non-operating income (expense), net\n7 - % (38) - % 81 - %\nIncome tax (provision) benefit\n(177) (1) % (888) (3) % (394) (1) %\nEquity in net income (loss) of equity method investees\n2 - % 4 - % 37 - %\nNet income (loss) $ (5,833) (38) % $ 8,687 28 % $ 5,861 21 %\nTotal Revenue: Total revenue for 2023 was adversely impacted by the factors described in the section titled Industry Conditions above. Total revenue for 2023 decreased 49% as compared to 2022 primarily due to decreases in sales of both DRAM and NAND products.\nSales of DRAM products decreased 51% primarily due to a high-40s percent range decline in average selling prices and decreases in bit shipments in the high-single-digit percent range.\nSales of NAND products decreased 46% primarily due to a low-50s percent range decline in average selling prices partially offset by increases in bit shipments in the high-single-digit percent range.\nTotal revenue for 2022 increased 11% as compared to 2021 primarily due to increases in sales of both DRAM and NAND products.\nSales of DRAM products increased 12% primarily due to increases in bit shipments of slightly over 10%.\nSales of NAND products increased 11% primarily due to a high-single-digit percent increase in bit shipments and a low-single-digit percent increase in average selling prices.\nConsolidated Gross Margin: Our consolidated gross margin has been adversely impacted by the factors described in the section titled Industry Conditions above. Our consolidated gross margin percentage decreased to negative 9% for 2023 from 45% for 2022 primarily due to declines in average selling prices for both DRAM and NAND and charges to write down inventories (as detailed in Inventory NRV write-downs below), and $382 million of facility underutilization costs in 2023.\nInventory NRV write-downs: Our consolidated gross margin was impacted by charges to write down inventories to their estimated net realizable value as a result of declines in average selling prices for both DRAM and NAND. As charges to write down inventories are recorded in advance of when inventories are sold, costs of goods sold in subsequent periods are lower than they otherwise would be. The impact of inventory NRV write-downs for each period reflects (1) inventory write-downs in that period, offset by (2) lower costs in that period on the sale of inventory written down in prior periods. The impacts of inventory NRV write-downs are summarized below:\nFor the year ended 2023 2022 2021\nProvision to write down inventory to NRV\n$ (1,831) $ - $ -\nLower costs from sale of inventory written down in prior periods\n844 - -\n$ (987) $ - $ -\nOur consolidated gross margin percentage increased to 45% for 2022 from 38% for 2021, as a result of improvements in margins for both DRAM and NAND products, primarily due to reductions in manufacturing costs. Manufacturing cost reductions were driven by strong execution in ramping our 1\u03b1 DRAM and 176-layer NAND technology nodes. For 2021, our gross margins included the impact of underutilization costs at MTU of $335 million. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Lehi, Utah Fab and 3D XPoint. Also, effective as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2021, we changed our method of inventory costing from average cost to first-in, first-out (FIFO). Concurrently, as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2021, we modified our inventory cost absorption processes used to estimate inventory values, which affects the timing of when costs are recognized. These changes resulted in a one-time increase to cost of goods sold of approximately $293 million in 2021.\nRevenue by Business Unit\nFor the year ended 2023 2022 2021\nCNBU $ 5,710 37 % $ 13,693 45 % $ 12,280 44 %\nMBU 3,630 23 % 7,260 24 % 7,203 26 %\nEBU 3,637 23 % 5,235 17 % 4,209 15 %\nSBU 2,553 16 % 4,553 15 % 3,973 14 %\nAll Other 10 - % 17 - % 40 - %\n$ 15,540 $ 30,758 $ 27,705\nPercentages of total revenue may not total 100% due to rounding.\nChanges in revenue for each business unit for 2023 as compared to 2022 were as follows:\nCNBU revenue decreased 58% primarily due to declines in average selling prices for DRAM and decreases in bit shipments.\nMBU revenue decreased 50% primarily due to declines in average selling prices for both DRAM and NAND and decreases in NAND bit shipments.\nEBU revenue decreased 31% primarily due to declines in average selling prices for both DRAM and NAND and decreases in bit shipments.\nSBU revenue decreased 44% primarily due to declines in average selling prices for NAND partially offset by increases in bit shipments.\nChanges in revenue for each business unit for 2022 as compared to 2021 were as follows:\nCNBU revenue increased 12% primarily due to increases in bit shipments to cloud, enterprise, and networking markets.\nMBU revenue was relatively unchanged as both DRAM and NAND revenue was relatively flat.\nEBU revenue increased 24% primarily due to strong demand growth in industrial and automotive markets.\nSBU revenue increased 15% primarily due to higher average selling prices and increases in shipments of SSD products.\n47 | 2023 10-K\nOperating Income (Loss) by Business Unit\nFor the year ended 2023 2022 2021\nCNBU $ (585) (10) % $ 5,844 43 % $ 4,295 35 %\nMBU (1,750) (48) % 2,160 30 % 2,173 30 %\nEBU 382 11 % 1,752 33 % 1,006 24 %\nSBU (1,887) (74) % 513 11 % 173 4 %\nAll Other 8 80 % 12 71 % 20 50 %\n$ (3,832) $ 10,281 $ 7,667\nPercentages reflect operating income (loss) as a percentage of revenue for each business unit.\nChanges in operating income or loss for each business unit for 2023 as compared to 2022 were as follows:\nCNBU operating income (loss) deteriorated primarily due to declines in average selling prices and lower bit shipments.\nMBU operating income (loss) deteriorated primarily due to declines in average selling prices and lower NAND bit shipments.\nEBU operating income decreased primarily due to declines in average selling prices and lower bit shipments.\nSBU operating income (loss) deteriorated primarily due to declines in average selling prices.\nChanges in operating income or loss for each business unit for 2022 as compared to 2021 were as follows:\nCNBU operating income increased primarily due to higher bit shipments and manufacturing cost reductions.\nMBU operating income was relatively unchanged as slight increases in gross margins were offset by higher operating expenses.\nEBU operating income increased primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions from an increasing mix of leading-edge bits, higher bit shipments, and improved DRAM pricing in industrial and consumer markets, partially offset by higher R&D expenses.\nSBU operating income increased primarily due to improved product mix driving increases in average selling prices, increases in SSD shipments, and manufacturing cost reductions, partially offset by higher R&D expenses.\nOperating Expenses and Other\nResearch and Development: R&D expenses vary primarily with the number of development and pre-qualification wafers processed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, and personnel costs. Because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products, we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing. Development of a product is deemed complete when it is qualified through internal reviews and tests for performance and reliability. R&D expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification.\nR&D expenses for 2023 were relatively unchanged as compared to 2022 as decreases in employee compensation were offset by higher depreciation expense. R&D expenses for 2022 increased 17% as compared to 2021 primarily due to higher employee compensation from increases in headcount, higher volumes of development and prequalification wafers, and higher depreciation expense.\nSelling, General, and Administrative: SG&A expenses for 2023 were 14% lower as compared to 2022 primarily due to decreases in employee compensation, legal fees, advertising, and professional services. SG&A expenses for 2022 were 19% higher as compared to 2021 primarily due to increases in employee compensation, professional services, and legal fees.\nRestructure and Asset Impairments: For a discussion of restructure and asset impairments, see the Overview sections above titled 2023 Restructure Plan and Lehi, Utah Fab and 3D XPoint.\nInterest Income (Expense), Net: Interest income (expense) improved for 2023 as compared to 2022 primarily as a result of increases in interest income due to higher interest rates on our cash and investments, partially offset by increases in interest expense due to higher debt balances and interest rates. Interest income (expense) improved for 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to an increase of $59 million in interest income as a result of increases in interest rates on our cash and investments.\nIncome Taxes: Our income tax (provision) benefit consisted of the following:\nFor the year ended 2023 2022 2021\nIncome (loss) before taxes $ (5,658) $ 9,571 $ 6,218\nIncome tax (provision) benefit (177) (888) (394)\nEffective tax rate (3.1) % 9.3 % 6.3 %\nThe change in our effective tax rate for 2023 as compared to 2022 was primarily due to a pre-tax loss in 2023. Despite a consolidated pre-tax loss on a worldwide basis, we have taxes payable in certain geographies due to minimum taxable income reportable in those geographies. Our effective tax rate increased in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to the geographic mix of our earnings and a valuation allowance recorded against our Idaho deferred tax assets of $189 million, partially offset by tax impacts of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe operate in a number of jurisdictions outside the United States, including Singapore, where we have tax incentive arrangements. These incentives expire, in whole or in part, at various dates through 2034 and are conditional, in part, upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds. As a result of a loss before taxes and geographical mix of income, the benefit from tax incentive arrangements was not material for 2023. The effect of tax incentive arrangements reduced our tax provision by $1.12 billion (benefiting our diluted earnings per share by $1.00) for 2022 and by $758 million ($0.66 per diluted share) for 2021.\nBeginning in 2024, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 imposes a 15% book minimum tax on corporations with three-year average annual adjusted financial statement income exceeding $1 billion. The impact of this tax will depend on our facts in each year, anticipated guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and other developing global tax legislation.\nVarious tax reforms are being considered in multiple jurisdictions that, if enacted, contain provisions that could materially impact our tax expense. We continue to monitor the potential impact of these various tax reform proposals to our overall global effective tax rate and financial statements.\nOther: Further information can be found in the following notes contained in Item 8.

Cash generated from operations is highly dependent on selling prices for our products, which can vary significantly from period to period. Cash and marketable investments totaled $10.44 billion as of August 31, 2023, and $10.98 billion as of September 1, 2022. Our cash and investments consist primarily of bank deposits, money market funds, and liquid investment-grade, fixed-income securities, which are diversified among industries and individual issuers. To mitigate credit risk, we invest through high-credit-quality financial institutions and by policy generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting the amount of investments with any single obligor. As of August 31, 2023, $2.45 billion of our cash and marketable investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries.\nWe continuously evaluate alternatives for efficiently funding our capital expenditures and ongoing operations. We expect, from time to time, to engage in a variety of financing transactions for such purposes, including the issuance of securities. As of August 31, 2023, $2.50 billion was available to draw under our Revolving Credit Facility. On March 27, 2023, we entered into amendments to the Multi-Tranche Term Loan Agreement and the agreements governing the Revolving Credit Facility and the 2024 Term Loan A to revise the leverage ratio covenant in each such agreement, as further described in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Debt. Funding of certain significant capital projects is also dependent on the receipt of government incentives, which are subject to conditions and may not be obtained.\nTo develop new product and process technology, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies, facilities and equipment, and R&D. We estimate capital expenditures in 2024 for property, plant, and equipment, net of partner contributions, to be slightly above $7 billion. Actual amounts for 2024 will vary depending on market conditions. As of August 31, 2023, we had purchase obligations of approximately $915 million for the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment, of which approximately $812 million is expected to be paid within one year. For a description of other contractual obligations, such as leases, debt, and commitments, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Leases, - Debt, and - Commitments.\nTo support expected memory demand in the second half of the decade, we will need to add new DRAM wafer capacity. Following the enactment of the CHIPS Act in 2022, we announced plans to invest in two leading-edge memory manufacturing fabs in the United States, contingent on CHIPS Act support through grants and investment tax credits. As part of this plan, in September 2022, we broke ground on a leading-edge memory manufacturing fab in Boise, Idaho. Construction of the fab began in October 2023 with DRAM production targeted to start in calendar 2025 and first output in early calendar 2026. In addition, in October 2022, we announced plans to build a second leading-edge DRAM manufacturing fab in Clay, New York. We expect construction to begin in calendar 2024, with production anticipated to ramp in the latter half of the decade. We expect these new fabs to fulfill our requirements for additional wafer capacity starting in the second half of the decade and beyond, in line with industry demand trends. On August 21, 2023 we announced that two of our subsidiaries had each submitted full applications on August 18, 2023 for federal funding in the form of grants under the CHIPS Act for both of these projects.\nWe are also advancing our global back-end assembly and test network in order to support our product portfolio and extend our ability to deliver on global customer demand in the future. We intend to make investments at our backend facility in Xian, China, including a new building to provide space to add more product capability, to allow us over time to serve more of the demand from our customers in China from the Xian facility. We also intend to build a new assembly and test facility in Gujarat, India to address demand in the latter half of this decade.\nOur Board of Directors has authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to $10 billion of our outstanding common stock through open-market purchases, block trades, privately-negotiated transactions, derivative transactions, and/or pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date, does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, and is subject to market conditions and our ongoing determination of the best use of available cash. Through August 31, 2023, we had repurchased an aggregate of $6.89 billion of the authorized amount. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Equity.\nOn September 27, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.115 per share, payable in cash on October 25, 2023, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 10, 2023. The declaration and payment of any future cash dividends are at the discretion and subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors' decisions regarding the amount and payment of dividends will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions, debt service obligations, contractual restrictions, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.\nWe expect that our cash and investments, cash flows from operations, and available financing will be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\nCash Flows\nFor the year ended 2023 2022 2021\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 1,559 $ 15,181 $ 12,468\nNet cash provided by (used for) investing activities (6,191) (11,585) (10,589)\nNet cash provided by (used for) financing activities 4,983 (2,980) (1,781)\nEffect of changes in currency exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (34) (106) 41\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 317 $ 510 $ 139\nOperating Activities: Cash provided by operating activities reflects net income (loss) adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation expense, amortization of intangible assets, inventory write-downs, asset impairments, and stock-based compensation, and the effects of changes in operating assets and liabilities. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities for 2023 as compared to 2022 was primarily due to a net loss in the current year adjusted for non-cash items and the effect of an increase in inventories and a decline in accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by a decrease in receivables.\nThe increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2022 as compared to 2021 was primarily due to higher net income adjusted for non-cash items and the effect of lower receivables, partially offset by an increase in inventories.\nInvesting Activities: For 2023, net cash used for investing activities consisted primarily of $7.68 billion of expenditures for property, plant, and equipment; contributions of $710 million received from partners to offset capital expenditures; and $868 million of net inflows from maturities, sales, and purchases of available-for-sale securities.\nFor 2022, net cash used for investing activities consisted primarily of $12.07 billion of expenditures for property, plant, and equipment; contributions of $115 million received from partners to offset capital expenditures; $888 million of net inflows from the sale of the Lehi, Utah fab; and $155 million of net outflows from purchases, sales, and maturities of available-for-sale securities.\nFor 2021, net cash used for investing activities consisted primarily of $10.03 billion of expenditures for property, plant, and equipment, partially offset by contributions of $502 million received from partners to offset capital expenditures, and $1.06 billion of net outflows from purchases, sales, and maturities of available-for-sale securities.\nFinancing Activities: For 2023, net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of $3.20 billion of proceeds from our 2025, 2026, and 2027 Term Loan A borrowings, $1.27 billion from the issuance of the 2029 B Notes, $896 million from the issuance of the 2033 B Notes, $749 million from the issuance of the 2033 A Notes, and $599 million from the issuance of the 2028 Notes. Cash used for financing activities included $761 million for repayments of debt, $504 million for payments of dividends to shareholders, $425 million for the acquisition of 8.6 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase authorization, and $138 million of payments on equipment purchase contracts.\n51 | 2023 10-K\nFor 2022, net cash used for financing activities included $2.43 billion for the acquisition of 35.4 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase authorization, $2.03 billion of repayments of debt primarily to redeem the 2023 Notes and 2024 Notes, $461 million of cash payments of dividends to shareholders, and $141 million of payments on equipment purchase contracts. Cash used for financing activities was partially offset by aggregate proceeds of $2.00 billion from the issuance of the unsecured 2032 Green Bonds, 2041 Notes, and 2051 Notes.\nFor 2021, net cash used for financing activities consisted primarily of $1.20 billion for the acquisition of 15.6 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase authorization, $295 million of payments on equipment purchase contracts, $185 million of cash payments to settle conversions of our 2032D Notes, and $147 million of repayments of finance leases and other debt. In addition, we received proceeds of $1.19 billion under an unsecured 2024 Term Loan A and used the proceeds to repay the $1.19 billion Extinguished 2024 Term Loan A.\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Debt.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted events, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions and involve a significant level of uncertainty. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Our management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.\nContingencies: We are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Significant judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of a loss, if any, from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In accounting for the resolution of contingencies, significant judgment may be necessary to estimate amounts pertaining to periods prior to the resolution that are charged to operations in the period of resolution and amounts related to future periods.\nGoodwill: We test goodwill for impairment in our fourth quarter each year, or more frequently if indicators of an impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit with goodwill is less than its carrying value. For reporting units for which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value, goodwill is considered not impaired, and we are not required to perform the goodwill impairment test. Qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the fair value of the reporting unit. For reporting units for which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value, goodwill is tested for impairment by determining the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment loss up to the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value. We recognized a charge of $101 million in 2023 to impair all of the goodwill assigned to our SBU reporting unit based on our quantitative assessment for impairment in the current year. The quantitative assessment indicated that the fair value for all of our other reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value.\nDetermining when to test for impairment, the reporting units, the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, and the fair value of the reporting unit requires significant judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates, forecasted manufacturing costs, and other expenses and are developed as part of our long-range planning process. The same estimates are used in business planning, forecasting, and capital budgeting as part of our long-term manufacturing capacity analysis. These estimates and assumptions are used to calculate projected future cash flows for the reporting unit, which are discounted using a risk-adjusted rate to estimate a fair value. The discount rate requires determination of appropriate market comparables. We base fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. We assess the reasonableness of our methodology, forecasts, and assumptions by comparing the aggregate calculated fair value for our reporting units to our market capitalization.\nIncome taxes: We are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world. These estimates involve significant judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex. Resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of the applicable year. We are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income. Our income tax provision or benefit is dependent, in part, on our ability to forecast future taxable income in Japan, Malaysia, the United States, Taiwan, and other jurisdictions. Such forecasts are inherently difficult and involve significant judgments including, among others, projecting future average selling prices and sales volumes, manufacturing and overhead costs, levels of capital spending, and other factors that significantly impact our analyses of the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized.\nInventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. Cost includes depreciation, labor, material, and overhead costs, including product and process technology costs. Determining net realizable value of finished goods and work in process inventories involves significant judgments, including projecting future average selling prices, future sales volumes, and future cost per part. To project average selling prices and sales volumes, we review recent sales volumes, existing customer orders, current contract prices, industry analyses of supply and demand, and general economic trends. To project cost per part, we review trends with historical results and consider known changes in our cost structure as applicable. Actual selling prices may vary significantly from projected prices due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory and storage markets. When these analyses reflect estimated net realizable values below our manufacturing costs, we record a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when inventories are actually sold. As a result, the timing of when product costs are charged to costs of goods sold can vary significantly. Differences in future average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of finished goods and work in process inventories and accordingly the amount of write-down recorded. For example, a 5% decrease in future average selling prices would have changed the estimated net realizable value of our finished goods and work in process inventories by approximately $600 million as of August 31, 2023.\nU.S. GAAP provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to net realizable values. The amount of any inventory write-down can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories. We review the major characteristics of product type and markets in determining the unit of account for which we perform the lower of cost or net realizable value analysis and categorize all inventories (including DRAM, NAND, and other memory) as a single group.\nProperty, plant, and equipment: We periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment based on technology node transitions, capital spending, and equipment re-use rates. We also review the carrying value of property, plant, and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and/or disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets. The estimate of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require significant judgment by us, including, but not limited to, future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets, future selling prices for our products, and future production and sales volumes.\n53 | 2023 10-K\nRevenue recognition: Revenue is primarily recognized at a point in time when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods. Contracts with our customers are generally short-term in duration at fixed, negotiated prices with payment generally due shortly after delivery. We estimate a liability for returns using the expected value method based on historical returns. In addition, we generally offer price protection to our distributors, which is a form of variable consideration that decreases the transaction price. We use the expected value method, based on historical price adjustments and current pricing trends, to estimate the amount of revenue recognized from sales to distributors. Differences between the estimated and actual amounts are recognized as adjustments to revenue.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nNo material items.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nNo material items. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk related to our indebtedness and our investment portfolio. As of August 31, 2023 and September 1, 2022, we had fixed-rate debt with an aggregate carrying value of $7.52 billion and $4.03 billion, respectively, and as a result, the fair value of our debt fluctuates with changes in market interest rates. We estimate that, as of August 31, 2023 and September 1, 2022, a hypothetical 1% decrease in market interest rates would increase the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by approximately $475 million and $275 million, respectively.\nInterest rate risk related to our investment portfolio is managed by primarily investing in shorter term securities. We estimate that, as of August 31, 2023 and September 1, 2022, a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our portfolio by approximately $20 million and $30 million, respectively. Such impact would only be realized if investments were sold prior to maturity.\nAs of August 31, 2023 and September 1, 2022, we had floating-rate debt, including fixed-rate debt that is swapped to floating-rate debt, with an aggregate principal amount of $4.63 billion and $2.09 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 1% increase in the interest rates of this floating-rate debt would result in an increase in annual interest expense of $46 million and $21 million as of August 31, 2023 and September 1, 2022, respectively.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nThe information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the currency exchange rates in Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nThe functional currency for all of our operations is the U.S. dollar. The substantial majority of our sales are transacted in the U.S. dollar; however, significant amounts of our operating expenses and capital expenditures, and certain assets and liabilities, are incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the Chinese yuan, euro, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Malaysian ringgit, New Taiwan dollar, and Singapore dollar. We have established currency risk management programs for our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies to hedge against fluctuations in the fair value and volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates. We generally utilize currency forward contracts in these hedging programs, which reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nBased on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, we estimate that a hypothetical 10% adverse change in exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar would result in losses of approximately $129 million as of August 31, 2023 and $186 million as of September 1, 2022. We hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates by utilizing a rolling hedge strategy for our primary currency exposures with currency forward contracts that generally mature within three months. The effectiveness of our hedges is dependent, among other factors, upon our ability to accurately measure exposures on a timely basis. To hedge the exposure of changes in cash flows from changes in currency exchange rates for certain capital expenditures and manufacturing costs, we may utilize currency forward contracts that generally mature within two years.

With a relentless focus on our customers, technology leadership, and manufacturing and operational excellence, Micron delivers a rich portfolio of high-performance DRAM, NAND, and NOR memory and storage products through our Micron\u00ae and Crucial\u00ae brands. Every day, the innovations that our people create fuel the data economy, enabling advances in artificial intelligence and 5G applications that unleash opportunities - from the data center to the intelligent edge and across the client and mobile user experience.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Micron Technology, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to current period presentation. See Inventories below for changes to our significant accounting policies, and the Inventories note for additional information.\nOur fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period ending on the Thursday closest to August 31. Fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 each contained 52 weeks. All period references are to our fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated.\nDerivative and Hedging Instruments\nWe use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from (1) our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and (2) forecasted cash flows for certain capital expenditures and manufacturing costs. We also use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to changes in commodity prices for manufacturing supplies and to minimize certain exposures to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt that result from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. Derivative instruments are measured at their fair values and recognized as either assets or liabilities.\nThe accounting for changes in the fair value of derivative instruments is based on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments that are not designated for hedge accounting, gains or losses from changes in fair values are recognized in other non-operating income (expense) and cash flows are classified as investing activities in the statement of cash flows. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains or losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same line items and in the same periods in which the underlying transactions affect earnings. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, time value is excluded from the assessment of effectiveness and the gains and losses attributable to time value are recognized in earnings through an amortization approach. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair values of the derivative instruments and the offsetting changes in the fair values of the underlying hedged items are both recognized in earnings. Cash flows from derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges or fair value hedges are classified in the same category as the items being hedged.\nWe enter into master netting arrangements with our counterparties to mitigate credit risk in derivative hedge transactions. These master netting arrangements allow us and our counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each other. Derivative assets and liabilities that can be net settled with each counterparty have been presented in our consolidated balance sheet on a net basis.\nFinancial Instruments\nCash equivalents include highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities to us of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash. Other investments with remaining maturities of less than one year are included in short-term investments. Investments with remaining maturities greater than one year are included in long-term marketable investments. The carrying value of investment securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.\nFunctional Currency\nThe U.S. dollar is the functional currency for us and all of our consolidated subsidiaries.\nGoodwill\nWe perform an annual impairment assessment for goodwill in our fourth quarter each year.\nGovernment Incentives\nWe receive incentives from governmental entities related to capital expenditures, expenses, and other activities. Our government incentives may require that we meet or maintain specified spending levels and other operational metrics and may be subject to reimbursement if such conditions are not met or maintained. Government incentives are recorded in the financial statements in accordance with their purpose: as a reduction of asset costs or a reduction of expenses. Incentives related to the acquisition or construction of fixed assets are recognized as a reduction in the carrying amounts of the related assets and reduce depreciation expense over the useful lives of the assets. Incentives related to specific operating activities are offset against the related expense in the period the expense is incurred. Government incentives received prior to being earned are recognized in current or noncurrent deferred income or restricted cash, whereas government incentives earned prior to being received are recognized in current or noncurrent receivables. Cash received from government incentives related to operating expenses is included as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows, whereas cash received from incentives related to the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment is included as an investing activity.\nInventories\nEffective as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2021, we changed the method of inventory costing from average cost to FIFO. The difference between average cost and FIFO was not material to any previously reported financial statements. Therefore, we have recognized the cumulative effect of the change as a reduction of inventories and a charge to cost of goods sold of $133 million as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2021.\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined on a FIFO basis. Cost includes depreciation, labor, material, and overhead costs, including product and process technology costs. Determining net realizable value of finished goods and work in process inventories requires projecting future average selling prices, sales volumes, and costs per part. When net realizable value is below cost, we record a charge to cost of goods sold to write down inventories to their estimated net realizable value in advance of when inventories are actually sold. We review the major characteristics of product type and markets in determining the unit of account for which we perform the lower of cost or net realizable value analysis and categorize all inventories (including DRAM, NAND, and other memory) as a single group.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at the inception of the arrangement and evaluate whether the lease is an operating lease or a finance lease at the commencement date. We recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for operating and finance leases with terms greater than 12 months. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an asset for the lease term, while lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments. We do not separate lease and non-lease components for real-estate and gas plant leases. Sublease income is included within lease expense.\n63 | 2023 10-K\nProduct and Process Technology\nCosts incurred to (1) acquire product and process technology, (2) patent technology, and (3) maintain patent technology, are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging up to 12.5 years. We capitalize a portion of costs incurred to patent technology based on historical data of patents issued as a percent of patents we file. Product and process technology costs are amortized over the shorter of (1) the estimated useful life of the technology, (2) the patent term, or (3) the term of the technology agreement. Fully-amortized assets are removed from product and process technology and accumulated amortization.\nProduct Warranty\nWe generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with applicable specifications existing at the time of delivery. Under our standard terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of, or a credit with respect to, amounts paid for such items. Under certain circumstances, we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our standard terms and conditions. Our warranty obligations are not material.\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment\nProperty, plant, and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of generally 10 to 30 years for buildings, 7 years for production equipment, up to 7 years for other equipment, and 3 to 5 years for software. Assets held for sale are carried at the lower of estimated fair value or carrying value and are included in current assets. When property, plant, or equipment is retired or otherwise disposed, the net book value is removed and we recognize any gain or loss in results of operations.\nWe capitalize interest on borrowings during the period of time we carry out the activities necessary to bring assets to the condition of their intended use and location. Capitalized interest becomes part of the cost of assets.\nResearch and Development\nCosts related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are charged to R&D expense as incurred. Development of a product is deemed complete when it is qualified through reviews and tests for performance and reliability. Subsequent to product qualification, product costs are included in cost of goods sold. Amounts from cost-sharing arrangements are reflected as a reduction of R&D expense.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is primarily recognized at a point in time when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods. Contracts with our customers are generally short-term in duration at fixed, negotiated prices with payment generally due shortly after delivery. We estimate a liability for returns using the expected value method based on historical returns. In addition, we generally offer price protection to our distributors, which is a form of variable consideration that decreases the transaction price. We use the expected value method, based on historical price adjustments and current pricing trends, to estimate the amount of revenue recognized from sales to distributors. Differences between the estimated and actual amounts are recognized as adjustments to revenue.\nStock-based Compensation\nStock-based compensation is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and recognized as expense under the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period. We account for forfeitures as they occur. We issue new shares upon the exercise of stock options, conversion of share units, or issuance of shares under our ESPP.\nTreasury Stock\nTreasury stock is carried at cost. When we retire our treasury stock, any excess of the repurchase price paid over par value is allocated between additional capital and retained earnings.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted events, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and judgments may differ under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Actual results could differ from estimates.\nLehi, Utah Fab and 3D XPoint\nIn 2021, we updated our portfolio strategy to further strengthen our focus on memory and storage innovations for the data center market. In connection therewith, we determined that there was insufficient market validation to justify the ongoing investments required to commercialize 3D XPoint at scale. Accordingly, we ceased development of 3D XPoint technology and engaged in discussions for the sale of our facility located in Lehi, Utah that was dedicated to 3D XPoint production. As a result, we classified the property, plant, and equipment as held for sale in 2021, ceased depreciating the assets, and recognized a $435 million restructure and asset impairment charge and a $104 million tax benefit.\nWe closed the sale of our Lehi facility to TI in 2022 for $893 million and disposed of $918 million of net assets, consisting primarily of property, plant, and equipment, resulting in a $23 million loss, net of selling expenses and other adjustments.\nVariable Interest Entities\nA number of special purpose entities (the \"Lease SPEs\") were created by a third-party to facilitate equipment lease financing transactions between us and financial institutions that fund the lease financing transactions (\"Financing Entities\"). Neither we nor the Financing Entities have an equity interest in the Lease SPEs. The Lease SPEs are variable interest entities because their equity is not sufficient to permit them to finance their activities without additional support from the Financing Entities and because the third-party equity holder lacks characteristics of a controlling financial interest. By design, the arrangements with the Lease SPEs are merely financing vehicles and we do not bear any significant risks from variable interests with the Lease SPEs. We have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities of the Lease SPEs that most significantly impact their economic performance and we do not consolidate the Lease SPEs.\n65 | 2023 10-K\nCash and Investments\nAll of our short-term investments and long-term marketable investments were classified as available-for-sale as of the dates noted below. Cash and equivalents and the fair values of our available-for-sale investments, which approximated amortized costs, were as follows:\nAs of August 31, 2023 As of September 1, 2022\nCash and Equivalents Short-term Investments Long-term Marketable Investments(1)\nTotal Fair Value Cash and Equivalents Short-term Investments Long-term Marketable Investments(1)\nTotal Fair Value\nCash $ 5,771 $ - $ - $ 5,771 $ 6,055 $ - $ - $ 6,055\nLevel 1(2)\nMoney market funds 1,629 - - 1,629 1,196 - - 1,196\nLevel 2(3)\nCertificates of deposit 1,172 25 - 1,197 976 50 - 1,026\nCorporate bonds - 737 437 1,174 - 759 995 1,754\nAsset-backed securities - 15 387 402 - 20 608 628\nGovernment securities 5 131 20 156 2 155 44 201\nCommercial paper - 109 - 109 33 85 - 118\n8,577 $ 1,017 $ 844 $ 10,438 8,262 $ 1,069 $ 1,647 $ 10,978\nRestricted cash(4)\n79 77\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 8,656 $ 8,339\n(1)The maturities of long-term marketable investments primarily range from one to five years, except for asset-backed securities which are not due at a single maturity date.\n(2)The fair value of Level 1 securities is measured based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.\n(3)The fair value of Level 2 securities is measured using information obtained from pricing services, which obtain quoted market prices for similar instruments, non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data, or various other methodologies, to determine the appropriate value at the measurement date. We perform supplemental analysis to validate information obtained from these pricing services. No adjustments were made to the fair values indicated by such pricing information as of August 31, 2023 or September 1, 2022.\n(4)Restricted cash is included in other current assets and other noncurrent assets and primarily relates to certain government incentives received prior to being earned and for which restrictions lapse upon achieving certain performance conditions or which will be returned if performance conditions are not met.\nGross realized gains and losses from sales of available-for-sale securities were not significant for any period presented.\nNon-marketable Equity Investments\nIn addition to the amounts included in the table above, we had $218 million and $222 million of non-marketable equity investments without a readily determinable fair value that were included in other noncurrent assets as of August 31, 2023 and September 1, 2022, respectively. For non-marketable investments, we recognized in other non-operating income (expense) a net loss of $7 million for 2023 and net gains of $36 million for 2022 and $70 million for 2021. Our non-marketable equity investments are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis and classified as Level 3.\nReceivables\nAs of August 31,\n2023 September 1,\nTrade receivables $ 2,048 $ 4,765\nIncome and other taxes 194 251\nOther 201 114\n$ 2,443 $ 5,130\nInventories\nAs of August 31,\n2023 September 1,\nFinished goods $ 1,616 $ 1,028\nWork in process 6,111 4,830\nRaw materials and supplies 660 805\n$ 8,387 $ 6,663\nIn 2023, we recorded charges of $1.83 billion to cost of goods sold to write down the carrying value of work in process and finished goods inventories to their estimated net realizable value.\nEffective as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2021, we changed our method of inventory costing from average cost to FIFO. This change in accounting principle is preferable because in an environment with continuously changing production costs FIFO more closely matches the actual cost of goods sold with the revenues from sales of those specific units, better represents the actual cost of inventories remaining on hand at any period-end, and improves comparability with our semiconductor industry peers. The change to FIFO was not material to any prior periods, nor was the cumulative effect of $133 million material to the second quarter of 2021. As such, prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted, and the cumulative effect was reported as an increase to cost of goods sold for the second quarter of 2021 of $133 million, with an offsetting reduction to beginning inventories. This charge resulted in a corresponding reduction to operating income (loss), a $128 million reduction to net income (loss), and an $0.11 reduction to diluted earnings per share for both the second quarter and the year ended 2021.\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment\nAs of August 31,\n2023 September 1,\nLand $ 283 $ 280\nBuildings 17,967 16,676\nEquipment(1)\n65,555 61,354\nConstruction in progress(2)\n2,464 1,897\nSoftware 1,316 1,124\n87,585 81,331\nAccumulated depreciation (49,657) (42,782)\n$ 37,928 $ 38,549\n(1)Includes costs related to equipment not placed into service of $2.91 billion as of August 31, 2023 and $3.35 billion as of September 1, 2022.\n(2)Includes building-related construction, tool installation, and software costs for assets not placed into service.\nDepreciation expense was $7.67 billion, $7.03 billion, and $6.13 billion for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Interest capitalized as part of the cost of property, plant, and equipment was $208 million, $77 million, and $66 million for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\n67 | 2023 10-K\nIntangible Assets\nAs of August 31, 2023 As of September 1, 2022\nGross\nAmount Accumulated\nAmortization Net Carrying Amount Gross\nAmount Accumulated\nAmortization Net Carrying Amount\nProduct and process technology $ 613 $ (209) $ 404 $ 742 $ (321) $ 421\nIn 2023, 2022, and 2021, we capitalized $87 million, $158 million, and $106 million, respectively, for product and process technology with weighted-average useful lives of 9 years. Amortization expense was $86 million, $85 million, and $82 million for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Expected amortization expense is $75 million for 2024, $51 million for 2025, $47 million for 2026, $43 million for 2027, and $42 million for 2028.\nGoodwill\nAs of August 31,\n2023 September 1,\nGoodwill $ 1,150 $ 1,228\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we recognized a charge of $101 million included in other operating income (loss) to impair all of the goodwill assigned to our SBU reporting unit based on a quantitative assessment for impairment. We evaluated the fair value of our reporting units for the assessment based on an income approach, which uses a discounted cash flow methodology. The impairment of SBU goodwill reflects lower forecasted cash flows for SBU as a result of adverse conditions in the storage industry environment due to weak demand in many end markets combined with global and macroeconomic challenges and lower demand resulting from customer actions to reduce elevated inventory levels. These conditions led to significant reductions in SBUs average selling prices and bit shipments, driving declines in revenue and cash flows. The quantitative assessment for impairment indicated that the fair value for all of our other reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value.\nAs of August 31, 2023, CNBU, MBU, and EBU had goodwill of $855 million, $198 million, and $97 million, respectively. As of September 1, 2022, CNBU, MBU, SBU, and EBU had goodwill of $832 million, $198 million, $101 million, and $97 million, respectively. The Company added $23 million of goodwill to CNBU from an acquisition in the third quarter of 2023.\nLeases\nWe have finance and operating leases through which we obtain the right to use facilities, land, and equipment that support our business operations. Our finance leases consist primarily of (i) gas and other supply agreements that are deemed to contain embedded leases and (ii) equipment leases. Our operating leases consist primarily of offices, laboratories, other facilities, and land. Certain of our operating leases include one or more options to extend the lease term for periods from one year to 10 years for real estate and one year to 99 years for land.\nCertain supply or service agreements require us to exercise significant judgment to determine whether the agreement contains a lease. Our assessment includes determining whether we or the supplier control the assets used to fulfill the agreements by identifying whether we or the supplier have the right to change the type, quantity, timing, or location of the output of the assets. Our gas supply arrangements generally are deemed to contain a lease because we have the right to substantially all of the output of the assets used to produce the supply and we have the right to change the quantity and timing of the output of those assets. In determining the lease term, we assess whether we are reasonably certain to exercise any options to renew or terminate a lease or to purchase the right-of-use asset. Measuring the present value of the initial lease liability requires judgment to determine the discount rate, which we base on interest rates for borrowings with similar terms and collateral issued by entities with credit ratings similar to ours.\nThe components of lease cost are presented below:\nFor the year ended 2023 2022 2021\nFinance lease cost\nAmortization of right-of-use asset $ 105 $ 99 $ 69\nInterest on lease liability 24 24 20\nOperating lease cost(1)\n137 125 108\n$ 266 $ 248 $ 197\n(1)Operating lease cost includes short-term and variable lease expenses, which were not material for the periods presented.\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:\nFor the year ended 2023 2022 2021\nCash flows used for operating activities\nFinance leases\n$ 24 $ 23 $ 21\nOperating leases\n139 110 106\nCash flows used for financing activities - Finance leases 109 103 85\nNoncash acquisitions of right-of-use assets\nFinance leases 508 309 395\nOperating leases\n57 197 27\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows:\nAs of August 31,\n2023 September 1,\nFinance lease right-of-use assets (included in property, plant, and equipment)\n$ 1,311 $ 904\nCurrent operating lease liabilities (included in accounts payable and accrued expenses) 66 60\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (in years)\nFinance leases\n9 12\nOperating leases\n11 12\nWeighted-average discount rate\nFinance leases\n3.86 % 2.65 %\nOperating leases\n3.21 % 2.90 %\nAs of August 31, 2023, maturities of lease liabilities by fiscal year were as follows:\nFor the year ending Finance Leases Operating Leases\n2024 $ 219 $ 62\n2025 200 77\n2026 190 76\n2027 185 76\n2028 178 74\n2029 and thereafter 506 453\nLess imputed interest (197) (149)\n$ 1,281 $ 669\n69 | 2023 10-K\nThe table above excludes obligations for leases that have been executed but have not yet commenced. As of August 31, 2023, excluded obligations consisted of $170 million of finance lease obligations over a weighted-average period of 12 years for gas supply arrangements deemed to contain embedded leases and equipment leases. We will recognize right-of-use assets and associated lease liabilities at the time such assets become available for our use.\nAccounts Payable and Accrued Expenses\nAs of August 31,\n2023 September 1,\nAccounts payable $ 1,725 $ 2,142\nProperty, plant, and equipment 1,419 2,170\nSalaries, wages, and benefits 367 877\nIncome and other taxes 67 420\nOther 380 481\n$ 3,958 $ 6,090\nDebt\nAs of August 31, 2023 As of September 1, 2022\nNet Carrying Amount Net Carrying Amount\nStated Rate Effective Rate Principal Current Long-Term Total Principal Current Long-Term Total\n2024 Term Loan A 6.146 % 6.18 % $ 588 $ - $ 587 $ 587 $ 1,188 $ - $ 1,187 $ 1,187\n2025 Term Loan A 6.681 % 6.82 % 1,052 - 1,050 1,050 - - - -\n2026 Term Loan A 6.806 % 6.94 % 971 49 921 970 - - - -\n2027 Term Loan A 6.931 % 7.07 % 1,123 57 1,063 1,120 - - - -\n2026 Notes\n4.975 % 5.07 % 500 - 499 499 500 - 498 498\n2027 Notes(1)\n4.185 % 4.27 % 900 - 798 798 900 - 806 806\n2028 Notes 5.375 % 5.52 % 600 - 596 596 - - - -\n2029 A Notes 5.327 % 5.40 % 700 - 697 697 700 - 697 697\n2029 B Notes 6.750 % 6.54 % 1,250 - 1,263 1,263 - - - -\n2030 Notes\n4.663 % 4.73 % 850 - 846 846 850 - 846 846\n2032 Green Bonds 2.703 % 2.77 % 1,000 - 995 995 1,000 - 994 994\n2033 A Notes 5.875 % 5.96 % 750 - 745 745 - - - -\n2033 B Notes 5.875 % 6.01 % 900 - 890 890 - - - -\n2041 Notes 3.366 % 3.41 % 500 - 497 497 500 - 496 496\n2051 Notes 3.477 % 3.52 % 500 - 496 496 500 - 496 496\nFinance lease obligations\nN/A 3.86 % 1,281 172 1,109 1,281 886 103 783 886\n$ 13,465 $ 278 $ 13,052 $ 13,330 $ 7,024 $ 103 $ 6,803 $ 6,906\n(1) In 2021, we entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps on the 2027 Notes with an aggregate $900 million notional amount equal to the principal amount of the 2027 Notes. The resulting variable interest paid is at a rate equal to SOFR plus approximately 3.33%. The fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges, and as a result, the carrying values of our 2027 Notes reflect adjustments in fair value.\nAs of August 31, 2023, all of our debt, other than finance lease obligations, were unsecured obligations that rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future unsecured indebtedness and were effectively subordinated to all future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. All our unsecured debt were obligations of our parent company, Micron, and were structurally subordinated to all liabilities of its subsidiaries, including trade payables. The terms of our indebtedness generally contain cross payment default and cross acceleration provisions. Microns guarantees of certain liabilities of its subsidiaries are unsecured obligations ranking equally in right of payment with all of Microns other existing and future unsecured indebtedness.\nDebt Activity\nThe table below presents the effects of debt financing and prepayment activities in 2023:\nTransaction Date Increase (Decrease) in Principal Increase (Decrease) in Carrying Value Increase (Decrease) in Cash\nIssuances\n2029 B Notes October 31, 2022 $ 750 $ 744 $ 744\n2025 Term Loan A November 3, 2022 927 925 925\n2026 Term Loan A November 3, 2022 746 745 745\n2027 Term Loan A November 3, 2022 927 924 924\n2025 Term Loan A January 5, 2023 125 125 125\n2026 Term Loan A January 5, 2023 250 249 249\n2027 Term Loan A January 5, 2023 225 225 225\n2029 B Notes February 9, 2023 500 520 520\n2033 A Notes February 9, 2023 750 745 745\n2028 Notes April 11, 2023 600 596 596\n2033 B Notes April 11, 2023 900 890 890\nPrepayments\n2024 Term Loan A April 13, 2023 (600) (600) (600)\n$ 6,100 $ 6,088 $ 6,088\nIn 2022, we issued $2.00 billion of senior unsecured notes and received cash of $1.99 billion. The approximate $1.00 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of the 2032 Green Bonds are being used to fund eligible sustainability-focused projects. The remaining proceeds, along with cash on hand, were used to repay $1.85 billion of principal amount of notes (carrying value of $1.85 billion) for $1.93 billion in cash. We recognized losses of $83 million in connection with these repayments.\nIn 2021, substantially all holders of our 2032D Notes converted their notes. We settled these conversions and all remaining 2032D Notes with $185 million in cash and 11.1 million shares of our stock, which approximated the carrying value of debt and equity for those notes.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nWe may redeem our 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes, 2028 Notes, 2029 A Notes, 2029 B Notes, 2030 Notes, 2032 Green Bonds, 2033 A Notes, 2033 B Notes, 2041 Notes, and 2051 Notes (the Senior Unsecured Notes), in whole or in part, at our option prior to their respective maturity dates at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed and (ii) the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest, in each case plus accrued interest. We may also redeem any series of our Senior Unsecured Notes, in whole or in part, at a price equal to par between one and six months prior to maturity in accordance with the respective terms of such series.\n71 | 2023 10-K\nEach series of Senior Unsecured Notes contains covenants that, among other things, limit, in certain circumstances, our ability and/or the ability of our restricted subsidiaries (which are generally domestic subsidiaries in which we own at least 80% of the voting stock and which own principal property, as defined in the indenture governing such series) to (1) create or incur certain liens; (2) enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions; and (3) consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer, or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets, to another entity. These covenants are subject to a number of limitations and exceptions. Additionally, if a change of control triggering event, as defined in the indentures governing our Senior Unsecured Notes, occurs with respect to a series of Senior Unsecured Notes, we will be required to offer to purchase such Senior Unsecured Notes at 101% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount plus accrued interest up to the purchase date.\n2032 Green Bonds: We plan to allocate an amount equal to the approximate $1.00 billion of net proceeds of our unsecured 2032 Green Bonds by November 1, 2023, to fund eligible sustainability-focused projects involving renewable energy, green buildings, energy efficiency, water management, waste abatement, and a circular economy.\nMulti-Tranche Term Loan A\nIn 2023, we entered into a term loan agreement consisting of three tranches (the Multi-Tranche Term Loan Agreement) and borrowed $3.20 billion in aggregate principal amount. The tranches mature on November 3, 2025 (2025 Term Loan A); November 3, 2026 (2026 Term Loan A); and November 3, 2027 (2027 Term Loan A).\nThe 2026 Term Loan A and 2027 Term Loan A each require equal quarterly installment payments in an amount equal to 1.25% of the original principal amount. The 2025 Term Loan A does not require quarterly installment payments. Borrowings under the Multi-Tranche Term Loan Agreement will generally bear interest at adjusted term SOFR plus an applicable interest rate margin ranging from 1.00% to 2.00%, varying by tranche and depending on our corporate credit ratings. Adjusted term SOFR for the Multi-Tranche Term Loan Agreement is the SOFR benchmark plus 0.10%.\nThe Multi-Tranche Term Loan Agreement requires us to maintain, on a consolidated basis, a leverage ratio of total indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the Multi-Tranche Term Loan Agreement and calculated as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, not to exceed 3.25 to 1.00. On March 27, 2023, we amended the Multi-Tranche Term Loan Agreement to provide that in lieu of the foregoing leverage ratio, during the fourth quarter of 2023 and each quarter of 2024, we will be required to maintain, on a consolidated basis, a net leverage ratio of total net indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the Multi-Tranche Term Loan Agreement and calculated as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, not to exceed 3.25 to 1.00. Alternatively, for up to three of such five quarters, we may elect to comply with a requirement of minimum liquidity, as defined in the Multi-Tranche Term Loan Agreement, of not less than $5.0 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we complied with the net leverage ratio. Each of the leverage ratio and net leverage ratio maximums, as applicable, is subject to a temporary four quarter increase in such ratio to 3.75 to 1.00 following certain material acquisitions.\nThe Multi-Tranche Term Loan Agreement contains other covenants that, among other things, limit, in certain circumstances, our ability and/or the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to (1) create or incur certain liens and enter into sale and lease-back transactions, (2) create, assume, incur, or guarantee certain additional secured indebtedness and unsecured indebtedness of our restricted subsidiaries, and (3) consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer, lease, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, to another entity. These covenants are subject to a number of limitations, exceptions, and qualifications. Our obligations under the Multi-Tranche Term Loan Agreement are unsecured.\n2024 Term Loan A\nOn April 13, 2023, we used a portion of the proceeds from our April 2023 issuance of senior unsecured notes to prepay $600 million principal amount of our 2024 Term Loan A.\nOn June 7, 2023, the 2024 Term Loan A agreement was amended, pursuant to its transition provisions, to replace LIBOR-based benchmark rates with SOFR-based benchmark rates effective July 1, 2023. Subsequent to this amendment, borrowings under the 2024 Term Loan Agreement generally bear interest at adjusted term SOFR plus an applicable interest rate margin ranging from 0.625% to 1.375% depending on our corporate credit ratings. Adjusted term SOFR for the 2024 Term Loan A is the SOFR benchmark plus a credit spread adjustment ranging from approximately 0.11% to 0.43% depending on the applicable interest period selected. Prior to July 1, 2023, the 2024 Term Loan A bore interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 0.625% to 1.375% based on our corporate credit ratings.\nThe 2024 Term Loan A agreement contains the same leverage ratio, as amended, and substantially the same other covenants as the Multi-Tranche Term Loan Agreement. Our obligations under the 2024 Term Loan A agreement are unsecured.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nAs of August 31, 2023, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and $2.50 billion was available to us. Under the Revolving Credit Facility, borrowings would generally bear interest at a rate equal to adjusted term SOFR plus 1.00% to 1.75%, depending on our corporate credit ratings. Adjusted term SOFR for the Revolving Credit Facility agreement is the SOFR benchmark plus a credit spread adjustment ranging from approximately 0.11% to 0.43% depending on the applicable interest period selected. Any amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility would mature in May 2026 and amounts borrowed may be prepaid without penalty.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility contains the same leverage ratio, as amended, and substantially the same other covenants as the Multi-Tranche Term Loan Agreement.\nMaturities of Notes Payable\nAs of August 31, 2023, maturities of notes payable by fiscal year were as follows:\n2024 $ 107\n2025 695\n2026 1,659\n2027 1,780\n2028 1,493\n2029 and thereafter 6,450\nUnamortized issuance costs, discounts, and premium, net (35)\nHedge accounting fair value adjustment (100)\n$ 12,049\nCommitments\nAs of August 31, 2023, we had noncancelable commitments with remaining contractual terms in excess of one year of approximately $6.7 billion for purchase obligations, of which approximately $1.2 billion will be due in 2024, $1.4 billion due in 2025, $1.0 billion due in 2026, $1.0 billion due in 2027, $700 million due in 2028, and $1.4 billion due in 2029 and thereafter. Purchase obligations primarily include payments for goods or services with either a fixed or minimum quantity and price, which includes payments for the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment. Payments for leases that have been executed but have not yet commenced are excluded.\nIn 2023, we entered into an 18-year power purchase agreement in Singapore to purchase up to 450 megawatts of power at predominantly variable prices. This contract is expected to supply the majority of our power consumption needs in Singapore with more favorable pricing than our previous supply arrangements.\n73 | 2023 10-K\nContingencies\nWe are currently a party to legal actions other than those described below arising from the normal course of business, none of which are expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nPatent Matters\nAs is typical in the semiconductor and other high-tech industries, from time to time, others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that our products or manufacturing processes infringe upon their intellectual property rights.\nOn March 19, 2018, Micron Semiconductor (Xian) Co., Ltd. (MXA) was served with a patent infringement complaint filed by Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co., Ltd. (Jinhua) in the Fuzhou Intermediate Peoples Court in Fujian Province, China (the Fuzhou Court). On April 3, 2018, Micron Semiconductor (Shanghai) Co. Ltd. (MSS) was served with the same complaint. The complaint alleges that MXA and MSS infringed one Chinese patent by manufacturing and selling certain Crucial DDR4 DRAM modules. The complaint seeks an order requiring MXA and MSS to destroy inventory of the accused products and equipment for manufacturing the accused products in China; to stop manufacturing, using, selling, and offering for sale the accused products in China; and to pay damages of 98 million Chinese yuan plus court fees incurred.\nOn March 21, 2018, MXA was served with a patent infringement complaint filed by United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) in the Fuzhou Court. On April 3, 2018, MSS was served with the same complaint. The complaint alleges that MXA and MSS infringed one Chinese patent by manufacturing and selling certain Crucial DDR4 DRAM modules. The complaint seeks an order requiring MXA and MSS to destroy inventory of the accused products and equipment for manufacturing the accused products in China; to stop manufacturing, using, selling, and offering for sale the accused products in China; and to pay damages of 90 million Chinese yuan plus court fees incurred. On November 26, 2021, pursuant to a settlement agreement between UMC and Micron, UMC filed an application to the Fuzhou Court to withdraw its complaints against MXA and MSS.\nOn April 3, 2018, MSS was served with another patent infringement complaint filed by Jinhua and an additional complaint filed by UMC in the Fuzhou Court. The additional complaints allege that MSS infringes two Chinese patents by manufacturing and selling certain Crucial MX300 SSDs. The complaint filed by UMC seeks an order requiring MSS to destroy inventory of the accused products and equipment for manufacturing the accused products in China; to stop manufacturing, using, selling, and offering for sale the accused products in China; and to pay damages of 90 million Chinese yuan plus court fees incurred. The complaint filed by Jinhua seeks an order requiring MSS to destroy inventory of the accused products and equipment for manufacturing the accused products in China; to stop manufacturing, using, selling, and offering for sale the accused products in China; and to pay damages of 98 million Chinese yuan plus court fees incurred. On November 26, 2021, pursuant to a settlement agreement between UMC and Micron, UMC filed an application to the Fuzhou Court to withdraw its complaint against MSS.\nOn July 5, 2018, MXA and MSS were notified that the Fuzhou Court granted a preliminary injunction against those entities that enjoins them from manufacturing, selling, or importing certain Crucial and Ballistix-branded DRAM modules and solid-state drives in China. We are complying with the ruling and have requested the Fuzhou Court to reconsider or stay its decision.\nOn April 28, 2021, Netlist, Inc. (Netlist) filed two patent infringement actions against Micron, Micron Semiconductor Products, Inc. (MSP), and Micron Technology Texas, LLC (MTEC) in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. The first complaint alleges that one U.S. patent is infringed by certain of our non-volatile dual in-line memory modules. The second complaint alleges that three U.S. patents are infringed by certain of our load-reduced dual in-line memory modules (LRDIMMs). Each complaint seeks injunctive relief, damages, attorneys fees, and costs. On March 31, 2022, Netlist filed a patent infringement complaint against Micron and Micron Semiconductor Germany, GmbH in Dusseldorf Regional Court alleging that two German patents are infringed by certain of our LRDIMMs. The complaint seeks damages, costs, and injunctive relief. On June 10, 2022, Netlist filed a patent infringement complaint against Micron, MSP, and MTEC in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (E.D. Tex.) alleging that six U.S. patents are infringed by certain of our memory modules and HBM products. On August 1, 2022, Netlist filed a second patent infringement complaint against the same defendants in E.D. Tex. alleging that one U.S. patent is infringed by certain of our LRDIMMs. On August 15, 2022, Netlist amended the second complaint to assert that two additional U.S. patents are infringed by certain of our LRDIMMs. The complaints in E.D. Tex. seek injunctive relief, damages, and attorneys fees.\nOn August 16, 2022, Sonrai Memory Ltd. filed a patent infringement action against Micron in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. The complaint alleges that two U.S. patents are infringed by certain SSD and NAND flash products. The complaint seeks damages, attorneys fees, and costs.\nOn January 23, 2023, Besang Inc. filed a patent infringement complaint against Micron in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges that one U.S. patent is infringed by certain of our 3D NAND and SSD products. The complaint seeks an injunction, damages, attorneys fees, and costs.\nAmong other things, the above lawsuits pertain to substantially all of our DRAM, NAND, and other memory and storage products we manufacture, which account for substantially all of our revenue.\nQimonda\nOn January 20, 2011, Dr. Michael Jaff\u00e9, administrator for Qimondas insolvency proceedings, filed suit against Micron and Micron Semiconductor B.V. (Micron B.V.), in the District Court of Munich, Civil Chamber. The complaint sought to void, under Section 133 of the German Insolvency Act, a share purchase agreement between Micron B.V. and Qimonda signed in fall 2008, pursuant to which Micron B.V. purchased substantially all of Qimondas shares of Inotera (the Inotera Shares), representing approximately 18% of Inoteras outstanding shares at that time, and sought an order requiring us to re-transfer those shares to the Qimonda estate. The complaint also sought, among other things, to recover damages for the alleged value of the joint venture relationship with Inotera and to terminate, under Sections 103 or 133 of the German Insolvency Code, a patent cross-license between us and Qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreement.\nFollowing a series of hearings with pleadings, arguments, and witnesses on behalf of the Qimonda estate, on March 13, 2014, the court issued judgments: (1) ordering Micron B.V. to pay approximately $1 million in respect of certain Inotera Shares sold in connection with the original share purchase; (2) ordering Micron B.V. to disclose certain information with respect to any Inotera Shares sold by it to third parties; (3) ordering Micron B.V. to disclose the benefits derived by it from ownership of the Inotera Shares, including in particular, any profits distributed on the Inotera Shares and all other benefits; (4) denying Qimondas claims against Micron for any damages relating to the joint venture relationship with Inotera; and (5) determining that Qimondas obligations under the patent cross-license agreement are canceled. In addition, the court issued interlocutory judgments ordering, among other things: (1) that Micron B.V. transfer to the Qimonda estate the Inotera Shares still owned by Micron B.V. and pay to the Qimonda estate compensation in an amount to be specified for any Inotera Shares sold to third parties; and (2) that Micron B.V. pay the Qimonda estate as compensation an amount to be specified for benefits derived by Micron B.V. from ownership of the Inotera Shares. The interlocutory judgments had no immediate, enforceable effect and Micron, accordingly, was able to continue to operate with full control of the Inotera Shares subject to further developments in the case. Micron and Micron B.V. appealed the judgments to the German Appeals Court, which thereafter appointed an independent expert to perform an evaluation of Dr. Jaff\u00e9s claims that the amount Micron paid for Qimonda was less than fair market value. On March 31, 2020, the expert presented an opinion to the Appeals Court concluding that the amount paid by Micron was within an acceptable range of fair value. On October 5, 2022, the Appeals Court ruled that the relevant issue to be addressed is whether Qimonda's creditors were prejudiced such that the original transaction should be voided.\n75 | 2023 10-K\nOn May 9, 2023, Micron and Dr. Jaff\u00e9 reached an agreement to dismiss the case in exchange for a one-time payment by Micron to the Qimonda estate and a waiver of each partys claims. The agreement was formally entered by the Appeals Court in July 2023 and the case was dismissed.\nAntitrust Matters\nSix cases have been filed against Micron alleging price fixing of DRAM products in the following Canadian courts on the dates indicated: Superior Court of Quebec (April 30, 2018 and May 3, 2018), the Federal Court of Canada (May 2, 2018), the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (May 15, 2018), and the Supreme Court of British Columbia (May 10, 2018). The plaintiffs in these cases are individuals seeking certification of class actions on behalf of direct and indirect purchasers of DRAM in Canada (or regions of Canada) between June 1, 2016 and February 1, 2018.\nOn May 15, 2018, the Chinese State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) notified Micron that it was investigating potential collusion and other anticompetitive conduct by DRAM suppliers in China. On May 31, 2018, SAMR made unannounced visits to our sales offices in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen to seek certain information as part of its investigation. We are cooperating with SAMR in its investigation.\nSecurities Matters\nOn February 9, 2021, a derivative complaint was filed by a shareholder against Sanjay Mehrotra and other current and former directors of Micron, allegedly on behalf of and for the benefit of Micron, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging violations of securities laws, breaches of fiduciary duties, and other violations of law involving allegedly false and misleading statements about Microns commitment to diversity and progress in diversifying its workforce, executive leadership, and Board of Directors. The complaint seeks damages, fees, interest, costs, and an order requiring Micron to take various actions to allegedly improve its corporate governance and internal procedures.\nOther Matters\nIn the normal course of business, we are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify another party. It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these types of agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, our payments under these types of agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nContingency Assessment\nWe are unable to predict the outcome of any of the matters noted above and cannot make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of possible losses. A determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering into a license agreement covering such intellectual property could result in significant liability and/or require us to make material changes to our products and/or manufacturing processes. Any of the foregoing, as well as the resolution of any other legal matter noted above, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nEquity\nCommon Stock Repurchases\nOur Board of Directors has authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to $10 billion of our outstanding common stock through open-market purchases, block trades, privately-negotiated transactions, derivative transactions, and/or pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date, does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, and is subject to market conditions and our ongoing determination of the best use of available cash. We repurchased 8.6 million shares of our common stock for $425 million in 2023 and 35.4 million shares for $2.43 billion in 2022. Through August 31, 2023, we had repurchased an aggregate of $6.89 billion under the authorization. Amounts repurchased are included in treasury stock.\nDividends\nIn each quarter of 2023, we declared and paid dividends of $126 million ($0.115 per share). On September 27, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.115 per share, payable in cash on October 25, 2023, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 10, 2023.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nChanges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component for the year ended August 31, 2023 were as follows:\nGains (Losses) on Derivative Instruments Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investments Pension Liability Adjustments Cumulative Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment Total\nAs of September 1, 2022 $ (538) $ (47) $ 25 $ - $ (560)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications\n19 18 17 (3) 51\nAmount reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n261 1 (2) - 260\nTax effects\n(46) (13) (4) - (63)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) 234 6 11 (3) 248\nAs of August 31, 2023 $ (304) $ (41) $ 36 $ (3) $ (312)\nFair Value Measurements\nThe estimated fair values and carrying values of our outstanding debt instruments were as follows:\nAs of August 31, 2023 As of September 1, 2022\nFair\nValue Carrying\nValue Fair\nValue Carrying\nValue\nNotes $ 11,549 $ 12,049 $ 5,472 $ 6,020\nThe fair values of our debt instruments were estimated based on Level 2 inputs, including the trading price of our notes when available, discounted cash flows, and interest rates based on similar debt issued by parties with credit ratings similar to ours.\n77 | 2023 10-K\nDerivative Instruments\nNotional or Contractual Amount Fair Value of\nAssets(1)\nLiabilities(2)\nAs of August 31, 2023\nDerivative instruments with hedge accounting designation\nCash flow currency hedges\n$ 3,873 $ 16 $ (180)\nCash flow commodity hedges 331 45 -\nFair value interest rate hedges 900 - (100)\nDerivative instruments without hedge accounting designation\nNon-designated currency hedges\n1,839 2 (17)\n$ 63 $ (297)\nAs of September 1, 2022\nDerivative instruments with hedge accounting designation\nCash flow currency hedges\n$ 5,427 $ - $ (330)\nCash flow commodity hedges 97 1 (6)\nFair value interest rate hedges 900 - (91)\nDerivative instruments without hedge accounting designation\nNon-designated currency hedges\n2,821 7 (13)\n$ 8 $ (440)\n(1)Included in receivables and other noncurrent assets.\n(2)Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities.\nDerivative Instruments with Hedge Accounting Designation\nCash Flow Hedges: We utilize forward and swap contracts that generally mature within two years designated as cash flow hedges to minimize our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates or commodity prices for certain capital expenditures and manufacturing costs. Forward and swap contracts are measured at fair value based on market-based observable inputs including market spot and forward rates, interest rates, and credit-risk spreads (Level 2). We recognized gains from cash flow hedges of $30 million for 2023, and losses of $735 million and $52 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We recognized losses related to amounts excluded from hedge effectiveness testing on our cash flow hedges of $101 million in 2023 in cost of goods sold through an amortization approach. The amounts recognized in 2022 and 2021 were not significant. We reclassified losses of $261 million and $53 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively, and gains of $41 million in 2021, from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings, primarily to cost of goods sold. As of August 31, 2023, we expect to reclassify $177 million of pre-tax losses related to cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings in the next 12 months.\nFair Value Hedges: We utilize fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges to minimize certain exposures to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt that result from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. Interest rate swaps are measured at fair value based on market-based observable inputs including interest rates and credit-risk spreads (Level 2). The changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges and the offsetting changes in the underlying fair values of the hedged items are both recognized in earnings. When a derivative is no longer designated as a fair value hedge for any reason, including termination and maturity, the remaining unamortized difference between the carrying value of the hedged item at that time and the face value of the hedged item is amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item, or immediately if the hedged item has matured or been extinguished. We recognized interest expense of $96 million for changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps in 2022 and the impact to interest expense was not significant for 2023 or 2021. We also recognized offsetting reductions in interest expense of the same amounts related to the changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt for these periods.\nDerivative Instruments without Hedge Accounting Designation\nCurrency Derivatives: We generally utilize a rolling hedge strategy with currency forward contracts that mature within three months to hedge our exposures of monetary assets and liabilities from changes in currency exchange rates. At the end of each reporting period, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are remeasured into U.S. dollars and the associated outstanding forward contracts are marked to market. Currency forward contracts are valued at fair values based on the middle of bid and ask prices of dealers or exchange quotations (Level 2). Realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments without hedge accounting designation as well as the changes in the underlying monetary assets and liabilities from changes in currency exchange rates are included in other non-operating income (expense), net. The amounts recognized for derivative instruments without hedge accounting designation were not significant for the periods presented. We do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes.\nDerivative Counterparty Credit Risk and Master Netting Arrangements\nOur derivative instruments expose us to credit risk to the extent counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the contracts. Our maximum exposure to loss due to credit risk if counterparties fail completely to perform according to the terms of the contracts would generally equal the fair value of assets for these contracts as listed in the tables above. We seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions and by spreading risk across multiple financial institutions. As of August 31, 2023 and September 1, 2022, amounts netted under our master netting arrangements were not significant.\nEquity Plans\nAs of August 31, 2023, 95 million shares of our common stock were available for future awards under our equity plans, including 14 million shares approved for issuance under our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP).\nRestricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units (Restricted Stock Awards)\nAs of August 31, 2023, there were 29 million shares of Restricted Stock Awards outstanding, 26 million of which contained only service conditions. For service-based Restricted Stock Awards granted through October 2021, restrictions generally lapse in one-fourth or one-third increments during each year of employment after the grant date. For service-based Restricted Stock Awards granted beginning in November 2021, restrictions generally lapse on 25% or 33% of the units granted after the first year and on 6.25% or 8.33% each quarter thereafter over the remaining three or two years of employment. Restrictions generally lapse on Restricted Stock with performance or market conditions as conditions are met over a 3-year period. At the end of the performance period, the number of actual shares to be awarded will vary between 0% and 200% of target amounts, depending upon the achievement level. In 2022, our Board of Directors approved dividend equivalent rights for unvested restricted stock units awarded on or after October 13, 2021.\nRestricted Stock Awards activity for 2023 is summarized as follows:\nNumber of Shares Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share\nOutstanding as of September 1, 2022 23 $ 60.93\nGranted 17 55.99\nRestrictions lapsed (9) 58.23\nCanceled (2) 58.00\nOutstanding as of August 31, 2023 29 59.11\n79 | 2023 10-K\nFor the year ended 2023 2022 2021\nRestricted stock award shares granted 17 13 11\nWeighted-average grant-date fair value per share $ 55.99 $ 70.81 $ 53.58\nAggregate vesting-date fair value of shares vested\n$ 514 $ 498 $ 385\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)\nOur ESPP is offered to substantially all employees and permitted eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock through payroll deductions of up to 10% of their eligible compensation, subject to certain limitations prior to August 2021. Beginning in August 2021, employees are permitted to deduct up to 15% of their eligible compensation to purchase shares under the ESPP. The purchase price of the shares under the ESPP equals 85% of the lower of the fair market value of our common stock on either the first or last day of each six-month offering period. Compensation expense is calculated as of the beginning of the offering period as the fair value of the employees purchase rights utilizing the Black-Scholes option valuation model and is recognized over the offering period. Grant-date fair value and assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option valuation model were as follows:\nFor the year ended 2023 2022 2021\nWeighted-average grant-date fair value per share $ 17.06 $ 18.87 $ 20.71\nAverage expected life in years 0.5 0.5 0.5\nWeighted-average expected volatility (based on implied volatility) 37 % 43 % 41 %\nWeighted-average risk-free interest rate 5.1 % 2.0 % 0.1 %\nExpected dividend yield 0.7 % 0.6 % 0.3 %\nUnder the ESPP, employees purchased 5 million, 4 million, and 3 million shares of common stock in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, at a per share weighted average price of $51.93, $58.52, and $51.42, respectively.\nStock Options\nAs of August 31, 2023, stock options of 2 million shares were outstanding, all of which were fully exercisable. Stock options expire 8 years from the date of grant. We did not grant any stock options in 2023, 2022, or 2021. Stock options of 1 million shares were exercised in 2023. The total intrinsic value for options exercised was $30 million, $54 million, and $143 million in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nStock-based Compensation Expense\nFor the year ended 2023 2022 2021\nStock-based compensation expense by caption\nResearch and development $ 226 $ 175 $ 110\nCost of goods sold 201 193 186\nSelling, general, and administrative 137 133 99\nRestructure (7) (5) -\n$ 557 $ 496 $ 395\nStock-based compensation expense by type of award\nRestricted stock awards $ 488 $ 429 $ 333\nESPP 69 66 52\nStock options - 1 10\n$ 557 $ 496 $ 395\nIncome tax benefits related to the tax deductions for share-based awards are recognized only upon the settlement of the related share-based awards. Income tax benefits for share-based awards were $68 million, $77 million, and $83 million for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense of $88 million and $48 million was capitalized and remained in inventory as of August 31, 2023 and September 1, 2022, respectively. As of August 31, 2023, $1.26 billion of total unrecognized compensation costs for unvested awards, before the effect of any future forfeitures, was expected to be recognized through the fourth quarter of 2027, resulting in a weighted-average period of 1.3 years.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nWe have employee retirement plans at our U.S. and international sites. Details of significant plans are as follows:\nEmployee Savings Plan for U.S. Employees\nWe have a 401(k) retirement plan under which U.S. employees may contribute up to 75% of their eligible pay, subject to Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limits, to various savings alternatives, none of which include direct investment in our stock. We match in cash eligible contributions from employees up to 5% of the employees annual eligible earnings. Contribution expense for the 401(k) plan was $59 million, $66 million, and $77 million in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nRetirement Plans\nWe have pension plans available to employees at various foreign sites. As of August 31, 2023, the projected benefit obligations of our plans were $175 million and plan assets were $232 million. As of September 1, 2022, the projected benefit obligations of our plans were $186 million and plan assets were $221 million. Pension expense was not material for 2023, 2022, or 2021.\nGovernment Incentives\nWe receive incentives from governmental entities primarily in India, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, and the United States principally in the form of cash grants and tax credits. These incentives primarily relate to capital expenditures, have initial terms ranging from one year to 15 years, and may be subject to reimbursement if certain conditions are not met or maintained. The conditions attached to these incentives require us to incur expenditures related to the construction of new manufacturing facilities, the purchase and installation of specialized tools and equipment, R&D expenditures, and/or maintain certain levels of fixed asset investment or employee headcount during the incentive terms.\nThe line items on the balance sheet affected by government incentives were as follows:\nAs of August 31,\nReceivables $ 105\nOther noncurrent assets 179\nOther current liabilities 11\nNoncurrent unearned government incentives 727\nAs of August 31, 2023, we had aggregate commitments from various governmental entities of up to $2 billion to be received through 2033 (in addition to the receivables and other noncurrent assets in the table above), subject to achievement of certain performance conditions. We also receive a 25% investment tax credit on qualified investments in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing under the CHIPS Act. Subsequent to August 31, 2023, we finalized an incentive arrangement under which we will receive additional grants of up to $1.3 billion.\n81 | 2023 10-K\nGovernment incentives related to capital expenditures have reduced property, plant and equipment by $1.57 billion as of August 31, 2023, of which $584 million pertained to 2023 expenditures.\nIn 2023, operating income (loss) benefited by $318 million (approximately 93% in COGS and 7% in R&D) from government incentives recognized as a reduction of expense, primarily in the form of reduced depreciation expense.\nRevenue\nRevenue is primarily recognized at a point in time when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods. Substantially all contracts with our customers are short-term in duration at fixed, negotiated prices with payment generally due shortly after delivery. From time to time, we have contracts with initial terms that include performance obligations that extend beyond one year. As of August 31, 2023, our future performance obligations beyond one year were not significant.\nAs of August 31, 2023 and September 1, 2022, other current liabilities included $453 million and $1.26 billion, respectively, for estimates of consideration payable to customers including estimates for pricing adjustments and returns.\nIn 2023, we received an aggregate of $228 million from settlements of insurance claims involving a power disruption in 2022 and an operational disruption in 2017, of which $186 million was for business interruption and recognized in revenue.\nRevenue by Technology\nFor the year ended 2023 2022 2021\nDRAM $ 10,978 $ 22,386 $ 20,039\nNAND 4,206 7,811 7,007\nOther (primarily NOR)\n356 561 659\n$ 15,540 $ 30,758 $ 27,705\nSee Segment and Other Information for disclosure of disaggregated revenue by market segment.\nRestructure and Asset Impairments\nFor the year ended 2023 2022 2021\nEmployee severance $ 163 $ - $ 3\nAsset impairments and other asset-related costs 14 63 478\nOther (6) (15) 7\n$ 171 $ 48 $ 488\nIn 2023, we initiated the 2023 Restructure Plan in response to challenging industry conditions. Under the 2023 Restructure Plan, we expect our headcount reduction to approach 15% by the end of calendar 2023 through a combination of voluntary attrition and personnel reductions. In connection with the plan, we incurred restructure charges of $171 million in 2023, primarily related to employee severance costs. The plan was substantially completed in the third quarter of 2023. As of August 31, 2023, we had paid $167 million in 2023 in connection with the 2023 Restructure Plan and the remaining liability was $4 million.\nRestructure and asset impairments for 2022 and 2021 are primarily related to the sale of our Lehi, Utah facility.

These incentives expire, in whole or in part, at various dates through 2034 and are conditional, in part, upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds. As a result of a loss before taxes and geographic mix of income, the benefit from tax incentive arrangements was not material for 2023. These arrangements reduced our tax provision by $1.12 billion (benefiting our diluted earnings per share by $1.00) for 2022 and by $758 million ($0.66 per diluted share) for 2021.\nAs of August 31, 2023, certain non-U.S. subsidiaries had cumulative undistributed earnings of $4.28 billion that were deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. A provision has not been recognized to the extent that distributions from such subsidiaries are subject to additional foreign withholding or state income tax. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities related to investments in these foreign subsidiaries is not practicable.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes as well as carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the following:\nAs of August 31,\n2023 September 1,\nDeferred tax assets\nNet operating loss and tax credit carryforwards $ 1,112 $ 796\nAccrued salaries, wages, and benefits 39 157\nOperating lease liabilities 135 138\nInventories 52 77\nProperty, plant, and equipment - 44\nOther 75 142\nGross deferred tax assets 1,413 1,354\nLess valuation allowance (528) (471)\nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance 885 883\nDeferred tax liabilities\nRight-of-use assets (115) (126)\nProperty, plant, and equipment\n(31) -\nOther (100) (68)\nDeferred tax liabilities (246) (194)\nNet deferred tax assets $ 639 $ 689\nReported as\nDeferred tax assets $ 756 $ 702\nDeferred tax liabilities (included in other noncurrent liabilities) (117) (13)\nNet deferred tax assets $ 639 $ 689\nWe assess positive and negative evidence for each jurisdiction to determine whether it is more likely than not that existing deferred tax assets will be realized. As of August 31, 2023, and September 1, 2022, we had a valuation allowance of $528 million and $471 million, respectively, against our net deferred tax assets, primarily related to carryforwards in U.S. states and Malaysia. Changes in 2023 in the valuation allowance were due to adjustments based on management's assessment of the realizability of tax credits, allowances and net operating losses based on a level that is more likely than not to be realized.\nAs of August 31, 2023, our net operating loss carryforward amounts and expiration periods, as reported to tax authorities, were as follows:\nYear of Expiration Singapore\nMalaysia\nState\nJapan\nOther Total\n2024 - 2028 $ - $ - $ 47 $ 336 $ 25 $ 408\n2029 - 2033 - - 348 321 109 778\n2034 - 2038 - - 237 - - 237\n2039 - 2043 - - 183 - - 183\nIndefinite 1,688 1,025 60 - 202 2,975\n$ 1,688 $ 1,025 $ 875 $ 657 $ 336 $ 4,581\n85 | 2023 10-K\nAs of August 31, 2023, our federal and state tax credit carryforward amounts and expiration periods, as reported to tax authorities, were as follows:\nYear of Tax Credit Expiration U.S. Federal State Total\n2024 - 2028 $ - $ 51 $ 51\n2029 - 2033 - 120 120\n2034 - 2038 - 137 137\n2039 - 2043 306 5 311\nIndefinite - 131 131\n$ 306 $ 444 $ 750\nBelow is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of our unrecognized tax benefits:\nFor the year ended 2023 2022 2021\nBeginning unrecognized tax benefits $ 731 $ 660 $ 411\nIncreases related to tax positions from prior years 2 14 2\nIncreases related to prior year tax positions taken in current year\n27 - -\nIncreases related to tax positions taken in current year 17 80 260\nDecreases related to tax positions from prior years (33) (23) (13)\nEnding unrecognized tax benefits $ 744 $ 731 $ 660\nAs of August 31, 2023, gross unrecognized tax benefits were $744 million, which would have an impact of approximately $581 million on our effective tax rate in the future, if recognized. Amounts accrued for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were not significant for any period presented. The resolution of tax audits or expiration of statute of limitations could also reduce our unrecognized tax benefits. Although the timing of final resolution is uncertain, the estimated potential reduction in our unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months would not be significant.\nWe and our subsidiaries file income tax returns with the U.S. federal government, various U.S. states, and various foreign jurisdictions throughout the world. We regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters, including transfer pricing, and we continue to defend any and all such claims presented. Our U.S. federal and state tax returns remain open to examination for 2018 through 2023. We are currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service for our 2018 and 2019 tax years. In addition, tax returns that remain open to examination in Singapore, Taiwan and Japan range from the years 2014 to 2023. We believe that adequate amounts of taxes and related interest and penalties have been provided, and any adjustments as a result of examinations are not expected to materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nEarnings Per Share\nFor the year ended 2023 2022 2021\nNet income (loss) - Basic and Diluted $ (5,833) $ 8,687 $ 5,861\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding - Basic 1,093 1,112 1,120\nDilutive effect of equity plans and convertible notes\n- 10 21\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding - Diluted 1,093 1,122 1,141\nEarnings (loss) per share\nBasic $ (5.34) $ 7.81 $ 5.23\nDiluted (5.34) 7.75 5.14\nAntidilutive potential common shares excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share, that could dilute basic earnings per share in the future, were as follows at the end of the periods shown:\nFor the year ended 2023 2022 2021\nEquity plans 33 5 2\nSegment and Other Information\nSegment information reported herein is consistent with how it is reviewed and evaluated by our chief operating decision maker.

Other indirect operating income and expenses are generally allocated to segments based on their respective percentage of cost of goods sold or forecasted wafer production. We do not identify or report internally our assets (other than goodwill) or capital expenditures by segment, nor do we allocate gains and losses from equity method investments, interest, other non-operating income or expense items, or taxes to segments.\n87 | 2023 10-K\nFor the year ended 2023 2022 2021\nRevenue\nCNBU $ 5,710 $ 13,693 $ 12,280\nMBU 3,630 7,260 7,203\nEBU 3,637 5,235 4,209\nSBU 2,553 4,553 3,973\nAll Other 10 17 40\n$ 15,540 $ 30,758 $ 27,705\nOperating income (loss)\nCNBU $ (585) $ 5,844 $ 4,295\nMBU (1,750) 2,160 2,173\nEBU 382 1,752 1,006\nSBU (1,887) 513 173\nAll Other 8 12 20\n(3,832) 10,281 7,667\nUnallocated\nProvision to write down inventories to net realizable value (1,831) - -\nLower costs from sale of inventory written down in prior periods 844 - -\nStock-based compensation (564) (501) (395)\nInventory accounting policy change to FIFO - - (133)\nChange in inventory cost absorption - - (160)\n3D XPoint inventory write-down - - (49)\nRestructure and asset impairments (171) (48) (488)\nGoodwill impairment\n(101) - -\nLitigation settlement (68) - -\nPatent license charges - - (128)\nOther (22) (30) (31)\n(1,913) (579) (1,384)\nOperating income (loss)\n$ (5,745) $ 9,702 $ 6,283\nDepreciation and amortization expense included in operating income (loss) was as follows:\nFor the year ended 2023 2022 2021\nCNBU $ 2,512 $ 2,766 $ 2,497\nMBU 2,149 1,725 1,553\nEBU 1,324 1,280 1,028\nSBU 1,751 1,323 1,101\nAll Other 1 2 8\nUnallocated 19 20 27\n$ 7,756 $ 7,116 $ 6,214\nCertain Concentrations\nRevenue by market segment as an approximate percent of total revenue is presented in the table below:\nFor the year ended 2023 2022 2021\nAutomotive, industrial, and consumer 25 % 15 % 15 %\nMobile 25 % 25 % 25 %\nClient and graphics 15 % 20 % 20 %\nEnterprise and cloud server 15 % 20 % 20 %\nSSDs and other storage 15 % 15 % 15 %\nNo customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue in 2023. Revenue from Kingston Technology Company, Inc. was 12% of total revenue in 2022 and revenue from WPG Holdings Limited was 11% and 13% of total revenue in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Sales to Kingston were primarily included in our CNBU and SBU segments and sales to WPG were primarily included in our MBU, CNBU, and EBU segments.\nWe generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and production equipment; however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials and production equipment that meet our standards and, in some cases, materials or production equipment are provided by a single supplier.\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, fixed-rate debt securities, trade receivables, share repurchase, and derivative contracts. We invest through high-credit-quality financial institutions and, by policy, generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting investments with any single obligor and monitoring credit risk of bank counterparties on an ongoing basis. A concentration of credit risk may exist with respect to receivables of certain customers. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of customers worldwide and generally do not require collateral from our customers. Historically, we have not experienced material losses on receivables. A concentration of risk may also exist with respect to our foreign currency hedges as the number of counterparties to our hedges is limited and the notional amounts are relatively large. We seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions and through entering into master netting arrangements.\n89 | 2023 10-K\nGeographic Information\nRevenue based on the geographic location of our customers headquarters was as follows:\nFor the year ended 2023 2022 2021\nUnited States $ 7,805 $ 16,026 $ 12,155\nTaiwan 2,697 6,185 6,606\nMainland China (excluding Hong Kong) 2,181 3,311 2,456\nJapan 987 1,696 1,652\nOther Asia Pacific 752 1,223 1,420\nEurope\n682 505 573\nHong Kong 340 1,665 2,582\nOther 96 147 261\n$ 15,540 $ 30,758 $ 27,705\nLong-lived assets by geographic area consisted of property, plant, and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets and were as follows:\nAs of August 31,\n2023 September 1,\nTaiwan $ 12,926 $ 13,143\nSingapore 11,283 12,045\nJapan 7,323 7,113\nUnited States 5,196 5,155\nMalaysia 1,124 994\nChina 395 440\nOther 347 337\n$ 38,594 $ 39,227\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Micron Technology, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Micron Technology, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of August 31, 2023 and September 1, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income (loss), of changes in equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2023, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2023 appearing under Item 15 (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 31, 2023 and September 1, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in the Significant Accounting Policies and Inventories notes to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for inventory costing from the average cost inventory accounting method to the first-in, first-out inventory accounting method in 2021.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Companys management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n91 | 2023 10-K\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nNet Realizable Value of Finished Goods and Work in Process Inventories\nAs described in the Inventories note to the consolidated financial statements, as of August 31, 2023, the Company had net finished goods and work in process inventories totaling $7.7 billion. As disclosed by management, determining the net realizable value of the Company's finished goods and work in process inventories involves significant judgments, including projecting future average selling prices, future sales volumes, and future cost per part. The memory and storage industry environment deteriorated sharply in the fourth quarter of 2022 and throughout 2023 due to weak demand in many end markets combined with global and macroeconomic challenges and lower demand resulting from customer actions to reduce elevated inventory levels. This led to significant reductions in average selling prices for both DRAM and NAND, resulting in declines in revenue across all of the Companys business segments and nearly all end markets. The Company recorded charges of $1.83 billion to cost of goods sold to write down the carrying value of work in process and finished goods inventories to their estimated net realizable value.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the net realizable value of finished goods and work in process inventories is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in determining the net realizable value of finished goods and work in process inventories and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating managements significant assumptions related to future average selling prices and future cost per part.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to managements determination of the net realizable value of finished goods and work in process inventories, including controls over significant assumptions and data utilized. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management's process for determining the net realizable value of finished goods and work in process inventories; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of managements methodology; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in determining the net realizable value; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management's significant assumptions related to future average selling prices and future cost per part. Evaluating management's assumption related to future average selling prices for certain products involved evaluating whether the assumption used by management was reasonable considering (i) current and past results, including recent sales; (ii) the consistency with external market, industry data or current contract prices; (iii) a comparison of the prior year estimates to actual results in the current fiscal year; and (iv) whether the assumption was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Evaluating management's assumption related to future cost per part for certain products involved evaluating whether the assumption used by management was reasonable considering (i) current and past results; (ii) a comparison of the prior year estimates to actual results in the current fiscal year; and (iii) whether the assumption was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSan Jose, California\nOctober 6, 2023\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 1984.\n93 | 2023 10-K ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nAn evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that those disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of August 31, 2023. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2023 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K.
