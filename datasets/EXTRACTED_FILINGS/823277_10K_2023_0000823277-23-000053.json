    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nTHE COMPANY\nCHS Inc. (referred to herein as \"CHS,\" \"company,\" \"we,\" \"us\" or \"our\") is the nation's leading integrated agricultural cooperative, providing grain, food, agronomy and energy resources to businesses and consumers on a global basis. As a cooperative, we are owned by farmers and ranchers and member cooperatives (referred to herein as \"members\") across the United States. We also have preferred shareholders who own shares of our five series of preferred stock, all of which are listed and traded on the Global Select Market of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. We buy commodities from and provide products and services to individual agricultural producers, local cooperatives and other companies (including our members and other nonmember customers), both domestically and internationally. We provide a wide variety of products and services, ranging from initial agricultural inputs such as fuels, farm supplies, crop nutrients and crop protection products to agricultural outputs that include grain and oilseed, processed grain and oilseed, renewable fuels and food products. A portion of our operations are conducted through equity investments and joint ventures whose operating results are not fully consolidated with our results; rather, a proportionate share of the income or loss from those equity investments and joint ventures is included as a component of our net income using the equity method of accounting. For the year ended August 31, 2023, our total revenues were $45.6 billion and net income attributable to CHS was $1.9 billion.\nWe have aligned our segments based on an assessment of how our businesses operate and the products and services they sell. Our Energy segment derives its revenues through refining, wholesaling and retailing of petroleum products. Our Ag segment derives its revenues through origination and marketing of grain, including service activities conducted at export terminals; through wholesale agronomy sales of crop nutrient and crop protection products; from sales of soybean meal, refined soy oil and soyflour products; through the production and marketing of renewable fuels; and through retail sales of petroleum and agronomy products, processed sunflowers, feed and farm supplies. Our Ag segment also records equity income from our grain export joint venture and other investments. Our Nitrogen Production segment consists of our equity method investment in CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC (\"CF Nitrogen\"), and allocated expenses. Our other business operations, primarily our financing and hedging businesses, are included in Corporate and Other because of the nature of their products and services, as well as the relative amount of revenues from those businesses. In addition, our nonconsolidated food production and distribution joint venture, Ventura Foods, LLC (\"Ventura Foods\"), and our nonconsolidated wheat milling joint venture, Ardent Mills, LLC (\"Ardent Mills\"), are included in Corporate and Other.\nAs required under our bylaws and Minnesota cooperative law, our earnings from cooperative business are required to be allocated to our members and to a limited extent to nonmembers with which we have agreed to do business on a patronage basis based on the volume of business they do with us. We allocate these earnings to our patrons in the form of patronage refunds, which are also called patronage dividends, and which may be in cash, patrons' equities in the form of capital equity certificates or both. Patrons' equities may be redeemed over time solely at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Earnings derived from nonmembers, which are not treated as patronage, are taxed at federal and state statutory corporate rates and are retained by us as unallocated capital reserves. We also receive patronage refunds from the cooperatives in which we are a member, if those cooperatives have earnings to distribute and if we qualify for patronage refunds from them.\nOur origins date back to the early 1930s with the founding of our predecessor companies, Cenex, Inc., and Harvest States Cooperatives. CHS Inc. emerged as the result of the merger of those two entities in 1998 and is headquartered in Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota.\nOur internet address is www.chsinc.com. The information contained on our website is not part of, and is not incorporated into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other report we file with or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\").\nENERGY\nOverview\nWe are the nation's largest cooperative energy company based on revenues and identifiable assets, with operations that include petroleum refining and pipelines; supply, marketing and distribution of refined fuels (gasoline, diesel fuel and other energy products); blending, sale and distribution of lubricants; and wholesale supply of propane and other natural gas liquids. Our Energy segment processes crude oil into refined petroleum products at our refineries in Laurel, Montana, and McPherson, Kansas, and sells those products under the Cenex\u00ae brand to member cooperatives and other independent retailers through a network of nearly 1,500 sites, the majority of which are convenience stores marketing Cenex brand fuels and owned by our member cooperatives. For fiscal 2023, our Energy revenues, after elimination of intersegment revenues, were $10.1 billion and were primarily from gasoline, diesel fuel and propane.\nOperations\nLaurel refinery. Our Laurel, Montana, refinery processes medium- and high-sulfur crude oil into refined petroleum products that primarily include gasoline, diesel fuel, asphalt and petroleum coke. Our Laurel refinery sources approximately 96% of its crude oil supply from Canada, with the remaining balance obtained from domestic sources, and we have access to Canadian and northwest Montana crude oil through our wholly-owned Front Range Pipeline, LLC, and other common carrier pipelines. Our Laurel refinery also has access to Wyoming crude oil via common carrier pipelines from the south.\nOur Laurel refinery processes approximately 63,000 barrels of crude oil per day to produce refined products that consist of approximately 37% gasoline, 42% diesel fuel and other distillates, 12% asphalt, 6% petroleum coke and 3% other products. Refined fuels produced at our Laurel refinery are available via railcars and via the Yellowstone Pipeline to western Montana terminals and to Spokane, Washington; south via common carrier pipelines to Wyoming terminals and Denver, Colorado; and east via our wholly-owned Cenex Pipeline, LLC, to Glendive, Montana, and to Minot, Prosper and Fargo, North Dakota.\nMcPherson refinery. Our McPherson, Kansas, refinery processes approximately 63% low- and medium-sulfur crude oil and approximately 37% heavy-sulfur crude oil into gasoline, diesel fuel and other distillates, petroleum coke and other products. The refinery sources its crude oil through its own pipelines, as well as through joint venture and common carrier pipelines. Low- and medium-sulfur crude oil is sourced from Kansas, Colorado, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Texas, and heavy-sulfur crude oil is sourced from Canada and Wyoming.\nOur McPherson refinery processes approximately 114,000 barrels of crude oil per day to produce refined products that consist of approximately 50% gasoline, 43% diesel fuel and other distillates, 5% petroleum coke and 2% other products. These products are loaded into trucks at the McPherson refinery or shipped via common carrier pipelines to other markets.\nOther energy operations. We operate 11 propane terminals, four asphalt terminals, eight refined product terminals and three lubricants blending and packaging facilities. We also own and lease a fleet of liquid and pressure trailers and tractors, which transport refined fuels, propane, anhydrous ammonia and other products.\nProducts and Services\nOur Energy segment produces and sells (primarily wholesale) gasoline, diesel fuel, propane, asphalt, lubricants and other related products, and also provides transportation services. In addition to selling products refined at our Laurel and McPherson refineries, we purchase refined petroleum products from third parties as the need arises. For fiscal 2023, we obtained approximately 74% of the refined petroleum products we sold from our Laurel and McPherson refineries and approximately 26% from third parties. The percentage of refined petroleum products that we obtain from third parties is dependent on refinery production volumes and will vary from year to year primarily based on our planned major maintenance schedule.\nSales and Marketing: Customers\nWe market approximately 77% of our refined fuel products to members, with the balance sold to nonmembers. Sales are made wholesale to member cooperatives and through a network of independent retailers that operate convenience stores under the Cenex brand. We sold approximately 1.5 billion gallons of gasoline and approximately 1.7 billion gallons of diesel fuel in fiscal 2023. We also blend, package and wholesale auto and farm equipment lubricants to members and nonmembers. We are one of the nation's largest propane wholesalers based on revenues. Most of the propane sold in rural areas is for heating and agricultural use. Annual sales volumes of propane vary greatly depending on weather patterns and crop conditions.\nIndustry: Competition\nThe petroleum business is highly cyclical. Demand for crude oil and energy products is driven by the condition of local and worldwide economies, local and regional weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources, which can significantly affect the price of refined fuel products. Our Energy segment generally experiences higher volumes and revenues in certain operating areas, such as refined fuel products in the spring, summer and early fall when gasoline and diesel fuel usage by our agricultural customers is highest and is subject to domestic supply and demand forces. Other energy products, such as propane, generally experience higher volumes and revenues during the winter heating and crop-drying seasons. More fuel-efficient equipment, reduced crop tillage, depressed prices for crops, weather conditions and government programs that encourage idle acres may all reduce demand for our energy products.\nRegulation. Governmental regulations and policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, have a significant impact on our Energy segment. Our Energy segment's operations are subject to laws and related regulations and rules designed to protect the environment that are administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"), the U.S. Department of Transportation (\"DOT\"), the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and similar government agencies. These laws, regulations and rules govern, among other things, discharge of materials into the environment, including air and water; reporting storage of hazardous wastes and other hazardous materials; transportation, handling and disposal of wastes and other materials; labeling of pesticides and similar substances; and investigation and remediation of the release of hazardous materials. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations and rules could subject us to administrative penalties, injunctive relief, civil remedies and possible product recalls. Our hedging transactions and activities are subject to the rules and regulations of the exchanges we use and to governing bodies, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (\"CME\"), the New York Mercantile Exchange (\"NYMEX\") and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\"CFTC\").\nCompetition. The petroleum refining and wholesale fuels business is very competitive. Among our competitors are some of the world's largest integrated petroleum companies, which have their own crude oil supplies and distribution and marketing systems. We also compete with smaller domestic refiners and marketers in the midwestern and northwestern United States, with foreign refiners who import products into the United States and with producers and marketers in other industries supplying other forms of energy and fuels to consumers. Given the commodity nature of the end products, profitability in the industry depends largely on margins, as well as operating efficiency, product mix and costs of product distribution and transportation. The retail gasoline market is highly competitive, with competitors that are much larger than CHS and have greater brand recognition and distribution outlets throughout the country and world than we do. We also are experiencing increased competition from regional and unbranded retailers. Our owned and nonowned retail outlets are located primarily in the midwestern and northwestern United States.\nWe market refined fuel products in five principal geographic areas. The first area includes the Midwest and Northern Plains. Competition at the wholesale level in this area includes major oil companies, as well as independent refiners and wholesale brokers and/or suppliers. This area has a robust spot market and is influenced by the large refinery center along the Gulf Coast.\nTo the east of the Midwest and Northern Plains is another unique marketing area. This area centers near Chicago, Illinois, and includes Illinois, Indiana and eastern Wisconsin. In this area, we principally compete with the major oil companies, as well as independent refiners and wholesale brokers and/or suppliers.\nAnother market area includes Arkansas, Missouri and the northern part of Texas. Competition in this area includes the major oil companies and independent refiners. This area is principally supplied by the Gulf Coast refinery center and is also driven by a strong spot market that reacts quickly to changes in the international and national supply balance.\nAnother geographic area includes Colorado, Idaho, Montana, western North Dakota, western South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming. Competition at the wholesale level in this area includes the major oil companies and independent refiners.\nThe last area includes much of Oregon and Washington. We compete with the major oil companies in this area, which is known for volatile prices and an active spot market.\nAG\nOverview\nOur Ag segment includes global grain and processing, country operations and wholesale agronomy businesses. These businesses work together to facilitate the production, purchase, sale and eventual use of grain and other agricultural products within the United States, as well as internationally. In fiscal 2023, revenues in our Ag segment were $35.4 billion after elimination of intersegment revenues.\nOperations\nGlobal grain and processing. We are the nation's largest cooperative marketer of grain and oilseed based on grain sales. Our global grain marketing operations purchase grain directly from agricultural producers and elevator operators primarily in the midwestern and western United States and indirectly through our country operations business. Purchased grain is typically contracted for sale for future delivery at a specified location, and we are responsible for handling the grain and either arranging for or facilitating its transportation to that location. We own and operate export terminals, river terminals and elevators throughout the United States to handle and transport grain and grain products. We also maintain locations in Europe, the Middle East, the Pacific Rim and South America for marketing, merchandising and/or sourcing grains and crop nutrients. We primarily conduct our global grain marketing operations directly, but do conduct some of our operations through joint ventures, including TEMCO, LLC (\"TEMCO\"), a 50%-owned joint venture with Cargill, Incorporated (\"Cargill\"), that focuses on exports, primarily to Asia.\nOur processing business includes our oilseed processing and renewable fuels production businesses. Oilseed processing is conducted at facilities that crush approximately 135 million bushels of soybeans and canola on an annual basis, producing approximately 3.1 million short tons of meal and flour and 1.7 billion pounds of edible and inedible oil annually. We purchase oilseeds to be processed from members, other CHS businesses and third parties that have tightly integrated connections with our global grain marketing operations and country operations business. Our renewable fuels business produces 255 million gallons of fuel-grade ethanol, 69 million pounds of inedible corn oil and 638,000 tons of dried distillers grains with solubles (\"DDGS\") annually. Renewable fuels produced by our production plants are marketed by our global grain marketing business, along with more than 713 million gallons of ethanol and 4.9 million tons of DDGS annually under marketing agreements with ethanol production plants.\nCountry operations. Our country operations business operates 415 agri-operations locations through 27 business units dispersed throughout the midwestern and western United States. Most of these locations purchase grain from farmers and sell agronomy, energy, feed and seed products to those same producers and others, although not all locations provide every product and service. We also manufacture animal feed through nine owned plants and three limited liability companies.\nWholesale agronomy. Our wholesale agronomy business includes our wholesale crop nutrients and wholesale crop protection businesses. Our wholesale crop nutrients business delivers products directly to our customers and our country operations business from the manufacturer or through our 11 warehouse terminals and other nonowned storage facilities located throughout the United States. To supplement what is purchased domestically, our Galveston, Texas, deepwater port and terminal receives fertilizer by vessel from origins in Europe and Asia where significant volumes of urea are produced. The fertilizer is then shipped by rail to destinations within crop-producing regions of the United States. Our wholesale crop protection business operates out of our network of 27 warehouses from which we deliver products directly to our member cooperatives and independent retailers. We also operate a bulk chemical rail terminal in Brooten, Minnesota, where we handle and store bulk crop protection products for some of the crop protection industry's largest chemical manufacturers. This facility has more than 6 million gallons of chemical storage capacity.\nProducts and Services\nOur Ag segment provides member cooperatives and farmers with the inputs and services they need to produce grain and raise livestock. These include seed, crop nutrients, crop protection products, animal feed, animal health products, refined fuels and propane. We also buy and merchandise grain in both domestic and international markets. With a portion of the grain we purchase, we produce renewable fuels, including ethanol and DDGS. We also produce refined soy and canola oils, soybean meal, canola meal and soyflour at our processing facilities.\nSales and Marketing: Customers\nOur Ag segment provides products and services to a wide range of customers, primarily in the United States. These customers include member and nonmember producers, member cooperatives, elevators, grain dealers, grain processors and crop nutrient and crop protection retailers. We sell our edible soy and canola oils and soyflour to food companies and our inedible oils may be sold to energy companies. The soybean meal and canola meal we produce is sold to integrated livestock producers and feed mills. The ethanol and DDGS we produce are sold throughout the United States and to various international customers.\nIndustry: Competition\nMost of the business activities in our Ag segment are highly seasonal and, consequently, the operating results for our Ag segment will typically vary throughout the year. For example, our country operations business generally experiences higher volumes and revenues during the spring planting and fall harvest seasons and our agronomy business generally experiences higher volumes and revenues during the spring planting season. In addition, our Ag segment operations may be adversely affected by relative levels of supply and demand, both domestic and international, commodity price levels and transportation costs and conditions. Supply is affected by weather conditions, plant disease, insect damage, acreage planted, wars and civil unrest, and government regulations and policies. Demand may be affected by foreign governments and their programs, relationships of foreign countries with the United States, affluence of foreign countries, wars and civil unrest, currency exchange fluctuations and substitution of commodities. Demand may also be affected by changes in eating habits, population growth, per capita consumption of some products, federal and state policies and renewable fuels production levels.\nRegulation. Our Ag operations are subject to laws and related regulations and rules designed to protect the environment and that are administered by the EPA, the DOT and similar government agencies. These laws, regulations and rules govern, among other things, discharge of materials into the environment, including air and water; reporting storage of hazardous wastes and other hazardous materials; transportation, handling and disposal of wastes and other materials; labeling of pesticides and similar substances; and investigation and remediation of the release of hazardous materials. In addition, environmental laws impose a liability on owners and operators for investigation and remediation of contaminated property and on a party that sends hazardous materials to those contaminated properties for treatment, storage, disposal or recycling. In some instances, that liability exists regardless of fault. Our global grain and processing and country operations businesses are also subject to laws and related regulations and rules administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies that govern processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling, and quality and safety of feed and grain products. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations and rules could subject us to administrative penalties, injunctive relief, civil remedies and possible product recalls. The hedging transactions and activities of our global grain and processing and country operations businesses are subject to the rules and regulations of the exchanges we use and to the governing bodies, such as the CME, the Chicago Board of Trade (\"CBOT\"), the Minneapolis Grain Exchange (\"MGEX\") and the CFTC.\nCompetition. In our Ag segment, we have significant competition in the businesses in which we operate based principally on price, services, quality, patronage and alternative products. Our businesses depend on relationships with member cooperatives and private retailers; proximity to customers and producers; competitive pricing; and safety of food, feed and grain products. We compete with other large distributors of agricultural products, as well as with other regional or local distributors, cooperatives, retailers and manufacturers.\nNITROGEN PRODUCTION\nOverview\nOur Nitrogen Production segment consists of our approximate 9% membership interest (based on product tons) in CF Nitrogen, our strategic venture with CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (\"CF Industries\"), and allocated expenses. In connection with our investment in CF Nitrogen, we entered into a supply agreement with CF Nitrogen that entitles us to purchase up to 1.1 million tons of granular urea and 580,000 tons of urea ammonium nitrate (\"UAN\") annually for ratable delivery through fiscal 2096. We account for our CF Nitrogen investment using the hypothetical liquidation at book value method. On August 31, 2023, our investment was approximately $2.6 billion. See Note 6, Investments, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements that are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nWe believe that our investment in CF Nitrogen positions us and our members for long-term, dependable fertilizer supply, supply chain efficiency and production economics. In addition, the ability to source products from CF Nitrogen production facilities under our supply agreement benefits our members and customers through strategically positioned access to essential fertilizer products.\nOperations\nCF Nitrogen has six production facilities located in Donaldsonville, Louisiana; Port Neal, Iowa; Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada; Yazoo City, Mississippi; and Woodward and Verdigris, Oklahoma. Natural gas is the principal raw material and primary fuel source used in the ammonia production process. CF Nitrogen has access to competitively priced natural gas through a reliable network of pipelines connected to major natural gas trading hubs near its production facilities.\nProducts and Services\nCF Nitrogen produces nitrogen-based products, including methanol, UAN, urea and related products.\nSales and Marketing: Customers\nCF Nitrogen has three customers, including CHS and two consolidated subsidiaries of CF Industries.\nIndustry: Competition\nRegulation. CF Nitrogen is subject to laws and related regulations and rules designed to protect the environment that are administered by the EPA and similar government agencies. These laws, regulations and rules govern, among other things, discharge of materials into the environment, including air and water; reporting storage of hazardous wastes and other hazardous materials; handling and disposal of wastes and other materials; and investigation and remediation of the release of hazardous materials. In addition, environmental laws impose a liability on owners and operators for investigation and remediation of contaminated property and on a party that sends hazardous materials to those contaminated properties for treatment, storage, disposal or recycling. In some instances, that liability exists regardless of fault.\nCompetition. CF Nitrogen competes primarily on delivered price and, to a lesser extent, on customer service and product quality. CF Nitrogen competes domestically with large companies in the fertilizer industry. There is also significant competition from products sourced from other regions of the world.\nCORPORATE AND OTHER\nCHS Capital. Our wholly-owned financing subsidiary, CHS Capital, LLC (\"CHS Capital\"), provides member cooperatives with loans that meet commercial agriculture needs. These loans include operating, term, revolving and other short- and long-term options. CHS Capital also provides loans to individual producers for crop inputs, feed and hedging-related margin calls. Producer operating loans are also offered in strategic geographic regions.\nCHS Hedging. Our wholly-owned commodity brokerage subsidiary, CHS Hedging, LLC (\"CHS Hedging\"), is a registered, CFTC-regulated futures commission merchant (\"FCM\") and a clearing member of the CBOT, CME, NYMEX and MGEX. CHS Hedging provides consulting services and commodity risk management services primarily in the grains, oilseeds, fertilizer, livestock, dairy and energy markets. CHS Hedging is also the FCM for the majority of our commodity futures trading.\nFoods. Ventura Foods is a joint venture between CHS and Mitsui & Co., with each company owning 50% interest. Ventura Foods produces and distributes edible oil-based products. We account for our investment in Ventura Foods using the equity method of accounting, and the investment balance was equal to $519.2 million on August 31, 2023. See Note 6, Investments, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements that are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nWheat milling. Ardent Mills, the largest flour miller in the United States, is a joint venture with CHS, Cargill and Conagra Brands, Inc. (\"Conagra\"). In connection with the Ardent Mills joint venture, CHS, Cargill and Conagra have various ancillary and noncompete agreements including, among other things, an agreement for us to supply Ardent Mills with certain wheat and durum products. We hold a 12% interest in Ardent Mills and account for our investment as an equity method investment due to our ability to exercise significant influence by appointing a member of the Board of Shareholders and Board of Managers of Ardent Mills. On August 31, 2023, our investment in Ardent Mills was $265.1 million. See Note 6, Investments, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements that are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nHUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur human capital resources objectives include identifying, attracting, retaining, developing, incentivizing and onboarding our current and new employees. We monitor our progress toward these objectives by measuring human capital metrics such as engagement, total and regrettable turnover, hiring statistics and overall cost of human resources delivery. In addition to these objectives, we also promote a culture focused on diversity and inclusion, provide learning and development opportunities, maintain the health and safety of our employees, encourage community involvement and offer competitive pay and benefits. Additional information regarding our employee population and human capital strategies is described below.\nEmployee population. On August 31, 2023, we had 10,609 full-time, part-time, temporary and seasonal employees, primarily in the United States. Of that total, 2,402 were employed in our Energy segment, 6,315 were employed in our Ag segment and 1,892 were employed in Corporate and Other. In addition to those individuals directly employed by us, many individuals work for or support our joint ventures, including CF Nitrogen in our Nitrogen Production segment and Ventura Foods and Ardent Mills in our Corporate and Other category, and are not included in these totals. As of August 31, 2023, we had 11 collective bargaining agreements with unions covering approximately 8% of our employees in the United States, with collective bargaining agreements expiring on various dates through August 31, 2026. We believe that our relations with our employees are strong. We value our employees and believe that employee passion for our work and employee engagement are key elements of our operating performance.\nDiversity and inclusion. The CHS value of inclusion compels us to create a work environment where excellence and growth stem from diverse thinking. Our goal is to foster a workplace where diverse thinking, voices and backgrounds yield better employee experiences, business performance and business outcomes. In addition to working on modeling inclusive behaviors that positively impact our communities, with the assistance of external experts, we developed and launched an enterprisewide three-year strategic plan in fiscal 2021 to improve inclusion and diversity at CHS. We sponsor and support employee resource groups made up of individuals who join together as allies and advocates to promote diversity and inclusion, while providing our employees across the country the opportunity to strengthen relationships, learn through educational and networking opportunities that focus on development, help local communities and engage with people across CHS. These employee resource groups include Harvest Pride, which promotes a safe, connected and empowered LGBTQA+ community across CHS; Mozaiko, which promotes ethnic diversity and inclusion at CHS while supporting an inclusive environment for all employees; VERG, which provides support, camaraderie and resources for employees formerly or currently serving in the military and their families; Women in Leadership, which supports women in the workplace to grow personally and professionally; and CultivateHER, a cohort within Women in Leadership, which supports women across our Ag segment.\nLearning and development. We are committed to investing in our employees to help them build knowledge, develop skills and achieve their career goals. In addition to regular performance evaluations and annual development plans that provide employees with feedback and growth opportunities, employees at CHS have access to a variety of learning tools and other opportunities for growth. These tools and opportunities include access to on-demand learning modules; internal and external trainings that cover continuous improvement, public speaking, finance and accounting topics and other subjects; tuition and professional certification reimbursement; as well as other opportunities focused on developing the future leaders of CHS.\nHealth and safety. Safety is one of our core values. At CHS, safety is about more than just following the rules, it is about doing things the right way and remembering that no job is so critical that it warrants safety risks. In addition to defined safety programs designed specifically for individual facilities with operational hazards related to grain, feed, seed, agronomy, petroleum, warehouses and retail operations, we also provide certain employee groups with additional training opportunities such as a defensive driving program. Beyond developing defined safety programs and training opportunities, we monitor our incident rates in comparison to previous years and industry averages, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. During fiscal 2023, our Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") incident rate was 2.7 incidents per 100 full-time workers, as compared to an average of 3.2 incidents per 100 full-time workers during the three previous years, a reduction of 18%. Additionally, our lost-time injury rate was 0.9 incidents per 100 full-time workers, a 20% reduction over our three-year average, and our DOT crash rate remained in the top 5% (most favorable) of all carriers in our industry segment for the third consecutive year.\nCommunity involvement. As a cooperative, we are committed to making a measurable impact in our communities through our giving investments. In addition to our charitable foundation and annual giving campaign, which provide financial support to our communities, eligible employees also receive paid time off to make a difference in our communities through volunteer activities. During fiscal 2023, our charitable foundation gave approximately $6.7 million in charitable donations.\nCompensation and benefits. We have designed our compensation and benefits programs to attract and retain qualified employees and to motivate employees to optimize member-owner returns and to achieve our short- and long-term strategies. In\naddition to offering competitive compensation that includes annual variable pay linked to company and individual employee performance, we also offer a wide array of benefits programs that include health insurance and wellness benefits; retirement benefits, including a company-matched 401(k) contribution and a pension for qualifying employees; paid time off and family leave; and employee assistance programs, including adoption assistance.\nCHS AUTHORIZED CAPITAL\nWe are an agricultural membership cooperative organized under Minnesota cooperative law to do business with member and nonmember patrons. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS\nOF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains and our other publicly available documents may contain, and our officers, directors and other representatives may from time to time make, \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"goal,\" \"seek,\" \"believe,\" \"project,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"strategy,\" \"future,\" \"likely,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" \"will\" and similar references to future periods. Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our businesses, financial condition and results of operations, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside our control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements are discussed or identified in our public filings made with the SEC, including in this \"Risk Factors\" discussion. Any forward-looking statements made by us in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based only on information currently available to us and speak only as of the date on which the statement is made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.\nReference to this cautionary statement (the \"Cautionary Statement\") in the context of a forward-looking statement shall be deemed to be a statement that any one or more of the following factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statement.\nThe following risk factors are in addition to any other cautionary statements, written or oral, which may be made or referred to in connection with any particular forward-looking statement. The following risk factors should not be construed as exhaustive. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently view to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Operating Our Business\nOur revenues, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by changes in commodity prices.\nOur revenues, results of operations and cash flows are affected by market prices for commodities such as crude oil, natural gas, ethanol, fertilizer, grain, oilseed, flour, and crude and refined vegetable oils. Commodity prices generally are affected by a wide range of factors beyond our control, including weather, plant disease, insect damage, drought, availability and adequacy of supply, availability of reliable rail and river transportation networks, industry labor availability, outbreaks of disease, inflation, government regulation and policies, global trade disputes, international conflicts, such as the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and escalation of conflict in the Middle East, and general political and economic conditions. We are also exposed to fluctuating commodity prices as the result of our inventories of commodities, typically grain, fertilizer and petroleum products, and purchase and sale contracts at fixed or partially fixed prices. At any time, our inventory levels and unfulfilled fixed or partially fixed price contract obligations may be substantial. We have processes in place to monitor exposures to these risks and engage in strategies, such as hedging, to manage these risks. If these controls and strategies are not successful in mitigating our exposure to these fluctuations, we could be materially and adversely affected. For example, fluctuations in commodity prices may result in significant noncash losses being incurred on our commodity-based derivatives,\nwhich may in turn materially and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, changes in market prices for commodities that we purchase without a corresponding change in the selling prices of those products can affect revenues and operating earnings. Similarly, increased or decreased sales volumes without a corresponding change in the purchase and/or selling prices of those products can affect revenues and operating earnings.\nIn our energy operations, profitability depends largely on the margin between the cost of crude oil that we refine and the selling prices we obtain for our refined products. The prices for crude oil and for gasoline, diesel fuel and other refined petroleum products fluctuate widely. Factors influencing these prices, many of which are beyond our control, include:\nlevels of worldwide and domestic supplies;\ncapacities of domestic and foreign refineries;\nability of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\"OPEC\") and other countries that are significant producers of oil to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls, and the price and level of imports;\ndisruption in supply;\npolitical instability or conflict in oil-producing regions;\nlevel of demand from consumers, agricultural producers and other customers;\nprice and availability of alternative fuels;\navailability of pipeline capacity; and\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes.\nMany of these factors, including the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and escalation of conflict in the Middle East, have resulted in significant volatility in crude oil, refined petroleum products and natural gas supplies and prices. We expect that volatility to continue in fiscal 2024. The long-term effects of this volatility and other conditions on the prices of crude oil, refined petroleum products and natural gas are uncertain and ever-changing. Increases in crude oil prices without a corresponding increase in the prices of our refined petroleum products, and decreases in crude oil prices with larger corresponding decreases in the prices of our refined petroleum products, would reduce our net income. Accordingly, we expect our margins and the profitability of our energy business to fluctuate, possibly significantly, over time.\nOur renewable fuels business produces ethanol, which is closely related to, or may be substituted for, petroleum products, and may be blended into gasoline to increase octane content. Therefore, the selling price of ethanol can be impacted by the selling prices of gasoline, diesel fuel and other octane enhancers. A significant decrease in the price of gasoline, diesel fuel or other octane enhancers could result in a significant decrease in the selling price of ethanol, which could adversely affect our revenues and operating earnings. In addition, we expect the volume of renewable fuels produced by our competitors to increase going forward. As the market for renewable fuels becomes more competitive, or if there are changes in the regulations, policies or standards affecting the demand for renewable fuels, our renewable fuels business may experience increased volatility in product margins, which could adversely affect our operating earnings.\nIn addition, in recent decades, there have been periods worldwide of both overproduction and underproduction of hydrocarbons and periods of both increased and relaxed energy conservation efforts. Such conditions have resulted in periods of excess supply of, and reduced demand for, crude oil on a worldwide basis and for natural gas on a domestic basis. These periods have been followed by periods of short supply of, and increased demand for, crude oil and natural gas. The cycles of excess or short supply of crude oil or natural gas have placed pressure on prices and resulted in dramatic price fluctuations even during relatively short periods of seasonal market demand. These fluctuations impact the accuracy of assumptions used in our budgeting process.\nWe are subject to political, economic, legal and other risks of doing business globally.\nWe are a global business and are exposed to risks associated with having global operations. These risks include, but are not limited to, risks relating to terrorism, war or civil unrest; changes in a country's or region's social, economic or political conditions; changes in local labor conditions and regulations; changes in safety and environmental regulations; changes in regulatory or legal environments; expropriation or impoundment of assets; restrictions on currency exchange activities and currency exchange fluctuations; price and export controls or bans on commodities; taxes; doing business in countries or regions with inadequate infrastructure; and logistics challenges. In addition, some countries where we operate lack well-developed legal systems or have not adopted clear legal and regulatory frameworks. This lack of legal certainty exposes our operations to increased risks, including increased difficulty in enforcing our agreements in those jurisdictions and increased risk of adverse actions by local government authorities, such as unilateral or forced renegotiation, modification or nullification of existing agreements or expropriations.\nOngoing wars and global conflicts may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine (the \"war\") and in October 2023, conflict escalated in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas. The war between Russia and Ukraine and escalation of conflict in the Middle East have resulted in significant uncertainty and instability in the global commodities markets, including agricultural commodities and crude oil. In response to the war, the United States and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization (\"NATO\") member states, as well as nonmember states, announced economic sanctions targeting Russia and certain Russian citizens and enterprises, including several large banks. The continuation of the war may trigger a series of additional economic and other sanctions enacted by the United States, other NATO member states and other countries. In response, Russia has announced export bans on various products, including agricultural commodities. Although we do not maintain operations in Russia, it is a significant source of fertilizer for global markets. Such sanctions have caused inflationary pressures and impacted our ability to purchase fertilizer in the global market. If our ability to purchase fertilizer in the global market continues to be impacted by those sanctions or by other factors, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. In addition, such sanctions put us at an increased risk of inadvertently trading with a sanctioned partner.\nWe maintain limited operations in Ukraine, which is a key international grain-originating region. Our operations in Ukraine have been dramatically disrupted because of the war; however, we continue to originate grain in Ukraine for safe transit through our Romanian export channels. The ongoing war could cause harm to our employees and otherwise impair their ability to work for extended periods of time, as well as disrupt telecommunications systems, banks and other critical infrastructure necessary to conduct business in Ukraine.\nThe risk of cybersecurity incidents has also increased in connection with the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. For example, the war has been accompanied by cyberattacks against the Ukrainian government and other countries in the region. It is possible that these attacks could have collateral effects on additional critical infrastructure and financial institutions globally, which could adversely affect our operations. The proliferation of malware from the war into systems unrelated to the war, or cyberattacks against U.S. companies in retaliation for U.S. sanctions against Russia or U.S. support of Ukraine, could also adversely affect our operations.\nThe war between Russia and Ukraine and escalation of conflict in the Middle East could also draw military or other intervention from additional countries, which could lead to much larger wars, conflicts and/or additional sanctions imposed by the United States government and other governments that restrict business with specific persons, organizations or countries with respect to certain products or services. If such escalation should occur or such sanctions are imposed, supply chain, trade routes and markets currently served by us could be adversely affected, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. Furthermore, the actions undertaken by western nations in response to Russia's actions have had, and may continue to have, adverse impacts on global financial markets.\nWe may also experience negative reactions from our members, shareholders, lenders, employees, customers or other stakeholders as a result of our action or inaction related to the war between Russia and Ukraine or the escalation of conflict in the Middle East.\nEven if the war and global conflicts moderate or resolutions are reached, we expect that we will continue to experience ongoing financial and operational impacts resulting from the war and global conflicts for the foreseeable future. Additionally, certain of the economic and other sanctions imposed, or that may be imposed, against participants in the war and global conflicts and its citizens and enterprises may continue for a period of time after any resolution has been reached.\nOur business and operations and demand for our products are highly dependent on certain global and regional factors that are outside our control and could adversely impact our business.\nThe level of demand for our products is affected by global and regional demographics and macroeconomic conditions, including population growth rates and changes in standards of living. A significant downturn in global economic growth or recessionary conditions in major geographic regions may lead to a reduced demand for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects. Weak global economic conditions and adverse conditions in financial and capital markets may adversely impact the financial condition and liquidity of some of our customers, suppliers and other counterparties, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers' abilities to pay for our products and on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects.\nAdditionally, planted acreage and consequently the volume of crop nutrient and crop protection products applied is partially dependent on government programs, grain prices and the perception held by producers of demand for production, all of which are outside our control. Moreover, our business and operations may be affected by fluctuations in freight and logistics costs, disruptions in supply channels between parties and locations that include our suppliers, production and storage facilities,\ntolling and packaging partners, distributors and customers, and weather conditions, including those due to climate change, that are outside our control. The following are examples of factors that could impact our businesses:\nWeather conditions during the spring planting season and early summer crop nutrient and crop protection application season affect agronomy product volumes and profitability.\nAdverse weather conditions, such as drought, heavy snowfall or rainfall and any flooding that results, may cause transportation delays and increased transportation costs or damage physical assets, especially facilities in low-lying areas near coasts and riverbanks or situated in hurricane-prone and/or rain-susceptible regions.\nChanges in weather patterns may shift periods of demand for products or regions in which our products are produced or distributed, which could require us to revise our procurement and distribution processes.\nSignificant changes in water levels (up or down, as a result of flooding, drought or otherwise) may cause changes in agricultural activity, which could require changes to our operating and distribution activities, as well as significant capital improvements to our facilities.\nClimate change may cause changes in weather patterns and conditions, including changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature levels, all of which could adversely impact our costs and business operations; the location, cost and competitiveness of commodity agricultural production; related storage and processing facilities; and demand for agricultural commodities, and may result in incidents of stranded physical assets. The frequency and severity of the effects of climate change and changes in weather patterns have been increasing. These effects could significantly reduce demand for the products we sell to or buy from agricultural producers and local cooperatives, and therefore could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.\nWe may experience increased insurance premiums and deductibles or decreases in available coverage for our assets in areas subject to adverse weather conditions.\nEmerging sustainability and other environmental priorities outside our control could also affect agricultural practices and future demand for agronomy products applied to crops and the volume of any such application. These priorities could also impact demand for our grain and energy products, and may require us to incur additional costs for increased due diligence and reporting. Accordingly, factors outside our control could materially and adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and cash flows.\nInflation may result in increased costs, which could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe have experienced and anticipate continued effects of inflation on costs such as labor, freight, natural gas and materials. In response to global inflationary pressures, the U.S. Federal Reserve and foreign equivalents have raised and appear poised to continue to raise interest rates, which has resulted in uncertainty and volatility in global financial markets and increased borrowing costs under certain of our credit facilities, including our five-year revolving credit facility and our 10-year term loan facility. Inflation and its impacts, many of which are beyond our control, could escalate in the future. To mitigate commodity cost increases, we have implemented various strategies that include, among other things, entering into contracted pricing with certain vendors, procuring commodities in periods of favorable market conditions and entering into various derivative instruments. These actions may, in part, mitigate these increased costs, but even by increasing our product prices and passing some or all of our increased costs to customers or implementing cost savings efforts, we may not be able to fully offset these increased costs. Additionally, increased prices may not be sustainable over time and may result in reduced sales volumes. Accordingly, inflationary pressures could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations. There can be no guarantee that our efforts to mitigate commodity cost increases due to inflationary pressures will be effective or, if they are effective, that they will have a material impact on maintaining or reducing costs.\nWe participate in highly competitive business markets and we may not be able to continue to compete successfully, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe operate in highly competitive business segments and our competitors may succeed in developing new or enhanced products that are better than ours, may be more successful in marketing and selling their products than we are, or may have more effective supply chain capabilities than we have. Competitive factors include price, service level, proximity to markets, access to transportation, product quality, marketing and risk management. In particular, competitive pressures may restrict our ability to increase prices and maintain those price increases, including price increases made in response to commodity and other cost increases. We may experience delays between the time that we take inflation-related pricing actions and the time that we realize the impact of those actions on our margins and results of operations. In our business segments, we compete with companies that are larger and better known than we are and have greater marketing, financial, personnel and other resources than we do. For example, in conjunction with the recent increase in demand for renewable diesel feedstocks, we have experienced added competition for soybean oil refining capacity from traditional petroleum companies. As a result, we may not\nbe able to continue to compete successfully, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects.\nOur revenues, margins, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if our members were to do business with other companies rather than with us.\nWe do not have an exclusive relationship with our members and our members are not obligated to supply us with their products or purchase products from us. Our members often have a variety of distribution outlets and product sources available to them. If our members were to sell their products to other purchasers or purchase products from other sellers, our revenues and margins would decline and our results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf our customers choose alternatives to our refined petroleum products, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nNumerous energy sources could serve as alternatives to our gasoline, diesel fuel and other refined petroleum products. If any of these alternative products become more economically viable or preferable to our customers for environmental or other reasons, demand for our energy products would decline. In addition, many governments have imposed, and in the future may impose, policies and regulations aimed at decreasing reliance on petroleum-based products, which could reduce demand for our energy products. For example, California has passed legislation to ban new gasoline powered vehicles by 2035 and Illinois has enacted comprehensive legislation that aims to phase out fossil fuels by 2045. As another example, in December 2021, the current U.S. administration issued an executive order that directs the U.S. federal government to use its scale and procurement power to achieve a number of aspirational net-zero goals, including 100% zero-emission, light-duty vehicle acquisitions by 2027 and 100% zero-emission vehicle acquisitions by 2035. If realized, these restrictions would accelerate the decline in demand for gasoline, diesel fuel and other refined petroleum products. In addition, a number of companies have announced their intention to phase out production of gasoline- and diesel-powered light-duty vehicles. While these phaseouts primarily impact light-duty vehicles outside our primary markets, they are expected to accelerate the decline in demand for gasoline, diesel fuel and other refined petroleum products. Declining demand for our energy products, particularly diesel fuel sold for farming and other heavy-duty equipment applications, could materially and adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and cash flows.\nConsolidation among the producers of products we purchase and customers for products we sell could materially and adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and cash flows.\nConsolidation has occurred among the producers and manufacturers of products we sell and purchase, including crude oil, crop nutrients and grain, and it is highly likely this consolidation will continue in the future. Consolidation could allow producers to negotiate pricing, supply availability and other contract terms that are less favorable to us. In addition, consolidation may increase the likelihood that consumers or end users of these products enter into supply relationships with a smaller number of producers, resulting in potentially higher prices for the products we purchase.\nConsolidation has occurred among member cooperatives that are the primary wholesale customers of our products, which has resulted in a smaller wholesale and retail customer base for our products and has intensified the competition for these customers. It is highly likely this consolidation will continue in the future. Ongoing consolidation among distributors and brokers of food products and food retailers has altered the buying patterns of those businesses, as they have increasingly elected to work with product suppliers who can meet their needs nationwide or globally, rather than just regionally or locally. If these cooperatives, distributors, brokers and retailers elect to not purchase our products, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn the seed, crop nutrient and crop protection markets, consolidation at both the producer and wholesale customer levels has increased the potential for direct sales from input manufacturers to cooperative customers and/or individual agricultural producers, which would remove us from the supply chain and could have a material and adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to risk of nonperformance and nonpayment by counterparties.\nWe are exposed to risk of nonperformance and nonpayment by counterparties, whether pursuant to contracts or otherwise. Risk of nonperformance and nonpayment by counterparties includes the inability or refusal of a counterparty to pay us; the inability or refusal to perform because of a counterparty's financial condition and liquidity, operational failures, labor issues, cybersecurity events, outbreaks of disease or for any other reason; and risk that the counterparty will refuse to perform a contract during a period of price fluctuations where contract prices are significantly different than current market prices. In the\nevent we experience significant nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. For example, we store inventory in third-party warehouses, and the operators of these warehouses may not adequately store or secure our inventory, or they may improperly sell that inventory to someone else, which could expose us to a loss of the value of that inventory. In the event we experience any such nonperformance by a third-party warehouse operator, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. As another example, if any of our counterparties experience a cybersecurity breach or system failure, or does not respond or perform effectively in connection with such cybersecurity breach or system failure, their businesses could be negatively impacted, and it may result in disruption to our supply chain or distribution channels, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business, profitability and liquidity may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of, or defaults by, third parties who owe us money.\nWe extend credit to, make loans to and engage in other financing arrangements with individual producers, local cooperatives and other third parties around the world. We incur credit risk and the risk of losses if our borrowers and others to which we extend credit do not repay their loans or perform their obligations to pay us the money they owe. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or for other reasons. If these counterparties do not pay us back and we experience significant defaults on their payment obligations to us, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are also subject to the risk that our rights against borrowers and other third parties that owe us money may not be enforceable in all circumstances. For example, a borrower or third-party may declare bankruptcy. In addition, the credit quality of borrowers and other third parties whose obligations we hold could deteriorate due to a number of factors, including deterioration in the value of collateral posted by those parties to secure their obligations to us pursuant to purchase contracts, loan agreements or other contracts. If deterioration occurs, the material adverse effects of third parties not performing their repayment obligations may be exacerbated if the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount owed to us. For example, certain loans and other financing arrangements we undertake with agricultural producers are typically secured by the counterparty's crops planted in the current year. There is a risk that the value of the crop will not be sufficient to satisfy the counterparty's repayment obligations under the financing arrangement as a result of weather; crop-growing conditions; other factors that influence the price, supply and demand for agricultural commodities; or for other reasons.\nIn addition, disputes may arise as to the amount of collateral we are entitled to receive and the value of pledged assets. Termination of contracts and foreclosure on collateral may subject us to claims for improper exercise of our rights. Default rates, downgrades and disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral increase significantly in times of market stress and illiquidity.\nWith respect to our lending activity, we evaluate the collectability of commercial and producer loans on a specific identification basis based on the amount and quality of the collateral obtained and record specific loan loss reserves when appropriate. Consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\"), we maintain a general reserve based on our best estimate of expected credit losses. For other forms of credit, we establish reserves as appropriate and consistent with U.S. GAAP. The reserves represent our best estimate based on current facts and circumstances. Future developments or changes in assumptions may cause us to record adjustments to the reserves that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur risk management strategies may not be effective.\nOur business is affected by fluctuations in commodity prices, transportation costs, energy prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We monitor position limits, accounts receivables and other exposures and engage in other strategies and controls to manage these risks. Our monitoring efforts may not be effective at detecting a significant risk exposure and our controls and strategies may not be effective in adequately managing against the occurrence of a significant loss relating to a risk exposure. If our controls and strategies are not successful in mitigating or preventing our financial exposure to losses due to the fluctuations or failures mentioned above, it could significantly and adversely affect our operating results.\nActual or perceived quality, safety or health risks associated with our products could subject us to significant liability and damage our business and reputation.\nIf any of our food or animal feed products were to become adulterated or misbranded, we would need to recall those items and could experience product liability claims if either consumers or customers' livestock or pets were injured or were claimed to be injured as a result. A widespread product recall or a significant product liability judgment could cause our products to be unavailable for a period of time or could cause a loss of consumer or customer confidence in our products. Even if a product liability claim were unsuccessful or were not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our business and reputation with existing and potential consumers and customers and our corporate and brand image. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers has greatly increased the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands, or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. Moreover, product liability claims or liabilities might not be covered by our insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others. In addition, general public perceptions regarding the quality, safety or health risks associated with particular food or animal feed products, such as concerns regarding genetically modified crops, could reduce demand and prices for some of the products associated with our businesses. To the extent that consumer preferences evolve away from products that our members or we produce for health or other reasons, such as the growing demand for organic food products and products that are sustainably grown and made, including low-carbon grain and oilseed, and we are unable to develop or procure products that satisfy new consumer preferences, there will be decreased demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects.\nOur operations are subject to business interruptions, casualty losses and supply chain issues. We do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unanticipated liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to business interruptions due to unanticipated events such as explosions, fires, other natural disasters, war, terrorism, cyberattacks, industrial accidents, pipeline interruptions, transportation delays, equipment failures, crude oil or refined product spills, adverse weather conditions and labor disputes. The following statements are examples of potential interruptions or losses.\nOur oil refineries and other facilities are potential targets for terrorist attacks that could halt or discontinue production.\nOur inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with unionized workers in our operations could result in strikes or work stoppages.\nOur corporate headquarters, the facilities we own and the inventories we carry could be damaged or destroyed by catastrophic events, adverse weather conditions or contamination.\nSomeone may accidentally or intentionally introduce malware into our information technology systems or breach our computer systems or other cybersecurity resources.\nAn occurrence of a pandemic or epidemic disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could affect a substantial part of our workforce or our customers and interrupt our business operations.\nThe effects of any of these events could be significant. We maintain insurance coverage against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from these operating hazards, but uninsured losses or losses above our coverage limits are possible. Uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, our insurance premiums could increase or insurance coverage may become unavailable to us, particularly if we experience insurable events.\nWe may also be impacted by supply chain issues, due to factors largely beyond our control, which could escalate in future periods. Any such issues could result in higher costs or operational disruptions, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business and operations have been, and may in the future, be adversely affected by epidemics, pandemics, outbreaks of disease and other adverse public health developments, including COVID-19.\nEpidemics, pandemics, outbreaks of novel diseases and other adverse public health developments in countries and states where we operate may arise at any time. Such developments, including the COVID-19 pandemic, have had, and in the future may have, an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These effects include a potentially negative impact on the availability of our key personnel; labor shortages and increased turnover; temporary closures of our facilities or facilities of our members, business partners, customers, suppliers, third-party service providers or other vendors; and interruption of domestic and global supply chains, distribution channels and liquidity and capital or financial markets. In particular, restrictions on or disruptions of transportation, port closures or increased border controls or closures, or\nother impacts on domestic and global supply chains or distribution channels could increase our costs for raw materials and commodity costs, increase demand for raw materials and commodities from competing purchasers, limit our ability to meet customer demand or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or cash flows. Precautionary measures we may take in the future intended to limit the impact of any epidemic, pandemic, disease outbreak or other public health development, may result in additional costs. In addition, such epidemics, pandemics, disease outbreaks or other public health developments may adversely affect economies and financial markets throughout the world, such as the effect COVID-19 has had on world economies and financial markets, which may affect our ability to obtain additional financing for our businesses and demand for our products and services. The impact of such developments may also exacerbate the other risks discussed in this Item 1A, any of which could have a material effect on us. The extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business and our financial results in the future will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Such developments may include ongoing spread of the virus; disease severity; outbreak duration; extent of any reoccurrence of the coronavirus or any evolutions or mutations of the virus; availability, administration and effectiveness of vaccines; development of therapeutic treatments that can restore consumer and business economic confidence; type and duration of actions that may be taken by governmental authorities in response to the outbreak; and impact on the U.S. and the global economy. While all of our facilities are currently operating normally, our internal task force is prepared to reestablish safety measures and protocols should infection rates of COVID-19 increase. We continue to monitor local, regional and national government actions that could limit or restrict the movement of agricultural commodities or products or otherwise disrupt physical product flows or our ability to operate in the future. As a result, at the time of this filing, it is not possible to predict the overall future impact of COVID-19 or any other adverse public health development on our business, liquidity, capital resources and financial results.\nWe are subject to workforce factors that could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nLike most companies in the agricultural industry, we are continuously challenged to hire, develop and retain a sufficient number of employees to operate our businesses throughout our operating geographies. We may have difficulty recruiting and retaining employees with adequate qualifications and experience. The challenge of hiring new employees is exacerbated by the rural nature of our business, which provides for a smaller pool of skilled employable candidates. A number of other factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us, including changes in the labor market as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and other socioeconomic and demographic changes, high employment levels, federal unemployment subsidies and other government regulations, unemployment programs and volatility in macroeconomic factors impacting the labor market. Moreover, there continues to be a tight labor market despite the COVID-19 pandemic having largely subsided. Increases in remote work opportunities have also amplified the competition for employees and contractors. To hire new employees, we may be forced to pay higher wages or offer other benefits that might impact our cost of labor. Furthermore, when we do hire new employees, lengthy training and orientation periods might be required before they are able to achieve necessary productivity levels, and we may be unable to successfully transfer our other employees' institutional knowledge and skills to them or fail to execute on internal succession plans. In addition, an increasingly competitive labor market may lead to increased turnover rates within our employee base. Increased employee turnover results in significant time and expense relating to identifying recruiting, hiring, relocating and integrating qualified individuals. High employee turnover of key personnel may further deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiveness. These or other employee workforce factors could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTechnological improvements and sustainability initiatives could decrease the demand for our agronomy and energy products.\nTechnological advances in agriculture, as well as sustainability initiatives and practices, could decrease the demand for crop nutrients, energy and other crop input products and services we provide. Genetically engineered seeds that resist disease and insects, or that meet certain nutritional requirements, could affect the demand for our crop nutrients and crop protection products. Demand for fuel we sell could decline as technology allows for more efficient usage of equipment or should alternative energy sources become more viable due to technological advances. Declining demand for our products could materially and adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe utilize information technology systems to support our business. The ongoing multiyear implementation of an enterprisewide resource planning system, reliance on multiple legacy business systems, security breaches or other disruptions to our information technology systems or assets could interfere with our operations, compromise the security of our customers' or suppliers' information and expose us to liability that could adversely impact our business and reputation.\nOur operations rely on certain key information technology (\"IT\") systems, many of which are legacy in nature or may depend on third-party services to provide critical connections of data, information and services for internal and external users.\nOver the past several years, we have been implementing a new enterprise resource planning system (\"ERP\"), and we expect this ERP implementation to continue for the next several years. This ERP implementation has required and will continue to require significant capital and human resources to deploy. Changes we have experienced in the implementation timeline and the scope of the implementation likely have impacted the capital and operating expense amounts required to complete the implementation, and there can be no assurance that the actual costs for completing the ERP implementation will not exceed our current estimates or that the ERP will not take longer to implement than we currently expect. In addition, potential flaws in implementing the ERP or in the failure of any portion/module of the ERP to meet our needs or provide appropriate controls may pose risks to our ability to operate successfully and efficiently and with an effective system of internal controls.\nThere may be other challenges and risks to both our aging and current IT systems over time due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, availability of resources, power outages, security breaches or cyberattacks. These challenges and risks could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties, disruption in operations, loss of valuable data, increased costs and damage to our reputation, all of which could adversely affect our business. Our ongoing IT investments include those relating to cybersecurity, including technology, hired expertise and cybersecurity risk mitigation actions. In addition, IT investments in new technology that could result in greater operational efficiency may further expose our IT systems to the risk of cyberattacks.\nThe increase in hybrid working where employees including third-party employees, access technology infrastructure remotely increases additional information technology and data security risks. Like many companies, we continue to experience an increase in the number of sophisticated attempts by external parties to access and/or disrupt our networks without authorization, such as denial of service attacks, attempted malware infections, scanning activity and phishing e-mails. For example, in June 2021, we experienced a denial-of-service attack that impacted our network. In response to the cybersecurity attack, we launched an investigation and undertook immediate action, including employing protocols to mitigate the impact of the threat going forward. Although our systems were not breached, no data was lost or exposed and our operations were not significantly interrupted by this incident, there is no guarantee that a future incident would not have a greater impact on our operations, our data or our reputation. There is no assurance that the measures we have taken to protect our information systems will prevent or limit the impact of a future cybersecurity incident. We may incur significant costs protecting against or remediating cyber-based attacks or other cybersecurity incidents. While we maintain a cybersecurity insurance policy that provides coverage for security incidents, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on financially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim.\nIn addition, we are subject to laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal data. These laws and regulations pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and will require us to incur costs to achieve and maintain compliance; some of those costs may be significant. Any violation of such laws and regulations, including as a result of a security or privacy breach, could subject us to legal claims, regulatory penalties and damage to our reputation. For example, the SEC recently adopted rule, \"Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance and Incident Disclosure,\" that enhances and standardizes disclosures regarding cybersecurity risk management and governance, as well as material cybersecurity incidents. Under this new rule, we will be required to make annual disclosures describing our processes for identifying and managing material cybersecurity risks, management's role in assessing and managing such risks and the Board of Directors' oversight of cybersecurity risks. We will also be required to disclose, in a Form 8-K, the nature, scope and timing of any material cybersecurity incidents identified and the material impact or reasonably likely material impact on the company. We expect to face increased costs to comply with this new SEC cybersecurity rule, including increased costs for cybersecurity training and management. Furthermore, the requirement to report cybersecurity incidents within such a short time frame could mean that there will not be sufficient time to halt a breach before having to report it, potentially giving hackers an advantage.\nIncreasing scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social and governance practices may expose us to new or additional risks.\nCompanies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from stakeholders related to their environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") practices and disclosures, including practices and disclosures related to climate change, human capital management, diversity and inclusion, social and community impact, corporate culture and governance standards. Investor advocacy groups, private litigants, government agencies, certain institutional investors, lenders, investment funds and other influential investors are also increasingly focused on ESG practices and disclosures and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments and whether companies should engage in ESG activities. Across industries, investors' and other stakeholders' increased focus and activism related to ESG and similar matters may hinder access to capital or financing, as investors or lenders may determine to reallocate capital or not commit capital as a result of their assessment of a company's ESG practices and disclosures. In addition, following recent Supreme Court decisions regarding diversity and inclusion activities those opposed to ESG initiatives have begun challenging ESG activities of other companies. If we do not adapt or comply with investor, lender, private litigants, government agencies or stakeholder ESG expectations and standards, which are evolving, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing focus\non ESG issues and the opposition to ESG issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, we may suffer from reputational damage and our business or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Conversely, if we comply with evolving investor, lender and stakeholder ESG expectations and standards, doing so could result in higher costs, disruption and diversion of management attention, increased strain on our resources and heightened legal and regulatory risk, and could also threaten our credibility with other investors, lenders, private litigants, government agencies and stakeholders. Investors, lenders and other stakeholders are also increasingly focusing on issues related to environmental justice. This may result in increased scrutiny, protests and negative publicity with respect to our business and operations, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, business and financial performance.\nFailures or delays in achieving our strategies or expectations related to climate change and other environmental matters could adversely affect our business, operations and reputation, and increase risk of litigation.\nOur ability to achieve any of our strategies or expectations related to climate change and other environmental matters is subject to numerous factors and conditions, many of which are outside our control. Examples of such factors include, but are not limited to, evolving regulatory and other standards, processes and assumptions; the pace of scientific and technological developments; increased costs and the availability of requisite financing; market trends that may alter business opportunities; the conduct of third-party counterparties; constraint or disruptions to our supply chain and changes in carbon markets or carbon taxes. We may be required to expend significant resources to achieve these strategies and expectations, which could significantly increase our operational costs. There can be no assurance of the extent to which any of our strategies or expectations will be achieved or that any future investments we make in furtherance of achieving these strategies or expectations will meet customer or investor expectations.\nWhile we continue to take important steps toward mitigation of climate risk and impact on climate change, transitioning our business to adapt to and comply with evolving policy, legal, and regulatory changes may impose substantial operational and compliance burdens. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business and operations. Collecting, measuring and analyzing information relating to such matters can be costly, time-consuming, dependent on third-party cooperation and unreliable. Furthermore, methodologies for measuring, tracking and reporting on such matters continue to change over time, which requires our processes and controls for such data to evolve as well. Additionally, we may face increased pressure from customers, consumers, investors, activists, lenders and other stakeholders to modify our products or operations away from ingredients or activities that are considered to have a higher impact on climate change.\nSuch changes to methodologies or lack of progress and failures or delays in our strategies, whether actual or perceived, in achieving our strategies or expectations related to climate change and other environmental matters could adversely affect our business, operations and reputation, and increase risk of litigation.\nAcquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, divestitures and other nonordinary course-of-business events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies could affect future results.\nWe monitor our business portfolio and organizational structure and have made and may continue to make acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, divestitures and changes to our organizational structure. With respect to acquisitions, future results will be affected by our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates, to adequately finance any acquisitions and to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated financial returns, including synergies. Our ability to successfully complete a divestiture will depend on, among other things, our ability to identify buyers that are prepared to acquire such assets or businesses on acceptable terms and to adjust and optimize our retained businesses following the divestiture. Additionally, we may fail to consummate proposed acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures or strategic alliances after incurring expenses and devoting substantial resources, including management time, to such transactions or foregoing other strategic opportunities.\nSeveral parts of our business, including our nitrogen production business, our foods business and portions of our global grain marketing and wheat milling operations, are operated through joint ventures with third parties where we do not have majority control of the venture. By operating a business through a joint venture, we have less control over business decisions than we have in our subsidiaries and limited liability companies in which we have a controlling interest. In particular, we generally cannot act on major business initiatives in our joint ventures without the consent of the other party or parties in those ventures. Investments in joint ventures may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present when a third party is not involved, including the possibility that co-venturers might experience business or financial stresses that impact their ability to effectively operate the joint venture, or might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of the business; in which case, the joint venture may be unable to access needed growth capital without funding from us and/or any other remaining co-venturers. Co-venturers may have economic, tax or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. Our co-venturers may take actions that are\nnot within our control, which may expose our investments in joint ventures to the risk of lower values or returns. Joint venture investments may also lead to impasses. Disputes between us and co-venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and efforts on our day-to-day business. In addition, we may, in certain circumstances, be liable for the actions of our co-venturers. Each of these matters could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe have made certain assumptions and projections regarding the future of the markets served by our joint venture investments that included projected raw materiality availability and pricing, production costs, market pricing and demand for the joint venture's products. These assumptions were an integral part of the economics used to evaluate these joint venture investment opportunities prior to consummation. To the extent that actual market performance varies from our models, our ability to achieve projected returns on our joint venture investments may be impacted in a materially adverse manner. For example, assumptions we made in connection with our investment in CF Nitrogen may not align with future demand for nitrogen-based products or the cost or availability of natural gas, the primary feedstock utilized for CF Nitrogen's nitrogen-based products.\nThe collapse of certain banks and potentially other financial institutions may adversely impact us.\nSince March 2023, there have been reports of bank instability across the globe, including several U.S. banks shutting down with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation being appointed as a receiver. Despite the steps taken to date by U.S. agencies to protect depositors, this instability and subsequent pressure on banks could lead to failures of financial institutions to which we face direct or significant exposure, and may lead to significant disruptions to our operations, financial position and reputation. The extent of such impacts is uncertain, and there may be additional risks that we have not yet identified. We are taking steps to identify any potential impact and minimize any disruptions to our operations. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to avoid negative consequences directly or indirectly from the foregoing events or other impacts on financial institutions.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nGovernment policies, mandates, regulations and trade agreements could adversely affect our operations and profitability.\nOur business is subject to numerous government policies, mandates and regulations that could have an adverse effect on our operations or profitability. For example, government policies, mandates and regulations related to genetically modified organisms, traceability standards, sustainable practices, product safety and labeling, and renewable and low-carbon fuels could have an adverse effect on our operations or profitability by, among other things, influencing the planting of certain crops, the location and extent of crop production, trade of processed and unprocessed commodity products, volumes and types of imports and exports, availability and competitiveness of feedstocks as raw materials, and viability and volume of certain of our products. In our Energy segment, government policies, mandates and regulations designed to stop or impede development or production of petroleum-based products, such as those limiting or banning use of hydraulic fracturing, drilling or oilsands production or restricting the sale of new combustion-engine vehicles, could adversely affect our operations and profitability.\nWe could be the target of claims of false or deceptive advertising under U.S. federal and state laws as well as foreign laws, including consumer protection statutes of some states. The marketing of food products has come under increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years, and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive labeling and marketing under federal, state and foreign laws or regulations. Changes in legal or regulatory requirements (such as new food safety requirements and revised nutrition facts labeling, including front-of-pack labeling, and serving size regulations) or evolving interpretations of existing legal or regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results. If we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these areas, we could be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, termination of necessary licenses or permits, or recalls, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, changes in international trade agreements and trade disputes can adversely affect commodity trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions. In many countries around the world, historical free trade relationships are being challenged, and it is unclear what changes, if any, will be made to international trade agreements that are relevant to our business activities. These actions and uncertainties have led to significant volatility in commodity prices, disruptions in historical trade flows and shifts in planting patterns in the United States and South America, all of which have resulted in reduced volumes of grain exports overall and have presented challenges and uncertainties for our business. Changes in trade policy, withdrawals from or material modifications to relevant international trade agreements and continued uncertainty could depress economic activity and restrict our access to suppliers and customers, and we cannot predict the effects of future\ntrade policies, disputes or agreements on our business. Tariffs and trade restrictions that are implemented on products that we buy and/or sell could increase the cost of those products or adversely affect the availability of market access. These cost increases and market changes could adversely affect demand for our products and reduce margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our earnings. In addition, the U.S. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in or with other countries, such as the economic sanctions that were imposed by the U.S. government on Russia and certain of its citizens and enterprises in connection with Russia's war with Ukraine. These restrictions and those of other governments could limit our ability to gain access to business opportunities in various countries.\nChanges in federal income tax laws or in our tax status could increase our tax liability and reduce our net income significantly.\nCurrent federal income tax laws, regulations and interpretations, including those specific to the taxation of cooperatives, provide us certain income tax benefits such as allowing us to exclude income generated through business with or for a member (patronage-sourced income) from our taxable income to the extent it is distributed back to our members. We continue to monitor potential changes to federal income tax laws, regulations or interpretations, such as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, H.R. 5376, to evaluate their potential impact on our business, tax position and financial results. If in the future, for example, we were to be subject to a corporate alternative minimum tax, or we were not eligible to be taxed as a cooperative, our tax liability would significantly increase and our net income would significantly decrease.\nWe incur significant costs in complying with applicable laws and regulations. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or to make capital or other investments necessary to comply with these laws and regulations, could expose us to unanticipated expenditures and liabilities.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state and local provisions regulating our business and operations. We incur and expect to incur significant capital and operating expenses to comply with these laws and regulations. We may be unable to pass on those expenses to customers without experiencing volume and margin losses. For example, the compliance burden and impact on our operations and profitability as a result of the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\"Dodd-Frank\") and related regulations continue to evolve, as federal agencies have implemented and continue to implement the act's many provisions through regulation. These efforts to change the regulation of financial markets subject users of derivatives, such as CHS, to extensive oversight and regulation by the CFTC. Such initiatives have imposed and may continue to impose additional costs on us, including operating and compliance costs, and the cost of fines or penalties in the event we do not comply, and could materially affect the availability, as well as the cost and terms, of certain transactions. Certain federal regulations addressing Dodd-Frank are still being implemented and others are being finalized. We will continue to monitor these developments. In addition, new laws and regulations that are applicable to us or our businesses may be adopted, and the change in the U.S. government's administration and its policies may increase the likelihood of such legal and regulatory developments. If new laws or regulations become applicable to us or our businesses, our compliance costs could increase. Any of the above matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects.\nWe establish reserves for the future cost of known compliance obligations, such as remediation of identified environmental issues. However, these reserves may prove inadequate to meet our actual liability. Moreover, amended, new or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the discovery of currently unknown compliance issues may require us to make material expenditures or subject us to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate. Furthermore, our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to administrative penalties and injunctive relief, civil remedies, including fines and injunctions, criminal fines and penalties, and recalls of our products. For example, we regularly maintain hedges to manage the price risks associated with our commercial operations. These transactions typically take place on exchanges such as the CME. Our hedging transactions and activities are subject to the rules and regulations of the exchanges we use and governing bodies, including the CME, NYMEX, CBOT, MGEX and CFTC. All exchanges have broad powers to review required records, to investigate and enforce compliance and to punish noncompliance by entities subject to their jurisdiction. Failure to comply with such rules and regulations could lead to restrictions on our trading activities or subject us to enforcement action by the CFTC or a disciplinary action by the exchanges, which could lead to substantial fines or penalties or limitations on our related operations. In addition, any investigation or proceeding by an exchange or the CFTC, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs, diversion of resources, including management time, and potential harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects.\nWe are subject to extensive anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-kickback and trade laws and regulations, and any noncompliance with those laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate on a global basis and are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (\"FCPA\"). The FCPA and other similar anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries or agents from making improper payments to government officials or any other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We operate and sell our products in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances strict compliance with anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations may conflict with local customs and practices. In addition, in certain countries, we engage third-party agents or intermediaries to act on our behalf and/or conduct all or a portion of our operations through joint venture partners, including in those countries with a high risk of corruption. If any of these third parties violate applicable anti-corruption, anti-bribery or anti-kickback laws or regulations, we may be liable for those violations. We have policies in place prohibiting employees from making or authorizing improper payments; we train our employees regarding compliance with anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations; and we utilize procedures to identify and mitigate risks of such misconduct by our employees, third-party agents, intermediaries and joint venture partners. However, we cannot provide assurances that our employees, third-party agents, intermediaries or joint venture partners will comply with those policies, laws and regulations. If we are found liable for violations of the FCPA or other similar anti-corruption, anti-bribery or anti-kickback laws or regulations, either due to our own acts or out of inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others, we could suffer criminal or civil fines or penalties or other repercussions, including reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDue to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Antiboycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries. Any alleged or actual violation of these laws or regulations by us or our employees may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation, and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our import and export abilities. Furthermore, embargoes and sanctions imposed by the United States and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries or based on product classification may expose us to potential criminal or civil sanctions. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the way existing laws and regulations might be administered or interpreted.\nEnvironmental and energy laws and regulations may result in increased operating costs and capital expenditures, and may have a material and adverse effect on us.\nNew and current environmental and energy laws and regulations, including regulations relating to alternative energy sources and the risk of global climate change, new interpretations of existing environmental and energy laws and regulations, increased governmental enforcement of environmental and energy laws and regulations, or other developments in these areas could require us to make additional unforeseen expenditures on technologies and/or other assets to continue our operations or unforeseen changes to our operations, either of which could adversely affect us. For example, in December 2015, 195 countries adopted a new international agreement known as the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement is intended to provide a framework pursuant to which the parties to the agreement will attempt to hold the increase in global average temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. Participation in the Paris Agreement is subject to the concurrence of the United States Executive Branch Administration then in office. As a result, adherence to the Paris Agreement may vary by administration. The current administration is supportive of the Paris Agreement. Executive orders issued by the current administration, actions by various U.S. federal regulatory agencies, enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and the current administration's announced goal of halving U.S. greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions by 2030 and reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 are also evidence of the current United States administration's intent to undertake numerous initiatives in an effort to reduce GHGs. New federal legislation or regulatory programs that restrict emissions of GHGs, such as cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, restrictive permitting, increased fuel efficiency standards or mandates for renewable energy, or comparable new state legislation or programs or customer requirements in areas where we or our customers conduct business could adversely affect our operations and the demand for our energy products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects. In addition, new legislation, regulatory programs, or customer or other stakeholder expectations could require substantial expenditures for installation and operation of systems and equipment or for substantial modifications to existing equipment.\nPursuant to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the EPA has promulgated the Renewable Fuel Standard (\"RFS\"), which requires refiners to blend renewable fuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, with their petroleum fuels or purchase renewable energy credits, known as Renewable Identification Numbers (\"RINs\"), in lieu of blending. The EPA generally establishes new annual renewable fuel percentage standards for each compliance year in the preceding year, which affects the domestic market for ethanol. We generate RINs through our blending activities, but we cannot generate enough RINs to meet the needs of our refining capacity and RINs must be purchased on the open market. In recent years, the price of RINs has been extremely volatile. For example, in fiscal 2023, prices for D6 ethanol RINs and D4 ethanol RINs rose by 22% and 5%, respectively, compared to the prior year. Continued RIN volatility could have a negative impact on our future refined fuels margins, as experienced during fiscal 2023. In addition, certain states have established proposed laws around low-carbon fuel standards that require refiners to sell fuel with carbon intensity values at certain established benchmarks, or else purchase a sufficient number of credits on the open market to meet the benchmark.\nEnvironmental liabilities and litigation could have a material adverse effect on us.\nMany of our current and former facilities have been in operation for many years. Over that time, we and other operators of those facilities have generated, used, stored and disposed of substances or wastes, including liquid fertilizers, chemicals and fuels stored in underground and aboveground tanks, that are or might be considered hazardous under applicable or future enacted environmental laws. Any past or future actions in violation of applicable environmental laws could subject us to administrative penalties, fines, injunctions or other costs, such as capital expenditures. In addition, an owner or operator of contaminated property and a party that sends hazardous materials to such site for treatment, storage, disposal or recycling can be liable for the cost of investigation and remediation under environmental laws. In some instances, such liability exists regardless of fault. Moreover, future or unknown past releases of hazardous substances could subject us to private lawsuits claiming damages, including for bodily injury or property damage, and to adverse publicity, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Liabilities, including legal costs, related to remediation of contaminated properties are not recognized by us until the related costs are considered probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nWe have noted a trend in public and private lawsuits filed on behalf of states, counties, cities and utilities alleging harm to the general public and the environment, including waterways and watersheds, as a result of the use of agricultural chemicals, such as fertilizers. If we become a party to any such lawsuits, we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us, which could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face increased climate-change-related litigation risk with respect to our operations. In particular, governmental and other entities in various U.S. states have filed lawsuits against companies in the coal, gas, oil and petroleum industries, alleging damages as a result of climate change, with the plaintiffs in such lawsuits seeking damages and abatement under various tort theories. Additionally, governmental and other entities are increasingly filing lawsuits or initiating regulatory action based on allegations that certain public statements regarding ESG-related matters and practices by companies are false or misleading greenwashing that violate deceptive trade practices and consumer protection statutes. Similar issues can also arise relating to aspirational statements such as net-zero or carbon neutrality targets that are made without an adequate basis to support such statements. Although we are not currently a party to any of these lawsuits, they present a high degree of uncertainty regarding the extent to which we face increased risk of liability stemming from climate change or ESG disclosures and practices.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Financing Our Business\nOur financial results are susceptible to seasonality.\nMany of our business activities are highly seasonal and operating results vary throughout the year. Our revenues generally trend lower during the second and fourth fiscal quarters and are highest during the first and third fiscal quarters. For example, in our Ag segment, our country operations business generally experiences higher volumes and revenues during the fall harvest and spring planting seasons and our agronomy business generally experiences higher volumes and revenues during the spring planting season. Our global grain and processing operations are subject to fluctuations in volume and revenues based on producer harvests, world grain prices and demand, and international trade relationships. Our Energy segment generally experiences higher volumes and revenues in certain operating areas, such as refined products, in the spring, summer and early fall when gasoline and diesel fuel use by agricultural producers is highest and is subject to global supply and demand forces. Other energy products, such as propane, generally experience higher volumes and revenues during the winter-heating and crop-drying seasons.\nIf any of our long-lived assets become impaired, we could be required to record a significant impairment charge, which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nAll our long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, goodwill, investments in unconsolidated affiliates and other identifiable intangibles, are evaluated for impairment in accordance with U.S. GAAP at least annually for goodwill and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The process of evaluating for impairment involves a number of judgments and estimates. If the judgments and estimates used in our analyses are not realized or change due to external factors, then actual results may not be consistent with these judgments and estimates, and our long-lived assets may become impaired in future periods. We have in the past, and may in the future, be required to write down the value of our long-lived assets. Any future impairment of our long-lived assets could require us to record a significant impairment charge, which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur business is capital-intensive and we rely on cash generated from our operations and external financing to fund our strategies and ongoing capital needs.\nWe require significant capital, including access to credit markets from time to time, to operate our businesses and fund our strategies. Our working capital requirements are directly affected by the price of commodities, which may fluctuate significantly and quickly. We also require substantial capital to maintain and upgrade our extensive network of facilities to keep pace with competitive developments, technological advances, regulatory changes and changing safety standards. In addition, the expansion of our business and pursuit of acquisitions or other business opportunities has required, and may in the future require, significant amounts of capital. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or maintain access to adequate external financing, including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets, it could restrict our current operations and our growth opportunities, which could adversely affect our operating results and restrict our ability to repay our existing debts.\nOur access to capital could be affected by financial institutions' and other capital sources' policies concerning energy-related businesses.\nPublic concern regarding the potential effects of climate change have directed increased attention toward the funding sources of energy-related businesses. As a result, some financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital have reduced or restricted lending to, or investing in, companies that operate in the energy industry. Limiting energy-related businesses' access to capital could make it more difficult for us to secure external financing, which could in turn restrict our current operations and growth opportunities, adversely affect our operating results and restrict our ability to repay our existing debts.\nOur cooperative structure limits our ability to access equity capital.\nAs a cooperative, we may not sell common stock in our company. In addition, existing laws and our articles of incorporation and bylaws limit dividends on any preferred stock we may issue to 8% per annum. These limitations may restrict our ability to raise equity capital and may adversely affect our ability to compete with enterprises that do not face similar restrictions. ITEM 1B.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management regarding our financial condition and results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Our MD&A is presented in the following sections:\nOverview\nBusiness Strategy\nFiscal 2023 Highlights\nFiscal 2024 Outlook\nOperating Metrics\nResults of Operations\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCritical Accounting Policies\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOur MD&A should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited financial statements and notes to those financial statements and the Cautionary Statement regarding forward-looking statements found in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nCHS Inc. is a diversified company that provides grain, food, agronomy and energy resources to businesses and consumers on a global scale. As a cooperative, we are owned by farmers, ranchers and member cooperatives across the United States. We also have preferred shareholders who own our five series of preferred stock, all of which are listed and traded on the Global Select Market of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. We operate in the following three reportable segments:\nEnergy. Produces and provides primarily for the wholesale distribution and transportation of petroleum products.\nAg. Purchases and further processes or resells grain and oilseed originated by our country operations and global grain and processing businesses, by our member cooperatives and by third parties. It also includes our renewable fuels business and serves as a wholesaler and retailer of agronomy products.\nNitrogen Production. Produces and distributes nitrogen fertilizer. It consists of our equity method investment in CF Nitrogen and allocated expenses.\nIn addition, our financing and hedging businesses, along with our nonconsolidated food production and distribution and wheat milling joint ventures, have been aggregated within our Corporate and Other category.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CHS and all subsidiaries and limited liability companies in which we have control. The effects of all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.\nCorporate administrative expenses and interest are allocated to each reportable segment and Corporate and Other, based on direct use of services, such as information technology and legal, and other factors or considerations relevant to the costs incurred.\nManagement's Focus. When evaluating our operating performance, management focuses on gross profit and income before income taxes (\"IBIT\"). As a company that operates heavily in global commodities, there is significant unpredictability and volatility in pricing, costs and global trade volumes. Consequently, we focus on managing the margin we can earn and the resulting IBIT. We also focus on ensuring balance sheet strength through appropriate management of financial liquidity, leverage, capital allocation and cash flow optimization.\nSeasonality. Many of our business activities are highly seasonal and our operating results vary throughout the year. Our revenues and IBIT generally trend lower during the second fiscal quarter and increase in the third fiscal quarter. For example, in our Ag segment, our country operations business generally experiences higher volumes and revenues during the fall harvest and spring planting seasons, which generally correspond to our first and third fiscal quarters, respectively. Additionally, our agronomy business generally experiences higher volumes and revenues during the spring planting season. Our global grain and processing operations are subject to fluctuations in volumes and revenues based on producer harvests, world grain prices, global demand and international trade relationships. Our Energy segment generally experiences higher volumes and revenues in\ncertain operating areas, such as refined products, in the spring, summer and early fall when gasoline and diesel fuel use by agricultural producers is highest and is subject to global supply and demand forces. Other energy products, such as propane, generally experience higher volumes and revenues during the winter heating and fall crop-drying seasons. The graphs below depict the seasonality inherent in our businesses.\nPricing and Volumes. Our revenues, assets and cash flows can be significantly affected by global market prices and sales volumes of commodities such as petroleum products, natural gas, grain, oilseed products and agronomy products. Changes in market prices for commodities we purchase without a corresponding change in the selling prices of those products can affect revenues and operating earnings. Similarly, increased or decreased sales volumes without a corresponding change in the purchase and selling prices of those products can affect revenues and operating earnings. Commodity prices and sales volumes are affected by a wide range of factors beyond our control, including weather, crop damage due to plant disease or insects, drought, availability/adequacy of supply of a commodity, availability of reliable rail and river transportation networks, disease outbreaks, government regulations and policies, global trade disputes, wars and civil unrest, and general political and/or economic conditions.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur business strategies focus on an enterprisewide effort to create an experience that empowers customers to make CHS their first choice, expand market access to add value for our owners and transform and evolve our core businesses by capitalizing on changing market dynamics. To execute these strategies, we are focused on implementing agile, efficient and sustainable technology platforms; building robust and efficient supply chains; hiring, developing and retaining high-performing, diverse and passionate teams; achieving operational excellence and continuous improvement; and maintaining a strong balance sheet.\nFiscal 2023 Highlights\nRobust global demand and market volatility continued to result in higher commodity prices that are elevated from historical averages.\nOur Energy segment delivered strong earnings as a result of favorable market conditions in our refined fuels business, including sustained high global demand for energy products, as consumption outpaced supply.\nIn our Ag segment, strong meal and oil demand resulted in improved crush margins that contributed to higher earnings in our oilseed processing business, which was partially offset by decreased prices for agronomy products.\nEquity method investments performed well, with our CF Nitrogen and Ventura Foods investments being the largest contributors.\nFiscal 2024 Outlook\nOur segments operate in cyclical environments in which market conditions can change rapidly with significant positive or negative impacts on our results. We anticipate that various macroeconomic factors will continue to drive uncertainty and instability in global energy and agricultural commodity markets, as well as global financial markets, which could have a significant impact on each of our segments during fiscal 2024. These factors include the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and escalation of conflict in the Middle East, shifts in global trade flows for commodities, a higher interest rate environment, and inflationary pressures increasing costs of labor, freight and materials. In addition to these broad macroeconomic factors, other factors could impact the demand and pricing for agricultural inputs and outputs, as well as our ability to supply those inputs and outputs while remaining profitable. These include the cost of renewable energy credits, the prices of which remains volatile and could continue to negatively impact our profitability, and regional factors, such as unpredictable weather conditions, including those due to climate change. We currently expect the imbalance between global supply and strong global demand for energy and agricultural commodities to continue to moderate in fiscal 2024. We are unable to predict how long the current environment will last or the severity of the financial and operational impacts in fiscal 2024. Refer to Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional consideration these risks may have on our business operations and financial performance.\nWe will continue to execute our enterprise priorities for fiscal 2024, including empowering and investing in our people, accelerating our operating model to better serve owners and customers, leveraging our financial strength to navigate dynamic and changing market conditions, and elevating sustainable growth through empowered teams, an integrated operating model and a solid financial foundation.\nOperating Metrics\nEnergy\nOur Energy segment operations primarily include our refineries in Laurel, Montana, and McPherson, Kansas, which process crude oil to produce refined products, including gasoline, distillates and other products. To ensure the reliability of our refineries, we perform major maintenance activities every two to five years, which require a temporary shutdown of operations. These planned shutdowns allow us to extend the life, increase the capacity and improve the safety and efficiency of our refinery processing assets. They also minimize unplanned business interruptions and are essential to the long-term reliability and profitability of our Energy segment.\nDuring periods of maintenance, utilization rates, throughput volumes and refined fuel yields are lower, and we may purchase refined petroleum products from third parties to meet the needs of our customers. These third-party purchases may result in lower margins than for products produced by our refineries, which reduces our profitability. The following table provides information about our consolidated refinery operations:\nYears Ended August 31,\n2023 2022\nRefinery throughput volumes* (Barrels per day)\nHeavy, high-sulfur crude oil 94,692 103,525\nAll other crude oil 70,397 73,171\nOther feedstocks and blendstocks 11,804 14,179\nTotal refinery throughput volumes 176,893 190,875\nRefined fuel yields\nGasolines 81,006 89,084\nDistillates 76,613 82,291\n*Lower refinery throughput volumes and refined fuel yields experienced during fiscal 2023 are primarily due to a planned shutdown to perform major\nmaintenance at our Laurel, Montana, refinery during the third quarter of fiscal 2023.\nWe are subject to the Renewable Fuel Standard that requires refiners to blend renewable fuels (e.g., ethanol and biodiesel) into their finished transportation fuels or purchase renewable energy credits, known as renewable identification numbers (\"RINs\"), in lieu of blending. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") generally establishes new annual renewable fuel percentage standards for each compliance year in the preceding year. In June 2023, the EPA issued a final renewable volume obligation (\"RVO\") for calendar years 2020 through 2025. We generate RINs through our blending activities, but we cannot generate enough RINs to meet the needs of our refining capacity; therefore, RINs must be purchased on the open market. The price of RINs can be volatile, with prices for D6 ethanol RINs and D4 ethanol RINs rising by 22% and 5%, respectively, during fiscal 2023 compared to the prior year, which negatively impacted our earnings. Estimates of our RIN expenses are calculated using an average RIN price each month.\nIn addition to our internal operational reliability, the profitability of our Energy segment is largely driven by crack spreads (i.e., the price differential between refined products and inputs such as crude oil) and Western Canadian Select (\"WCS\") crude oil discounts (i.e., the price discount for WCS crude oil relative to West Texas Intermediate (\"WTI\") crude oil), which are driven by supply and demand of refined products. Crack spreads and WCS crude oil discounts both increased in fiscal 2023, compared to the prior year, contributing to improved IBIT for the Energy segment. The table below provides information about average market reference prices and differentials that impacted our Energy segment:\nYears Ended August 31,\n2023 2022\nMarket indicators\nWTI crude oil (dollars per barrel) $ 78.25 $ 91.84\nWTI - WCS crude oil discount (dollars per barrel) $ 19.94 $ 14.93\nGroup 3 2:1:1 crack spread (dollars per barrel)* $ 36.17 $ 30.67\nGroup 3 5:3:2 crack spread (dollars per barrel)* $ 34.25 $ 29.02\nD6 ethanol RIN (dollars per RIN) $ 1.5725 $ 1.2859\nD4 ethanol RIN (dollars per RIN) $ 1.6380 $ 1.5560\n*Group 3 refers to the oil refining and distribution system serving the Midwest markets from the Gulf Coast through the Plains states.\nAg\nOur Ag segment operations work together to facilitate the production, purchase, sale and eventual use of grain and other agricultural commodities within the United States and internationally. Profitability in our Ag segment is largely driven by throughput and production volumes, as well as commodity price spreads; however, revenues and cost of goods sold (\"COGS\") are largely affected by market-driven commodity prices outside our control. The table below provides information about average market prices for agricultural commodities and our sales/throughput volumes that impacted our Ag segment for the years ended August 31, 2023 and 2022:\nYears Ended August 31,\nMarket Source* 2023 2022\nCommodity prices\nCorn (dollars per bushel) Chicago Board of Trade $ 6.19 $ 6.45\nSoybeans (dollars per bushel) Chicago Board of Trade $ 14.50 $ 14.65\nWheat (dollars per bushel) Chicago Board of Trade $ 7.17 $ 8.63\nUrea (dollars per ton) Green Markets NOLA $ 420.06 $ 644.93\nUrea ammonium nitrate (dollars per ton) Green Markets NOLA $ 349.87 $ 521.28\nEthanol (dollars per gallon) Chicago Platts $ 2.36 $ 2.62\nVolumes\nGrain and oilseed (thousands of bushels) 2,108,183 2,247,254\nNorth American grain and oilseed port throughput (thousands of bushels) 557,414 674,350\nWholesale crop nutrients (thousands of tons) 6,628 6,589\nEthanol (thousands of gallons) 968,516 915,087\n*Market source information represents the average month-end price during the period.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nYears Ended August 31,\n2023 2022\nDollars % of Revenues* Dollars % of Revenues*\n(In thousands) (In thousands)\nRevenues $ 45,590,004 100.0 % $ 47,791,666 100.0 %\nCost of goods sold 43,213,739 94.8 45,664,745 95.5\nGross profit 2,376,265 5.2 2,126,921 4.5\nMarketing, general and administrative expenses 1,032,765 2.3 997,835 2.1\nOperating earnings 1,343,500 2.9 1,129,086 2.4\nInterest expense 137,442 0.3 114,156 0.2\nOther income (112,131) (0.2) (23,760) -\nEquity income from investments (689,590) (1.5) (771,327) (1.6)\nIncome before income taxes 2,007,779 4.4 1,810,017 3.8\nIncome tax expense 107,655 0.2 132,116 0.3\nNet income 1,900,124 4.2 1,677,901 3.5\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests (314) - (861) -\nNet income attributable to CHS Inc. $ 1,900,438 4.2 % $ 1,678,762 3.5 %\n*Amounts less than 0.1% are shown as zero percent.

The following financial information is used when assessing our liquidity and capital resources to meet our capital allocation priorities, which include maintaining the safety and compliance of our operations, paying interest on debt and preferred stock dividends, returning cash to our member-owners in the form of cash patronage and equity redemptions and taking advantage of strategic opportunities that benefit our member-owners:\nAugust 31,\n2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,765,286 $ 793,957\nNotes payable 547,923 606,719\nLong-term debt including current maturities 1,827,658 1,958,814\nTotal equities 10,452,389 9,461,266\nWorking capital 3,229,455 2,425,878\nCurrent ratio* 1.5 1.3\n*Current ratio is defined as current assets divided by current liabilities.\nSummary of Our Major Sources of Cash and Cash Equivalents\nWe fund our current operations primarily through our cash flows from operations and with short-term borrowings through our committed and uncommitted revolving credit facilities, including our securitization facility with certain unaffiliated financial institutions (\"Securitization Facility\"). On April 21, 2023, we amended and restated our five-year unsecured revolving credit facility, which provides a committed amount of $2.8 billion. That facility now expires on April 21, 2028. We fund certain of our long-term capital needs, primarily those related to acquisitions of property, plant and equipment, with cash flows from operations and by issuing long-term debt. On January 24, 2023, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement to borrow $150.0 million of debt in the form of a note. The note matures on January 24, 2030, and interest accrues at a rate of 5.68%, subject to certain adjustments depending on our ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated cash flow, and the proceeds were used to retire maturing debt. See Note 9, Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements that are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our short-term borrowings and long-term debt, including tables with summarized long-term debt outstanding. We will continue to consider opportunities to further diversify and enhance our sources and amounts of liquidity.\nSummary of Our Major Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents\nAnnually, our Board of Directors approves our capital expenditure budget. Our fiscal 2024 capital expenditure priorities include maintaining our assets through repairs and maintenance; complying with environmental, health and safety requirements; enhancing information technology capabilities; improving productivity; and growth. Our refining business requires continued investment in our refining process to maintain its safety, operational reliability and profitability. In addition, our Board of Directors annually approves our cash patronage and equity redemptions to be paid in fiscal 2024, based on fiscal 2023 financial performance. The following is a summary of our primary cash requirements for fiscal 2024:\nCapital expenditures. We expect total capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 to be approximately $945.2 million, compared to capital expenditures of $564.5 million in fiscal 2023. Increased capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 are for investments in our infrastructure to meet the evolving needs of our owners and customers, enhance value for the cooperative system and propel sustainable growth.\nMajor maintenance. We expect total major maintenance for fiscal 2024 to be approximately $31.0 million, compared to major maintenance of $217.4 million in fiscal 2023. Decreased major maintenance for fiscal 2024 is due to significantly reduced turnaround activities at our refineries compared to the turnaround at our Laurel refinery during fiscal 2023.\nPreferred stock dividends. We had approximately $2.3 billion of preferred stock outstanding as of August 31, 2023. We expect to pay dividends on our preferred stock of approximately $170.2 million during fiscal 2024.\nPatronage. Our Board of Directors authorized approximately $365.0 million of our fiscal 2023 patronage-sourced earnings to be paid to our member-owners during fiscal 2024.\nEquity redemptions. Our Board of Directors has authorized equity redemptions of up to $365.0 million to be distributed in fiscal 2024 in the form of redemptions of qualified and nonqualified equity owned by individual producer-members and association members. The Board of Directors will continue to periodically evaluate the level of equity redemption activity throughout fiscal 2024 with respect to the amounts it has authorized for redemption during the fiscal year.\nWe believe cash generated by operating and investing activities, along with available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to support our short-term and long-term operations. Our notes payable and long-term debt are subject to various restrictive requirements for maintenance of minimum consolidated net worth and other financial ratios. We were in compliance with all our debt covenants and restrictions as of August 31, 2023. Based on our current 2024 projections, we expect continued covenant compliance.\nWorking Capital\nWe measure working capital as current assets less current liabilities as each amount appears on our consolidated balance sheets. We believe this information is meaningful to investors as a measure of operational efficiency and short-term financial health. Working capital is not defined under U.S. GAAP and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. Working capital as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, was as follows:\n2023 2022 Change\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCurrent assets $ 9,128,649 $ 9,377,847 $ (249,198)\nLess current liabilities 5,899,194 6,951,969 (1,052,775)\nWorking capital $ 3,229,455 $ 2,425,878 $ 803,577\nAs of August 31, 2023, working capital increased by $803.6 million compared with August 31, 2022. Current asset balance changes decreased working capital by $249.2 million, primarily due to decreases in receivables and inventories, which were driven by lower commodity prices and volumes. Current liabilities balance changes increased working capital by $1.1 billion, primarily due to a decrease in the current portion of long-term debt due to lower scheduled debt maturities in fiscal 2024, as well as decreases in customer advance payments and accounts payable due to lower commodity prices and volumes.\nWe finance our working capital needs through committed and uncommitted lines of credit with domestic and international banks. We believe our current cash balances and available capacity on our committed and uncommitted lines of credit will provide adequate liquidity to meet our working capital needs.\nContractual Obligations\nOur estimated future obligations as of August 31, 2023, include both current and long-term obligations. During fiscal 2024, we have a current obligation to repay $1.1 million of long-term debt, as well as $88.3 million of interest related to long-term debt. Beyond fiscal 2024, our long-term debt obligation is $1.8 billion and interest payments related to long-term debt of $367.5 million. For finance leases, we have a current and long-term obligation of $8.5 million and $50.6 million, respectively. For operating leases, we have a current and long-term obligation of $70.4 million and $228.4 million, respectively. See Note 9, Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt, and Note 19, Leases, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements that are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our long-term debt and leases, respectively. We enter into purchase obligations that are legally binding and into enforceable agreements to purchase goods or services that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and fixed or estimated prices to be paid at the time of settlement. Our current and long-term obligation for such arrangements is $6.9 billion and $847.7 million, respectively.\nCash Flows\nYears Ended August 31,\n2023 2022 Change\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 3,284,182 $ 1,946,518 $ 1,337,664\nNet cash used in investing activities (950,191) (457,084) (493,107)\nNet cash used in financing activities (1,395,468) (1,113,688) (281,780)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 2,590 (14,756) 17,346\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 941,113 $ 360,990 $ 580,123\nCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of various factors, including seasonality and timing differences associated with purchases, sales, taxes and other business decisions. The $1.3 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2023 primarily reflects decreases in receivables and inventories, which resulted from a combination of reduced prices and volumes, as well as increased net income during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022.\nThe $493.1 million increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2023 reflects larger expenditures for property, plant and equipment and major maintenance during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022.\nThe $281.8 million increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2023 primarily reflects increased cash outflows for patronage paid and equity redemptions during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires use of estimates, as well as management's judgments and assumptions regarding matters that are subjective, uncertain or involve a high degree of complexity, all of which affect the results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented. We believe the following accounting policies are critical to our consolidated financial statements and may involve a higher degree of estimates, judgments and complexity.\nInventory Valuation and Reserves\nGrain, processed grain, oilseed, processed oilseed and other minimally processed soy-based inventories are stated at net realizable value. All other inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The costs of certain energy inventories (wholesale refined products, crude oil and asphalt) are determined on the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") method; all other inventories of nongrain products purchased for resale are valued on the first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") and average cost methods. Estimates are used in determining the net realizable values of grain and oilseed and processed grain and oilseed inventories. These estimates include using inputs that are generally based on exchange-traded prices and/or recent market bids and offers, including location-specific adjustments. If estimates regarding the valuation of inventories are less favorable than management's assumptions, write-downs of inventories may be required.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe enter into exchange-traded commodity futures and options contracts to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on energy, grain and oilseed transactions to the extent considered practicable for minimizing risk. Futures and options contracts used for hedging are purchased and sold through regulated commodity exchanges. We also use over-the-counter instruments to hedge our exposure on fixed-price contracts. Fluctuations in inventory valuations, however, may not be completely hedged due in part to the absence of satisfactory hedging facilities for certain commodities and geographical areas and in part to our assessment of our exposure from expected price fluctuations. We also manage our risks by entering into fixed-price purchase contracts with preapproved producers and establishing appropriate limits for individual suppliers. Fixed-price sales contracts are entered into with customers of acceptable creditworthiness, as internally evaluated. The fair values of futures and options contracts are determined primarily from quotes listed on regulated commodity exchanges. Fixed-price purchase and sales contracts are with various counterparties, and the fair values of such contracts are determined from the market price of the underlying product. We are exposed to loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the contracts and, therefore, contract values are reviewed and adjusted to reflect potential nonperformance. Risk of nonperformance by counterparties includes the inability to perform because of a counterparty's financial condition and a risk that the counterparty will refuse to perform on a contract during periods of price fluctuations where contract prices are significantly different from the current market prices.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nPension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations depend on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, interest costs, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates and other factors. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expenses and the recorded obligations in future periods. While our management believes the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expenses.\nDeferred Tax Assets and Uncertain Tax Positions\nWe assess whether a valuation allowance is necessary to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered future taxable income, as well as other factors, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to our deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. We are also significantly impacted by utilization of tax credits, some of which were passed to us from the McPherson refinery, related to refinery upgrades that enable us to produce ultra-low-sulfur fuels. Our tax credit carryforwards are available to offset future federal and state tax liabilities with the tax credits becoming unavailable to us if not used by their expiration date. Our net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes are available to offset future taxable income. If our loss carryforwards are not used, they will expire.\nTax benefits related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in our financial statements if it is more likely than not the position would be sustained upon examination by a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The benefits are measured using a cumulative probability approach. Under this approach, we record in our financial statements the greatest amount of tax benefits that have a more than 50% probability of being realized upon final settlement with the tax authorities. In determining these tax benefits, we assign probabilities to a range of outcomes that we feel we could ultimately settle on with the tax authorities using all relevant facts and information available at the reporting date. Due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a benefit that is materially different than our current estimate.\nLong-Lived Assets\nProperty, plant and equipment is depreciated or amortized over the expected useful lives of individual or groups of assets based on the straight-line method. Economic circumstances or other factors may cause management's estimates of expected useful lives to differ from actual useful lives.\nAll long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, goodwill, investments in unconsolidated affiliates and other identifiable intangibles, are evaluated for impairment in accordance with U.S. GAAP, at least annually for goodwill, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group may not be recoverable. For goodwill, our annual impairment testing occurs in our fourth quarter. An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on the best information available. Fair value is generally measured by discounting estimated future\ncash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows and our estimates may differ from actual results.\nWe have asset retirement obligations with respect to certain of our refineries and other assets due to various legal obligations to clean and/or dispose of the component parts at the time they are retired. In most cases, these assets can be used for extended and indeterminate periods of time, as long as they are properly maintained and/or upgraded. It is our practice and current intent to maintain refineries and related assets and to continue making improvements to those assets based on technological advances. As a result, we believe our refineries and related assets have indeterminate lives for purposes of estimating asset retirement obligations because dates or ranges of dates upon which we would retire a refinery and related assets cannot reasonably be estimated at this time. When a date or range of dates can reasonably be estimated for the retirement of any component part of a refinery or other asset, we will estimate the cost of performing the retirement activities and record a liability for the fair value of that future cost.\nWe have other assets that we may be obligated to dismantle at the end of corresponding lease terms subject to the lessor's discretion for which we have recorded asset retirement obligations. Based on our estimates of the timing, cost and probability of removal, these obligations are not material.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nNo recent accounting pronouncements are expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nCommodity Price Risk\nWhen we enter into a commodity purchase or sales commitment, we incur risks related to price changes and performance including delivery, quality, quantity and shipment period. In the event that market prices decrease, we are exposed to risk of loss for the market value of inventory and purchase contracts with fixed or partially fixed prices. Conversely, we are exposed to risk of loss on our fixed- or partially fixed-price sales contracts in the event that market prices increase.\nOur use of hedging reduces exposure to price volatility by protecting against adverse short-term price movements but also limits the benefits of favorable short-term price movements. To reduce the price risk associated with fixed-price commitments, we generally enter into commodity derivative contracts, to the extent practical, to achieve a net commodity position within the formal position limits we have established and deemed prudent for each commodity. These contracts are primarily transacted through our FCM on regulated commodity futures exchanges, but may include over-the-counter derivative instruments when deemed appropriate. These contracts are recorded at fair values based on quotes listed on regulated commodity exchanges or the market prices of the underlying products listed on the exchanges, except that certain contracts are accounted for as normal purchase and normal sales transactions. For commodities where there is no liquid derivative contract, risk is managed through the use of forward sales contracts, other pricing arrangements and, to some extent, futures contracts in highly correlated commodities. These contracts are economic hedges of price risk, but are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. Unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in cost of goods sold in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nWhen a futures position is established, the initial margin must be deposited with the applicable exchange or broker. The amount of margin required varies by commodity and is set by the applicable exchange at its sole discretion. If the market price relative to a short futures position increases, an additional margin deposit would be required. Similarly, a margin deposit would be required if the market price relative to a long futures position decreases. Conversely, if the market price increases relative to a long futures position or decreases relative to a short futures position, margin deposits may be returned by the applicable exchange or broker.\nOur policy is to manage our commodity price risk exposure according to internal policies and in alignment with our tolerance for risk. It is our policy that our profitability should come from operations, primarily derived from margins on products sold and grain merchandised, not from hedging transactions. At any one time, inventory and purchase contracts for delivery to us may be substantial. We have risk management policies and procedures that include established net physical position limits. These limits are defined for each commodity and business unit, and business units may include both trader and management limits as appropriate. The limits policy is overseen at a high level by our corporate middle office and compliance team, with day-to-day monitoring procedures being implemented within each individual business unit to ensure any limits overages are explained and exposures reduced, or a temporary limit increase is established if needed. The position limits are\nreviewed at least annually with our senior leadership and the Board of Directors. We monitor current market conditions and may expand or reduce our net position limits or procedures in response to changes in those conditions.\nThe use of hedging instruments does not protect against nonperformance by counterparties to cash contracts. We evaluate counterparty exposure by reviewing contracts and adjusting the values to reflect potential nonperformance. Risk of nonperformance by counterparties includes the inability to perform because of a counterparty's financial condition and the risk that the counterparty will refuse to perform on a contract during periods of price fluctuations where contract prices are significantly different from current market prices. We manage these risks by entering into fixed-price purchase and sales contracts with preapproved producers and by establishing appropriate limits for individual suppliers. Fixed-price contracts are entered into with customers of acceptable creditworthiness, as internally evaluated. Regarding our use of derivatives, we transact in exchange traded instruments or enter into over-the-counter derivatives that primarily clear through our FCM, which limits our counterparty exposure relative to hedging activities. Historically, we have not experienced significant events of nonperformance on open contracts. Accordingly, we only adjust the estimated fair values of specifically identified contracts for nonperformance. Although we have established policies and procedures, we make no assurances that historical nonperformance experience will carry forward to future periods.\nBased on our net fair market value calculation as of August 31, 2023, a 10% adverse change in market prices would not materially affect our results of operations. While we use commodity futures and forward contracts as economic hedges of price risk and our operations have effective economic hedging requirements as a general practice, we cannot ensure that these risk management activities will offset all financial impact resulting from an adverse change in market prices. Factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging activities include the accuracy of our forecasts, volatility of the commodity markets and availability of hedging instruments. Utilization of derivatives and hedging activities is described more fully in Note 15, Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities, and Note 16, Fair Value Measurements, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInterest Rate Risk\nDebt used to finance our working capital needs is represented by short-term notes payable, so our blended interest rate for all such notes approximates current market rates. The table below provides information about our outstanding debt that is sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table presents scheduled contractual principal payments and related weighted average interest rates for the fiscal years presented.\nExpected Maturity Date Total Fair Value\nLiability\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter\n(Dollars in thousands)\nLiabilities:\nVariable rate miscellaneous\nshort-term notes payable $ 375,932 $ - $ - $ - $ - $ - $ 375,932 $ 375,932\nAverage interest rate 5.4 % - - - - - 5.4 % -\nVariable rate CHS Capital short-term notes payable $ 171,991 $ - $ - $ - $ - $ - $ 171,991 $ 171,991\nAverage interest rate 4.2 % - - - - - 4.2 % -\nFixed rate long-term debt $ 1,060 $ 330,187 $ 80,020 $ 58,021 $ 190,000 $ 755,000 $ 1,414,288 $ 1,290,308\nAverage interest rate 6.7 % 4.2 % 4.8 % 4.7 % 4.0 % 4.2 % 4.2 % -\nVariable rate long-term debt $ - $ - $ 366,000 $ - $ - $ - $ 366,000 $ 348,436\nAverage interest rate (a)\n- - 6.9 % - - - 6.9 % -\n(a) Borrowings are variable under the agreement and bear interest at a base rate plus an applicable margin.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe were exposed to risk regarding foreign currency fluctuations during fiscal 2023 and in prior years even though a substantial amount of our international sales were denominated in U.S. dollars. In addition to specific transactional exposure, foreign currency fluctuations can impact the ability of foreign buyers to purchase U.S. agricultural products and the competitiveness of U.S. agricultural products compared to the same products offered by alternative sources of world supply. From time to time, we enter into foreign currency hedge contracts to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations on our transactional exposures. The notional amount of our foreign exchange derivative contracts was $1.9 billion as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nThe financial statements listed in Item 15(a)(1) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are set forth beginning on page. Financial statement schedules are included in Schedule II in Item 15(a)(2) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\"Exchange Act\")), as of August 31, 2023. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of that date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.\nOur internal control system is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projecting any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on management's assessment using this framework, management concluded that, as of August 31, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to the Financial Reform Bill passed in July 2010 that permits us to provide only management's report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended August 31, 2023, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nOn November 7, 2023, we and Mr. Debertin entered into another amendment to the Employment Agreement (\"Employment Agreement Amendment No. 4\"), in order to, among other things, recognize his outstanding performance and long tenure and to further emphasize performance-based incentive award opportunities that can be earned for long term strategy execution as reflected in our results relative to goals set at the start of the multi-year performance period, pursuant to which:\nDuring the 2024-2026 ELTIP performance period (and any ELTIP performance period thereafter), Mr. Debertin will be entitled to a target ELTIP award opportunity of 5 times his average annual base salary over each three-year performance period applicable to that award opportunity, with a threshold ELTIP award opportunity equal to one-half of the target ELTIP award opportunity and a maximum ELTIP award opportunity equal to twice the target ELTIP award opportunity. Prior to the execution of Employment Agreement Amendment No. 4, the Employment Agreement (as amended) provided Mr. Debertin with a target ELTIP award opportunity of 3 times his average annual base salary over each three-year performance period applicable to that award opportunity with a maximum ELTIP award opportunity equal to two times his target ELTIP award opportunity; and\nDuring the fiscal year 2024-2026 ELTIP performance period (and any ELTIP performance period thereafter), if Mr. Debertin's employment ends due to death or permanent disability (as defined in our ELTIP) or if he is employed for at least 6 months of such a performance period and his employment ends due to retirement approved (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) by our Board of Directors, then upon completion and certification of performance results for such performance period, he will be eligible for a vested full grant participation in the applicable ELTIP award with the payout factor calculated at the same time as other participants.\nThe foregoing description of the Employment Agreement Amendment No. 4 does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Employment Agreement Amendment No. 4, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1D to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.\nITEM 9C.

Such executive officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners are required by the regulations of the SEC to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file.\nBased solely upon a review of copies of reports on Forms 3 and 4 and amendments thereto filed electronically with the SEC during, and reports on Form 5 and amendments thereto filed electronically with the SEC with respect to the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023, and based further upon written representations received by us with respect to the need to file reports on Form 5, except for Mr. Black, who filed one late Form 5 in January 2023 relating to his sale of preferred stock, no persons filed late reports required by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act during fiscal 2023.\nCODE OF ETHICS\nWe have adopted a code of ethics within the meaning of Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC. This code of ethics applies to all of our directors, officers and employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer. This code of ethics is part of our broader CHS Code of Conduct, which is posted on our website. The internet address for our website is www.chsinc.com and the CHS Code of Conduct may be found on the \"Compliance and integrity\" web page, which can be accessed from the \"About CHS\" web page, which can be accessed from our main web page. We intend to disclose any amendment to, or waiver from, a provision of the code of ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer or principal accounting officer on the \"Compliance and integrity\" web page of our website. The information contained on our website is not part of, and is not incorporated in, this report or any other report we file with or furnish to the SEC.\nAUDIT COMMITTEE MATTERS\nThe Board of Directors has a separately designated standing Audit Committee for the purpose of overseeing our accounting and financial reporting processes and audits of our financial statements. In fiscal 2023, the Audit Committee was comprised of Mr. Beckman, Mr. Cordes (from August 31, 2022 until January 12, 2023), Mr. Erickson, Mr. Fritel and Mr. Meyer (chair), Mr. Stroh and Mr. Throener (from January 12, 2023 until present), each of whom was an independent director during their service on the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee has oversight responsibility to our member-owners relating to our financial statements and the financial reporting process, preparation of the financial reports and other financial information provided by us to any governmental or regulatory body, the systems of internal accounting and financial controls, the internal audit function and the annual independent audit of our financial statements. The Audit Committee assures that the corporate information gathering and reporting systems developed by management represent a good faith attempt to provide senior management and the Board of Directors with information regarding material acts, events and conditions within CHS. In addition, the Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the independent registered public accounting firm.\nWe do not believe any member of the Audit Committee is an \"audit committee financial expert\" as defined in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations thereunder. As a cooperative, members of our Board of Directors are nominated and elected by our members. To ensure geographic representation of our members, the Board of Directors represents eight regions in which our members are located. The voting members in each region nominate and elect the number of directors for that region as set forth in our bylaws. To be eligible for service as a director, a nominee must among other things, (i) be an active farmer or rancher, (ii) be a Class A individual member of CHS or member of a cooperative association and (iii) reside in the geographic region from which he or she is nominated. Neither management nor the incumbent directors have any control\nover the nominating process for directors. Because of the nomination procedure and the election process, we cannot ensure that an elected director serving on our Audit Committee will be an audit committee financial expert. However, many of our directors, including all of the Audit Committee members, are financially sophisticated and have experience or background in which they have had significant financial management or oversight responsibilities. The current Audit Committee includes directors who have served as presidents or chairs of local cooperative association boards. Members of the Board of Directors, including the Audit Committee, also operate large commercial enterprises requiring expertise in all areas of management, including financial oversight. ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\nExecutive Compensation\nOverview\nThis Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes the material elements of compensation awarded to each of the following executive officers (\"Named Executive Officers\") during the year ended August 31, 2023:\nName Position\nJay Debertin President and Chief Executive Officer\nOlivia Nelligan Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Strategy Officer\nBrandon Smith Executive Vice President, General Counsel\nDarin Hunhoff Executive Vice President, Energy\nJohn Griffith Executive Vice President, Ag Business and CHS Hedging\nCHS creates connections to empower agriculture for our producer and member cooperative owners and the communities in which we and our owners live and operate. Our compensation programs are aligned with our operational objectives and long-term business strategy and are designed to attract, reward and retain high-performing and diverse team members who are passionate about our mission and our members.\nThis section outlines the objectives and principles underlying our compensation and benefit programs, as well as our compensation decisions for the CEO and other Named Executive Officers. In this Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the related compensation tables and the accompanying narratives, all references to a given year refer to our fiscal year ending on August 31 of that year.\nCompensation Philosophy and Objectives\nThe Governance Committee of our Board of Directors (\"Governance Committee\") oversees the design and administration of our executive compensation and benefit programs. The primary principles and objectives in compensating our executive officers are to:\nAttract and retain exceptional talent who meet our leadership expectations and are engaged and committed to the long-term success of CHS by providing market-competitive compensation and benefit programs;\nAlign executive rewards to quantifiable annual and long-term performance goals that drive enterprise results and provide competitive returns to our member-owners;\nEmphasize pay for performance by providing a total direct compensation mix of fixed and variable pay that is primarily weighted on annual and long-term incentives to reward annual and sustained performance over the long term; and\nEnsure compliance with government mandates and regulations.\nGovernance of Executive Compensation\nOur executive compensation programs are designed to attract and retain top talent executives and to motivate them to optimize member-owner returns and to execute our long-term strategies. The executive compensation program utilizes a pay for performance approach to link each executive's total compensation to a combination of the company's short-term and long-term financial performance and achievement of individual performance objectives.\nThe Governance Committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its responsibilities regarding matters that relate to governing the organization, including reviewing and making recommendations to the Board with respect to the establishment, material modification to, or amendment of incentive, bonus or other similar compensation plans in which other Named Executive Officers are eligible participants. The Governance Committee and the Executive Committee of our Board of Directors (\"Executive Committee\") have engaged a third-party consultant, Pay Governance LLC, to advise on the short-term and long-term incentive pay plans applicable to our senior executives, including our other Named Executive Officers. Annually, the Governance Committee establishes incentive plan goals applicable to our other Named Executive Officers under the incentive compensation plans to which they and other employees are eligible.\nPay Governance, LLC provides guidance to the Executive Committee regarding market-competitive levels of base pay, short-term incentive pay, long-term incentive pay and the overall compensation package for our CEO. Data and analysis is shared with the Executive Committee, which considers the data and analysis as part of its review of the CEO's pay. The Executive Committee recommends to our Board of Directors pay actions relative to our CEO and approves annual and long-term incentive awards for our CEO based on company performance against the preestablished financial goals and, as applicable, individual performance. The Board of Directors makes final decisions regarding our CEO's base pay, short-term incentive pay and long-term incentive pay, as well as the allocation between these components. In turn, our Board of Directors communicates this pay information to our CEO. There are no formal policies for allocation between long-term and short-term compensation other than the intention to be competitive with the external compensation market for comparable positions and to be consistent with our compensation philosophy and objectives. Our CEO is not involved with the selection of the third-party consultant and does not participate in or observe Executive Committee meetings that concern CEO compensation matters.\nBased on a review of compensation market data provided by our human resources department (survey sources and methodology are explained below under \"Components of Executive Compensation and Benefits\"), with input from a third-party consultant if necessary, our CEO decides compensation levels for the other Named Executive Officers, recommends for the Board of Directors' approval the annual and long-term incentive financial performance goals applicable to the other Named Executive Officers (and other employees) and communicates base and incentive compensation to the other Named Executive Officers. The day-to-day design and administration of compensation and benefit plans are managed by our human resources, finance and legal departments.\nComponents of Executive Compensation and Benefits\nOur executive compensation and benefit program consists of seven components. Each component is designed to be competitive with the external market. In determining competitive compensation levels, we analyze independent compensation survey information, including comparable industries, markets, revenues and companies that compete with us for executive talent. In fiscal 2023, information from the following sources was considered:\nWillis Towers Watson General Industry Executive (U.S.)\nWillis Towers Watson Custom Peer Comparator Group Executive (U.S.; includes the portion of the 16 peer companies that elected to participate in the survey)\nUS Mercer Benchmark Database/Total Remuneration Survey (Executive)\nRadford/Aon Global Compensation Database (Executive)\nThe survey and database data included a range of competitive pay levels, including median market rates for base salary, short-term incentive, total cash compensation, long-term incentive and total direct compensation. Companies included in the surveys and databases vary by industry, revenue and number of employees, and represent both public and private ownership, as well as nonprofit, government and mutual organizations.\nIn determining competitive compensation levels for the CEO, various factors were considered including market data from surveys and publicly available proxy compensation data from a specific comparator group of peer companies, which included 16 private, public and cooperative organizations in the agronomy, energy, food and grain industries. Our Board annually reviews the peer group companies list and makes adjustments to the peer group companies list based on internal and external market data. The Board approved the following comparator group for 2023:\nComparator Group\nADM Conagra Brands Kinder Morgan Mosaic\nBunge Phillips 66 Koch Industries* Nutrien\nCF Industries General Mills Land O'Lakes* Valero Energy\nCargill* HF Sinclair Marathon Petroleum Williams Companies\n*While public disclosure of pay was not available, aggregate market data from surveys including these companies was considered.\nThe goal is to provide our executives with an overall total compensation package that is competitive in comparable industries, companies and markets. We target around market median compensation levels for base pay, target total cash and target total direct compensation, and around the 75th percentile for actual total direct compensation when above-market performance is achieved and below market median levels if performance is below market.\nFor fiscal 2023 for the Named Executive Officers excluding the CEO, base pay, on average, was slightly below the market median and total cash compensation and total direct compensation were above the market median on average. The total cash compensation, on average, was above the market median because actual earned short-term incentive awards were achieved\nat the maximum level of performance. The total direct compensation, on average, was above the market median because actual earned long-term incentive awards for the fiscal 2021-2023 performance period were achieved at the superior level of performance.\nFor fiscal 2023, the CEO's base pay and target total cash compensation were at the desired competitive range around market median for the achievement of target annual performance results. However, target total direct compensation was lower than the desired competitive range due to the target long-term incentive award being significantly below market median. With the strong performance this fiscal year, his actual total direct compensation was closer to the market median than the market 75th percentile (reflecting maximum payout under the long-term incentive but with a target award opportunity that was below market median).\nThe following table presents a detailed breakdown of each compensation element:\nPay Element Definition of Pay Element Purpose of Pay Element\nBase Pay Competitive base level of compensation provided relative to skills, experience, knowledge and contributions Provides the fundamental element of compensation for demonstrating core responsibilities of the job\nShort-Term Incentive Broad-based employee short-term performance-based variable pay incentive for achieving predetermined annual financial and individual performance goals Provides a direct link between pay and annual business objectives\nProvides pay for performance to motivate and encourage the achievement of critical business initiatives\nEncourages proper expense control and containment\nProfit-Sharing Selective employee short-term performance-based variable pay for achieving predetermined annual financial goals Provides a direct link between employee pay and our profitability\nLong-Term Incentive Long-term performance-based incentive for senior management to achieve predetermined triennial Return on Invested Capital (\"ROIC\") goals Provides a direct link between senior management pay and long-term strategic business objectives\nAligns management and member-owner interests\nEncourages retention of key management\nRetirement Benefits Retirement benefits under the qualified retirement plans are identical to broad-based retirement plans generally available to all full-time employees These benefits are a part of our broad-based employee total rewards program designed to attract and retain quality employees\nThe supplemental plans include nonqualified retirement benefits that restore qualified benefits contained in our broad-based plans for employees whose retirement benefits are limited by salary caps under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\"Internal Revenue Code\"); in addition, the plans allow participants to voluntarily defer receipt of a portion of their income These benefits are provided to attract and retain senior leaders with total rewards programs that are competitive with comparable companies\nHealth and Welfare Benefits Medical, dental, vision, life insurance and short-term disability benefits are generally available to all full-time employees. Certain officers, including our Named Executive Officers, also are eligible for executive long-term disability benefits With the exception of executive long-term disability benefits, these benefits are a part of our broad-based employee total rewards program designed to attract and retain quality employees\nAdditional Benefits Additional benefits are provided to certain officers, including our Named Executive Officers These benefits are provided as part of an overall total rewards package that strives to be competitive with comparable companies and retain key talent\nFiscal 2023 Executive Compensation Mix at Target\nThe objectives of our executive compensation program require a suitable mix of base pay, short-term incentive pay and long-term incentive pay that will drive the executive officers to achieve results that benefit our member-owners' interests over the long term while maintaining alignment with the competitive talent market.\nThe charts below illustrate the mix of base salary, short-term incentive target pay and long-term incentive target pay based on the 2023 Grants of Plan-Based Awards values (see table under Section 11.2) for our CEO and the other Named Executive Officers as a group.\nBase Pay\nBase salaries of our Named Executive Officers represent a fixed form of compensation paid on a semimonthly basis. The base salaries are generally set around the median level of market data collected through our benchmarking process against other equivalent positions of comparable companies. The individual's actual salary relative to the market median is based on a number of factors, which include, but are not limited to, scope of responsibilities, individual experience and performance.\nBase salaries for our Named Executive Officers are reviewed on an annual basis or at the time of significant changes in scope and level of responsibilities. Changes in base salaries are determined through review of competitive market data, as well as individual performance and contribution, internal equity and other factors. Changes are not governed by preestablished weighting factors or a specific merit matrix. Our CEO is responsible for this process for the other Named Executive Officers. The Executive Committee is responsible for this process for our CEO.\nMr. Debertin received a 4.0% base salary increase effective January 1, 2023. Our Board of Directors approved the increase to reward Mr. Debertin for strong performance and to maintain a competitive pay position to market. Ms. Nelligan, Mr. Smith, Mr. Hunhoff, and Mr. Griffith received base salary increases of 10%, 4%, 3.39% and 10.09%, respectively. The larger base salary increases for Ms. Nelligan and Mr. Griffith included both a merit increase and a market adjustment to improve competitive pay position to market.\nOverview of Performance-Based Incentive Plans\nWe operate our diversified global businesses to maximize value, in the near-term and long-term, for our member cooperatives, farmer-owners and customers. Our officer compensation program reflects this key objective by emphasizing performance-based incentive opportunities, through the AVP and ELTIP that are discussed in detail below, with awards earned commensurate with our results. The actual payouts for the incentive cycles ending in 2023 reflect the team's outstanding execution relative to our business strategy in key areas including revenues, earnings and capital management, which are, collectively, captured in our primary financial measure of ROIC. The AVP, which has a larger group of employees eligible to participate, rewards annual ROIC results and, for executives, the ELTIP rewards three-year ROIC results and requires an additional vesting period over 28 months for earned awards.\nShort-Term Incentive Pay\nNamed Executive Officers are covered by the same CHS Annual Variable Pay Plan (\"Annual Variable Pay Plan\" or \"AVP\") as other management and professional employees and, based on the plan provisions, when they are hired or retire they receive awards prorated to the period of time eligible. Each Named Executive Officer was eligible to participate in the AVP for the entirety of fiscal 2023. Target AVP award levels were set with reference to various factors including internal equity and competitive market compensation levels and were intended to motivate our executives by providing short-term incentive awards\nfor the achievement of predetermined annual goals. Our AVP incentive for fiscal 2023 was weighted 70% on enterprise-level financial performance and 30% on specific management business objectives.\nThe financial performance component was based on preestablished ROIC goals for CHS at the enterprise level. The threshold, target and maximum ROIC goals approved by the Board of Directors for fiscal 2023 are set forth in the table below.\nThe management business objectives were based on individual performance against specific goals relating to subjects such as business profitability, execution of strategic initiatives or talent acquisition, development and retention. In conjunction with the annual performance appraisal process for our CEO, our Board of Directors reviews the individual goals and, in turn, determines and approves this portion of the short-term incentive award based upon completion or partial completion of the previously specified goals and principal accountabilities for our CEO. Likewise, our CEO uses a similar process for determining individual goal attainment for the other Named Executive Officers.\nCHS financial performance goals and award opportunities under our fiscal 2023 Annual Variable Pay Plan were as follows:\nPerformance Level CHS ROIC Goal Target Award Multiple\nMaximum 9.0% 2.0x\nTarget 7.5% 1.0x\nThreshold 6.0% 0.5x\nBelow threshold <6.0% 0.0x\nROIC is not defined under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, it should not be considered a substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nROIC is a measurement of how efficiently we use capital and the level of returns on that capital. It is calculated by dividing net operating profit after tax by average funded debt plus beginning equity. We define adjusted net operating profit after tax as earnings before taxes plus interest, net, and the sum is multiplied by the effective tax rate. For purposes of the fiscal 2023 AVP, we define funded debt as the sum of the average of beginning and end of year funded debt, including the current portion thereof, plus any guarantees thereof, using balances as of July 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively, and the total beginning of year equity as of July 31, 2022, respectively.\nROIC results for fiscal year 2023 were 16.4%, resulting in award payouts at 2.0x target for the financial performance component. Robust global demand and market volatility continued to result in commodity prices that were elevated from historical averages. Adjusted net operating profit after tax increased in fiscal 2023, as our Energy segment delivered strong earnings with favorable market conditions in our refined fuels business and our Ag segment experienced strong meal and oil demand, resulting in improved oilseed crush margins that contributed to higher earnings. Mr. Debertin, the other Named Executive Officers, and our other CHS employees were able to consistently execute to meet the needs of our customers and member-owners. The CEO and each other Named Executive Officer's performance was determined by the Board of Directors or the CEO, respectively, to have been strong against their individual objectives, and therefore, each Named Executive Officer was awarded the maximum payout for the 30% individual goals component. Short-term incentive awards that were earned under the Annual Variable Pay Plan for fiscal 2023 for the Named Executive Officers are as follows:\nName Position 2023 AVP Awards\n(Dollars)\nJay Debertin President and Chief Executive Officer $ 4,096,800\nOlivia Nelligan Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Strategy Officer 1,518,000\nBrandon Smith Executive Vice President, General Counsel 1,404,380\nDarin Hunhoff Executive Vice President, Energy 1,403,920\nJohn Griffith Executive Vice President, Ag Business and CHS Hedging 1,380,000\nProfit-Sharing\nEach Named Executive Officer was eligible to participate in our Profit-Sharing Plan, which is also available to other employees. The purpose of the Profit-Sharing Plan is to provide a direct link between employee pay and our profitability. Annual profit-sharing contributions are calculated as a percent of base pay and annual variable pay (total earnings) and are made to the CHS Inc. 401(k) Plan (\"401(k) Plan\") account and CHS Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (\"Deferred Compensation Plan\") account of each Named Executive Officer. The levels of fiscal 2023 profit-sharing awards vary in relation to the level of CHS ROIC achieved and are displayed in the following table:\nROIC Profit-Sharing Award\n9.0% 5%\n8.3% 4%\n7.5% 3%\n6.8% 2%\n6.0% 1%\nROIC results for fiscal 2023 were 16.4%. Accordingly, each Named Executive Officer earned a 5% award under the Profit-Sharing Plan.\nLong-Term Incentive Pay\nEach Named Executive Officer was eligible to participate in the CHS Inc. Executive Long-Term Incentive Plan (\"ELTIP\"). The purpose of the ELTIP is to align long-term results with long-term performance goals, encourage our Named Executive Officers to maximize long-term value for our member-owners and retain key executives. The ELTIP consists of three-year performance periods to ensure consideration is made for our long-term financial performance and strategic execution, with a new performance period beginning every year. Our Board of Directors approves the ELTIP goals for each three-year period.\nEarned awards from the ELTIP are contributed to the Deferred Compensation Plan after the end of each performance period. These awards vest over an additional 28-month period following the performance period end date. The extended earning and vesting provisions of the ELTIP are designed to help us retain key executives. Participants who leave CHS prior to retirement for reasons other than death or disability forfeit all unearned and unvested ELTIP award balances. Participants who meet retirement criteria, die or become disabled receive prorated awards following the ELTIP rules. Like the Annual Variable Pay Plan, award levels for the ELTIP are set with regard to various factors including internal equity and market competitive considerations. The target level ELTIP award level was 1.15x base salary for Named Executive Officers other than Mr. Debertin for performance periods beginning before September 1, 2021 (including the three-year ELTIP performance period ending in fiscal 2023), and 1.25x base salary for performance periods beginning on or after September 1, 2021. Mr. Debertin's target ELTIP award level was 1.5x his base salary for performance periods beginning before September 1, 2021 (including the three-year ELTIP performance period ending in fiscal 2023), and 3.0x his base salary for performance periods beginning on or after September 1, 2021.\nFor the three-year ELTIP period ending in fiscal 2023, the ELTIP performance measure was ROIC. As stated above, ROIC is a measurement of how efficiently we use capital and the level of returns on that capital and is calculated by dividing adjusted net operating profit after tax by average funded debt plus total equity at the beginning of the year. For purposes of the fiscal 2021-2023 performance period, we define funded debt as the sum of the average of long-term debt at the beginning and end of the year, including the current portion thereof, plus any guarantees thereof, using balances as of July 31, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively, and the total beginning of year equity as of July 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively.\nAs also stated above, ROIC is not defined under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, it should not be considered a substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nAward opportunities for the fiscal 2021-2023 ELTIP are expressed as a multiple of a participant's average base salary as of August 31 for each of the three years in the performance period. We must meet a three-year period threshold level of ROIC performance for any participant to earn an award payout under the 2021-2023 ELTIP. As indicated in the table below, the threshold, target, maximum and superior performance maximum ROIC goals for the fiscal 2021-2023 performance period are as follows:\nPerformance Level CHS Three-Year ROIC Target Award Multiple\nSuperior performance maximum 7.5% 4.0x (1)/ 3.33x (2)\nMaximum 6.5% 2.0x\nTarget 5.5% 1.0x\nThreshold 4.1% 0.5x\nBelow threshold <4.1% 0.0x\n(1) For the Named Executive Officers other than the CEO, the superior performance level results in an award equivalent to 4.0x the target award.\n(2) For the CEO, the superior performance level results in an award equivalent to 3.33x the target award.\nBusiness conditions in the agriculture and energy industries were favorable and afforded us opportunities during the 2021-2023 performance period. Our ability to execute in this environment with strong operational performance resulted in ROIC of 6.2% during fiscal 2021, which was above the target performance level, and 16.1% and 16.4% in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, respectively, which was well above the superior performance maximum. Overall ROIC performance for the fiscal 2021-2023 performance period was 13.1%, resulting in superior performance level awards equivalent to 4.0x the target for Named Executive Officers other than the CEO and 3.33x the target for the CEO. ELTIP payments for the fiscal 2021-2023 ELTIP for the Named Executive Officers are as follows:\nName Position ELTIP Payments\n(Dollars)\nJay Debertin President and Chief Executive Officer $ 6,588,481\nOlivia Nelligan Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Strategy Officer 2,806,000\nBrandon Smith Executive Vice President, General Counsel 2,710,472\nDarin Hunhoff Executive Vice President, Energy 2,720,112\nJohn Griffith Executive Vice President, Ag Business and CHS Hedging 2,522,332\nThe fiscal 2023 award grant values associated with the fiscal 2023-2025 ELTIP performance period, which continue to measure three-year ROIC, are provided in the \"2023 Grants of Plan-Based Awards\" table.\nRetirement Benefits\nWe provide the following retirement and deferral programs to Named Executive Officers:\nCHS Inc. Pension Plan\nCHS Inc. 401(k) Plan\nCHS Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan\nCHS Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan\nCHS Inc. Pension Plan\nThe CHS Inc. Pension Plan (\"Pension Plan\") is a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan. All Named Executive Officers participate in the Pension Plan. A Named Executive Officer is fully vested in the Pension Plan after three years of vesting service. The Pension Plan provides for a lump sum payment of the participants account balance once the Named Executive Officer reaches normal retirement age (or, alternatively, for a monthly annuity for the Named Executive Officer's lifetime if elected by the Named Executive Officer). The normal form of benefit for a single Named Executive Officer is a life annuity and for a married Named Executive Officer the normal form of benefit is a 50% joint and survivor annuity. Other annuity forms are also available on an actuarial equivalent basis. Compensation and benefits are limited based on limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.\nA Named Executive Officer's benefit under the Pension Plan depends on pay credits to his or her account, which are based on the Named Executive Officer's total salary and annual variable pay for each year of employment, date of hire, age at\ndate of hire and the length of service, and investment credits, which are computed using the interest crediting rate and the Named Executive Officer's account balance at the beginning of the plan year.\nThe amount of pay credits added to a Named Executive Officer's account each year is a percentage of the Named Executive Officers base salary and annual variable pay plus compensation reduction pursuant to the 401(k) Plan and any pretax contribution to any of our welfare benefit plans, paid vacations, paid leaves of absence and pay received if away from work due to a sickness or injury. The pay credits percentage received is determined on a yearly basis, based on the years of benefit service completed as of December 31 of each year. A Named Executive Officer receives one year of benefit service for every calendar year of employment in which the Named Executive Officer completed at least 1,000 hours of service.\nPay credits are earned according to the following schedules:\nRegular Pay Credits\nRegular Pay Credit\nYears of Benefit Service Pay Below Social Security Taxable Wage Base Pay Above Social Security Taxable Wage Base\n1-3 years 3% 6%\n4-7 years 4% 8%\n8-11 years 5% 10%\n12-15 years 6% 12%\n16 years or more 7% 14%\nMid-Career Pay Credits\nEmployees hired after age 40 qualify for the following minimum pay credit:\nMinimum Pay Credit\nAge at Date of Hire Pay Below Social Security Taxable Wage Base Pay Above Social Security Taxable Wage Base\nAge 40-44 4% 8%\nAge 45-49 5% 10%\nAge 50 or higher 6% 12%\nInvestment Credits\nWe credit a Named Executive Officer's account at the end of the calendar year with an investment credit based on the balance at the beginning of the year. The investment credit is based on the average return for one-year Treasury bills for the four-month period from August 1 through November 30 of the prior year. The minimum interest rate under the Pension Plan is 4.65% and the maximum is 10%.\nCHS Inc. 401(k) Plan\nThe 401(k) Plan is a tax-qualified, defined contribution retirement plan. Most full-time, nonunion CHS employees are eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan, including each Named Executive Officer. Participants may contribute between 1% and 50% of their pay on a pretax basis. We match 100% of the first 1% and 50% of the next 5% of pay contributed each year (maximum 3.5%). Our Board of Directors may elect to reduce or eliminate matching contributions for any year or any portion thereof. Participants are 100% vested in their own contributions and are fully vested after two years of service in matching contributions made on the participants behalf by us.\nEligible participants are automatically enrolled in the plan at a 3% contribution rate and, effective each January 1, the participant's contribution will be automatically increased by 1%. This escalation will stop once the participant's contribution reaches 15%. The participant may elect to cancel or change these automatic contributions at any time.\nCHS Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and CHS Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan\nBecause the Internal Revenue Code limits the benefits that may be paid from the Pension Plan and the 401(k) Plan, the CHS Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (\"SERP\") and the Deferred Compensation Plan (\"DCP\") were established to provide certain employees participating in the qualified plans with supplemental benefits such that, in the aggregate, they equal the benefits they would have been entitled to receive under the qualified plan had these limits not been in effect. The SERP also includes compensation deferred under the DCP that is excluded under the qualified retirement plan. All Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in the SERP.\nCompensation includes total salary and annual variable pay without regard to limitations on compensation imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. Company contributions under the Pension Plan and 401(k) Plan are not eligible for pay credits.\nCertain Named Executive Officers may have accumulated nonqualified plan balances or benefits that have been carried over from predecessor companies as a result of past mergers and acquisitions. Benefits from the SERP are primarily funded in a rabbi trust, with a balance as of August 31, 2023, of $34.2 million. Benefits from the plan do not qualify for special tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code.\nThe DCP allows eligible Named Executive Officers to voluntarily defer receipt of up to 75% of their base salary and up to 100% of their annual variable pay. The election must occur prior to the beginning of the calendar year in which the compensation will be paid. During the year ended August 31, 2023, all of the Named Executive Officers were eligible to participate in the DCP. Mr. Debertin, Ms. Nelligan and Mr. Griffith participated in the elective portion of the DCP.\nBenefits from the DCP are primarily funded in a rabbi trust, with a balance as of August 31, 2023, of $144.1 million. Benefits from the plan do not qualify for special tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code.\nHealth and Welfare Benefits\nLike our other employees, each of the Named Executive Officers is entitled to receive benefits under our comprehensive health and welfare program. Like nonexecutive full-time employees, participation in the individual benefit plans is based on each Named Executive Officer's annual benefit elections and varies by individual.\nMedical Plans\nNamed Executive Officers and their dependents may participate in our medical plan on the same basis as other eligible full-time employees. The plan provides each Named Executive Officer an opportunity to choose a level of coverage and coverage options with varying deductibles and copays to pay for hospitalization, physician and prescription drug expenses. The cost of this coverage is shared by us and the covered Named Executive Officer.\nDental and Vision Plan\nNamed Executive Officers and their dependents may participate in our dental and vision plan on the same basis as other eligible full-time employees. The plan provides coverage for basic dental and vision expenses. The cost of this coverage is shared by us and the covered Named Executive Officer.\nLife, AD&D and Dependent Life Insurance\nNamed Executive Officers and their dependents may participate in our basic life, optional life, accidental death and dismemberment (\"AD&D\") and dependent life plans on the same basis as other eligible full-time employees. The plans allow Named Executive Officers an opportunity to purchase group life insurance on the same basis as other eligible full-time employees. Basic life insurance equal to one times eligible compensation will be provided at our expense on the same basis as other eligible full-time employees. Named Executive Officers can choose various coverage levels of optional and dependent life insurance at their own expense on the same basis as other eligible full-time employees. Employee optional life coverage includes an equal amount of AD&D coverage. We also provide at our expense Business Travel Accident coverage to Named Executive Officers when partaking in a business trip that furthers the business of CHS.\nShort-Term, Long-Term and Individual Disability\nNamed Executive Officers participate in our Short-Term Disability Plan (\"STD\") on the same basis as other eligible full-time employees. The Named Executive Officers also participate in an executive Long-Term Disability Plan (\"LTD\") and\nIndividual Disability Insurance (\"IDI\"). These programs replace a portion of income in the event that a Named Executive Officer is disabled under the applicable terms and is unable to work full-time. The cost of STD, LTD and IDI coverage is paid by us.\nFlexible Spending Accounts/Health Savings Accounts\nNamed Executive Officers may participate in our Flexible Spending Account (\"FSA\") or Health Savings Account (\"HSA\") on the same basis as other eligible full-time employees. The FSA and HSA provide Named Executive Officers an opportunity to pay for certain eligible medical expenses on a pretax basis. Contributions to the FSA and HSA are made by the Named Executive Officer.\nTravel Assistance Program and Identity Theft Protection\nLike other nonexecutive full-time employees, each of the Named Executive Officers is covered by our travel assistance program and identity theft protection program. The travel assistance program provides AD&D protection should a covered injury or death occur while on a business trip. The identity theft protection program provides credit monitoring and restoration services to protect against identity theft.\nAdditional Benefits\nCertain benefits such as executive physical examinations and limited financial and tax planning assistance are available to our Named Executive Officers. These are provided as part of an overall total rewards package that strives to be competitive with comparable companies and retain individuals who are critical to us. More details can be found in the \"All Other Compensation\" section of the Summary Compensation Table.\nIncentive Compensation Recovery Policy\nOn September 6, 2023, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to our Incentive Compensation Recovery Policy (\"Recovery Policy\") effective as of December 1, 2023. The purpose of the amendment to the Recovery Policy was to bring the Recovery Policy into compliance with newly adopted Listing Rule 5608 by The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC and to provide general updates to the policy to reflect what we believe are best practices. Specifically, the Recovery Policy applies to our current and former directors, employees, and employees who are or were identified by us as an \"officer\" which for purposes of the Recovery Policy includes any person that performs policy-making functions for CHS or any subsidiary of CHS (\"Recovery Party\").\nThe Recovery Policy provides that, in the event of a required restatement of our previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of one or more errors that are material to those financial statements, we will require reimbursement or forfeiture of any excess incentive compensation received by any Covered Employee during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the earlier of (i) the date our Board of Directors (including a committee of our Board of Directors) concludes or reasonably should have concluded, that CHS is required to prepare an accounting restatement or (ii) the date a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs CHS to prepare an accounting restatement. The amount of excess incentive compensation will be equal to the amount by which the Covered Recovery Party's incentive compensation for the relevant period exceeded the amount that would have been earned or awarded based on the restated financial results, as determined by our Board of Directors. The method used to recover the applicable excess incentive compensation will be determined by our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, and may include requiring reimbursement of cash incentive compensation that was previously paid, forfeiting any incentive compensation contribution made under the Deferred Compensation Plan, offsetting the recovered amount from any compensation or incentive compensation that may be earned or awarded in the future or taking any other remedial or recovery action permitted by law.\nDetrimental Conduct Policy\nOn September 6, 2023, our Board of Directors approved the adoption of a detrimental conduct policy (the \"Detrimental Conduct Policy\") effective as of December 1, 2023. The Detrimental Conduct Policy applies to current and former officers and employees of CHS and its affiliated companies (each a \"Covered Person\").\nThe Detrimental Conduct Policy also provides that, in the event our Board of Directors determines in good faith that a Covered Person has engaged in detrimental conduct, we may, (i) require the Covered Person reimburse or forfeit all or a portion of the Covered Person's incentive compensation with such forfeited amounts to be determined by our Board of Directors, (ii) conduct disciplinary action, up to, and including termination and (iii) report such Covered Person to applicable governmental authorities for possible criminal prosecution. For purposes of the Detrimental Conduct Policy, detrimental conduct includes:\ndeliberate and continued failure, after delivery of notice to such Covered Person by us, by a Covered Person to substantially perform his or her duties and responsibilities in a manner that has an adverse effect on us;\nknowing and willful violation of any law, government regulation or company code of conduct or policy;\nknowingly encouraging or directing others to violate any law, government regulation or company code of conduct or policy;\nfraud or dishonesty resulting or intended to result in personal enrichment at our expense;\nthe commission of any felony or gross misconduct in the performance of duties that results in economic harm to us;\nviolation of any company policies regarding substance abuse and/or illegal drug use;\nknowingly encouraging or directing others to violate safety measures resulting, or intended to result, in harm to any person or destruction or damage to any property of ours or other parties;\nknowing and willful engagement in discrimination or harassment (whether sexual or otherwise) in violation of any of our policies prohibiting discrimination and/or harassment;\nknowingly encouraging or directing others to violate any of CHS's policies prohibiting discrimination and harassment (whether sexual or otherwise); and\nfailing to cooperate with CHS in the investigation of any potential violations of the Code of Conduct or other applicable policies.\nAgreements with Named Executive Officers\nMr. Debertin\nOn May 22, 2017, Mr. Debertin was elected as our President and CEO, and in connection therewith entered into an employment agreement with us on that date (the \"Employment Agreement\"). On November 5, 2020, we entered into an amendment to the Employment Agreement (\"Employment Agreement Amendment No. 1\") with Mr. Debertin, pursuant to which the term of the Employment Agreement was extended to August 31, 2023, provided that, pursuant to the terms of the Employment Agreement, beginning on August 31, 2023, and on each August 31 thereafter, the Employment Agreement will automatically renew for an additional one-year period, unless either party notifies the other in writing, at least 120 days in advance of the relevant renewal date, of its intent not to renew the agreement for the additional one-year period. On November 3, 2021, we and Mr. Debertin entered into another amendment (\"Employment Agreement Amendment No. 2\") to the Employment Agreement, pursuant to which the terms of Mr. Debertin's long-term incentive compensation opportunity were amended as set forth below. The amended long-term incentive compensation opportunity set forth by Employment Agreement Amendment No. 2 applies for each three-year performance period that begins on or after September 1, 2021.\nPursuant to the terms of the Employment Agreement, as amended by Employment Agreement Amendment No. 2, Mr. Debertin is entitled to, among other things:\nAn annual base salary of $1,150,000, which has subsequently been increased by our Board of Directors to $1,313,064 and which is subject to further increase by our Board of Directors from time to time;\nA target annual incentive compensation opportunity of 1.5x his annual base salary with a maximum opportunity equal to twice the target opportunity, based on achievement of performance goals set by our Board of Directors; and\nA target long-term incentive compensation award opportunity of 3.0x his average annual base salary over each three-year performance period applicable to that award opportunity, with a threshold opportunity equal to one-half of the target opportunity and a maximum opportunity equal to twice the target opportunity. Prior to the execution of Employment Agreement Amendment No. 2, the Employment Agreement provided Mr. Debertin with a target long-term\nincentive compensation award opportunity of 1.5x his average annual base salary over each three-year performance period applicable to that award opportunity with a maximum opportunity equal to three and one-third times his target award opportunity.\nOn November 1, 2022, we and Mr. Debertin entered into another amendment to the Employment Agreement (\"Employment Agreement Amendment No. 3\"), pursuant to which the term of the Employment Agreement was extended to August 31, 2026, and the termination provisions of the Employment Agreement were amended to provide that Mr. Debertin would receive welfare benefit continuation for two years following the termination of his employment, if Mr. Debertin chooses to retire from the Company on or after August 31, 2025.\nOn November 7, 2023, we and Mr. Debertin entered into another amendment to the Employment Agreement (\"Employment Agreement Amendment No. 4\"), in order to, among other things, recognize his outstanding performance and long tenure and to further emphasize performance-based incentive award opportunities that can be earned for long term strategy execution as reflected in our results relative to goals set at the start of the multi-year performance period, pursuant to which:\nDuring the 2024-2026 ELTIP performance period (and any ELTIP performance period thereafter), Mr. Debertin will be entitled to a target ELTIP award opportunity of 5 times his average annual base salary over each three-year performance period applicable to that award opportunity, with a threshold ELTIP award opportunity equal to one-half of the target ELTIP award opportunity and a maximum ELTIP award opportunity equal to twice the target ELTIP award opportunity. Prior to the execution of Employment Agreement Amendment No. 4, the Employment Agreement (as amended) provided Mr. Debertin with a target ELTIP award opportunity of 3 times his average annual base salary over each three-year performance period applicable to that award opportunity with a maximum ELTIP award opportunity equal to two times his target ELTIP award opportunity; and\nDuring the fiscal year 2024-2026 ELTIP performance period (and any ELTIP performance period thereafter), if Mr. Debertin's employment ends due to death or permanent disability (as defined in our ELTIP) or if he is employed for at least 6 months of such a performance period and his employment ends due to retirement approved (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) by our Board of Directors, then upon completion and certification of performance results for such performance period, he will be eligible for a vested full grant participation in the applicable ELTIP award with the payout factor calculated at the same time as other participants.\nThe Employment Agreement and the compensation payable thereunder is subject to the Recovery Policy and the Detrimental Conduct Policy, each of which is described above.\nThe severance pay and benefits to which Mr. Debertin would be entitled if we terminated his employment without cause or, if he terminated his employment for \"good reason\" are described below under \"Post Employment.\"\nMs. Nelligan\nMs. Nelligan's compensation is set forth in a letter agreement we entered into with her on January 7, 2020 (the \"Nelligan Letter Agreement\"). The Nelligan Letter Agreement provides Ms. Nelligan with an initial annual base salary of $570,000 and a hiring bonus of $200,000 (which has been paid).\nThe Nelligan Letter Agreement provides that Ms. Nelligan's initial target award for purposes of the Annual Variable Pay Plan will be equal to 1.15x her annual base salary on August 31 of each year.\nThe Nelligan Letter Agreement and the compensation payable thereunder is subject to the Recovery Policy and the Detrimental Conduct Policy, each of which is described above.\nThe severance pay and benefits to which Ms. Nelligan would be entitled if we terminated her employment without cause or if she terminated her employment for \"good reason\" are described below under \"Post Employment.\"\nMr. Smith\nMr. Smith's compensation is set forth in a letter agreement we entered into with him on January 1, 2021 (the \"Smith Letter Agreement\"). The Smith Letter Agreement provides Mr. Smith with an initial annual base salary of $570,000 and a hiring bonus in the gross amount of $1,500,000 (\"Hiring Bonus\"). The Smith Letter Agreement provides for the payment of the Hiring Bonus in three installments of $400,000, which have already been paid, and a final installment of $300,000 in 2024, provided Mr. Smith is employed by CHS on the payment date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Smith Letter Agreement provides that,\nin the event of an employment separation by us without good reason prior to payment of any portion of the Hiring Bonus, we will pay the Hiring Bonus in full no later than 60 days from the date of separation.\nThe Smith Letter Agreement provides that Mr. Smith's initial target award for purposes of the Annual Variable Pay Plan will be equal to 1.15x his annual base salary on August 31 of each year. The Smith Letter Agreement also provides that Mr. Smith's initial target award for purposes of the ELTIP will be equal to 1.15x the average of his annual base salary on August 31 of each year in the applicable three-year performance period, and that any award he receives under the ELTIP will be prorated by the number of full months (credited to September 1, 2020) he is eligible for participation in the ELTIP during the respective three-year performance period.\nThe Smith Letter Agreement and the compensation payable thereunder is subject to the Recovery Policy and the Detrimental Conduct Policy, each of which is described above.\nThe severance pay and benefits to which Mr. Smith would be entitled if we terminated his employment without cause or if he terminated his employment for \"good reason\" are described below under \"Post Employment.\"\nTax Considerations\nSection 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (\"Section 162(m)\") generally limits us to a deduction for federal income tax purposes of no more than $1 million of compensation paid to certain current and former executive officers in a taxable year.\nWe believe that Section 162(m) is only one of several relevant considerations in setting compensation. We also believe that Section 162(m) should not be permitted to compromise our ability to design and maintain executive compensation arrangements that, among other things, are intended to attract and retain highly qualified executives in a competitive environment. As a result, we retain the flexibility to provide compensation that we determine to be in our best interests and the best interests of our member-owners, even if that compensation ultimately is not deductible for tax purposes.\nInsider Trading Policy\nCHS is committed to promoting high standards of ethical business conduct and compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. As part of this commitment, we have an Insider Trading Policy governing the purchase, sale and/or other dispositions of our securities by our directors, officers, employees and third-party contractors, that we believe is reasonably designed to promote compliance with insider trading laws, rules and regulations, and the exchange listing standards applicable to us. A copy of our Insider Trading Policy is filed as Exhibit 19.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nShareholder Advisory Votes on Executive Compensation\nBecause we are not subject to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we are not required to, and do not, conduct shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation.\nSummary Compensation Table\nName and Principal Position Year Salary\n(1) Bonus\n(1)(2) Nonequity\nIncentive Plan\nCompensation (1)(3) Change in Pension\nValue and\nNonqualified\nDeferred\nCompensation\nEarnings\n(1)(4) All Other\nCompensation (1)(5-10) Total\n(1)\n(Dollars)\nJay Debertin\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer 2023 $ 1,348,088 - $ 10,685,281 $ 1,109,326 $ 458,759 $ 13,601,454\n2022 1,300,316 - 12,145,152 661,879 372,610 14,479,957\n2021 1,274,819 - 7,229,841 816,884 127,858 9,449,402\nOlivia Nelligan\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Strategy Officer 2023 640,000 - 4,324,000 146,672 177,920 5,288,592\n2022 590,000 - 3,677,444 114,130 139,019 4,520,593\n2021 570,000 100,000 1,866,304 129,853 259,825 2,925,982\nBrandon Smith\nExecutive Vice President, General Counsel 2023 602,767 400,000 4,114,852 138,124 176,677 5,432,420\n2022 581,400 400,000 3,124,550 121,053 241,139 4,468,142\nDarin Hunhoff\nExecutive Vice President, Energy 2023 603,730 - 4,124,032 228,585 176,585 5,132,932\n2022 584,659 - 4,391,964 49,859 150,806 5,177,288\n2021 573,195 - 2,507,251 265,462 54,494 3,400,402\nJohn Griffith Executive Vice President, Ag Business and CHS Hedging 2023 581,667 - 3,902,332 230,942 169,553 4,884,494\n2022 545,000 - 3,357,742 54,067 124,456 4,081,265\n2021 491,274 - 1,753,155 127,620 37,146 2,409,195\n(1) Information on Mr. Smith includes compensation beginning in fiscal 2022, the first year in which he became a Named Executive Officer.\n(2) Includes hiring bonus payment to Ms. Nelligan of $100,000 in fiscal 2021; hiring bonus payments of $400,000 to Mr. Smith in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023.\n(3) Amounts include retention awards earned in fiscal 2022, annual variable pay awards and long-term incentive awards.\nThe Board of Directors approved a retention award for certain of our senior officers, including each of the Named Executive Officers who were both active participants in the 2016-2018 ELTIP and active employees on the date the retention award was approved. Pursuant to its original terms, the retention award would generally be earned only if the participant continued active employment through January 1, 2021. In November 2020, our Board of Directors modified the terms of the retention award to provide that it would generally only be earned if the applicable participant continued active employment through January 1, 2022. The actual retention award value was distributed as follows in fiscal 2022: Mr. Debertin, $1,768,125, Mr. Hunhoff, $371,000, and Mr. Griffith, $180,400. Because Ms. Nelligan and Mr. Smith were not active participants in the 2016-2018 ELTIP or actively employed by us on the date the retention award was approved, they were not granted a retention award.\nThe actual annual variable pay award value was as follows in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively: Mr. Debertin, $4,096,800, $3,939,192 and $3,357,300; Ms. Nelligan, $1,518,000, $1,380,000 and $1,150,862; Mr. Smith, $1,404,380 and $1,350,330 (Mr. Smith was not a Named Executive Officer in fiscal 2021); Mr. Hunhoff, $1,403,920, $1,357,900 and $1,157,313; and Mr. Griffith, $1,380,000, $1,253,500 and $1,009,528.\nThe actual long-term incentive award value was as follows in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively: Mr. Debertin, $6,588,481, $6,437,835 and $3,872,541; Ms. Nelligan, $2,806,000, $2,297,444 and $715,442; Mr. Smith, $2,710,472, $1,774,220 (Mr. Smith was not a Named Executive Officer in fiscal 2021); Mr. Hunhoff, $2,720,112, $2,663,064 and $1,349,938; and Mr. Griffith, $2,522,332, $1,923,842 and $743,627.\n(4) This column represents both changes in pension value and above-market earnings on deferred compensation.

The early retirement benefit under the cash balance plan formula is equal to the participants account balance; and\nPayments under the cash balance formula of the Pension Plan assume a lump sum payment. SERP benefits are payable as a lump sum.\nThe normal form of benefit for a single Named Executive Officer is a life-only annuity, and for a married Named Executive Officer the normal form of benefit is a 50% joint and survivor annuity. Other annuity forms are also available on an actuarial equivalent basis.

Named Executive Officers may defer up to 75% of their base salary and up to 100% of their annual variable pay to the Deferred Compensation Plan. Earnings on amounts deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan are determined based on the investment election made by the Named Executive Officer from thirteen market-based notional investments with a varying level of risk selected by us and a fixed rate fund. The notional investment returns for fiscal 2023 were as follows:\nFund Name Symbol Investment Return\nVanguard Federal Money Market Fund VMFXX 4.36 %\nVanguard LifeStrategy Income Fund VASIX 2.22 %\nVanguard LifeStrategy Conservative Growth Fund VSCGX 5.05 %\nVanguard LifeStrategy Moderate Growth Fund VSMGX 7.94 %\nVanguard LifeStrategy Growth Fund VASGX 10.78 %\nVanguard International Value Fund VTRIX 16.49 %\nPRIMECAP Fund Admiral VPMAX 22.66 %\nInternational Growth Fund Admiral VWILX 9.92 %\nInstitutional Index Fund Institutional Plus VIIIX 15.92 %\nExtended Market Index Institutional VIEIX 8.44 %\nTotal International Stock Index Fund Institutional Shares VTSNX 12.15 %\nJanus Henderson Triton Fund Class N JGMNX 7.67 %\nAmerican Century Small Cap Value Fund R6 Class ASVDX 5.39 %\nFixed Rate Fund N/A 4.00 %\nNamed Executive Officers may change their investment election daily. Payments of amounts deferred are made in accordance with elections by the Named Executive Officer and in accordance with Section 409A under the Internal Revenue Code. Payments under the Deferred Compensation Plan may be made at a specified date elected by the Named Executive Officer or deferred until retirement, disability, or death. Such payments would be made in a lump sum. In the event of retirement, the Named Executive Officer can elect to receive payments either in a lump sum or annual installments up to 10 years.\nFor a discussion of the material terms and conditions of the Deferred Compensation Plan, see \"Compensation Discussion and Analysis\" above.\nPost Employment\nPursuant to the terms of his Employment Agreement, Mr. Debertin, our President and CEO, is entitled to severance in the event that his employment is terminated by us without cause or by him with \"good reason.\" Specifically, severance under the Employment Agreement would consist of:\nThe annual incentive compensation Mr. Debertin would have been entitled to receive for the year in which his termination occurred as if he had continued until the end of that fiscal year, determined based on our actual performance for that fiscal year relative to the performance goals applicable to Mr. Debertin (with that portion of the annual incentive compensation based on completion or partial completion of previously specified personal goals equal to 30% of the target annual incentive), prorated for the number of days in the fiscal year through Mr. Debertins termination date and generally payable in a cash lump sum at the time that incentive awards are payable to other participants;\nTwo times Mr. Debertin's base salary plus two times his target annual incentive compensation, payable in three equal installments with the first installment payable 60 days following termination and the second and third installments payable on the first and second anniversary dates of termination, respectively; and\nHealth and welfare benefits continuation for two years following termination.\nThe Nelligan Letter Agreement provides for severance in the event Ms. Nelligan's employment is terminated by us without cause or by her with \"good reason\" in the amount of one year of base pay and prorated annual variable pay, payable as a lump sum.\nThe Smith Letter Agreement provides for severance in the event Mr. Smith's employment is terminated by us without cause or by him with \"good reason\" in the amount of one year of base pay and prorated annual variable pay, payable as a lump sum.\nDuring fiscal 2023, Mr. Hunhoff and Mr. Griffith were covered by a broad-based employee severance program that provides executives with a lump sum payment of 26 weeks of pay, plus one week of pay per year of service, with a 12-month cap, in the event their position is eliminated.\nThe severance pay that the Named Executive Officers would have been entitled to in the specific events noted above, in each case, as of the last business day of fiscal 2023 is as follows:\nName Position Amount\n(Dollars)\nJay Debertin (1)(2)\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer $ 6,878,376\nOlivia Nelligan (3)\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Strategy Officer 1,419,000\nBrandon Smith (3)\nExecutive Vice President, General Counsel 1,312,790\nDarin Hunhoff Executive Vice President, Energy 563,446\nJohn Griffith Executive Vice President, Ag Business and CHS Hedging 415,385\n(1) Includes the value of health and welfare benefits based on current monthly rates.\n(2) For purposes of calculating the prorated portion of Mr. Debertin's unpaid annual variable pay award for the fiscal year in which the termination occurred, assumes an annual variable pay award at target performance for the entire fiscal year.\n(3) Assumes an annual variable pay award at target performance for the entire fiscal year.\nThere are no other severance benefits offered to our Named Executive Officers, except for up to 12 months of career transition services and government mandated benefits such as COBRA. Except as otherwise set forth above, the method of payment would be a lump sum. Named Executive Officers not covered by employment agreements are not offered any special postretirement health and welfare benefits that are not offered to other similarly situated (i.e., age and service) salaried employees. The compensation payable to the Named Executive Officers is subject to the Recovery Policy and the Detrimental Conduct Policy, as applicable.\nCEO Pay Ratio\nThe following pay ratio and supporting information compares the annual total compensation of our CEO to our median employee, as required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC. For fiscal 2023, our last completed fiscal year:\nAs permitted by the SEC's pay ratio rules, we determined that we could use the same median employee that we identified last year since there were no significant changes to our overall employee population or the overall employee compensation program that would significantly impact our fiscal 2023 pay ratio. Similarly, there were no significant changes to the median employee's compensation arrangements during the fiscal year that would significantly impact the pay ratio disclosure. For more detail on how we identified the median employee, please refer to the pay ratio disclosure in our Form 10-K for fiscal year ending August 31, 2022.\nThe median employee's compensation, calculated in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC, was $88,202. This calculation includes a reasonable assumption regarding the median employee's achievement of individual performance goals for a portion of the annual incentive award based on historical performance.\nThe annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table set forth above, was $13,601,454.\nBased on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median employee was 154:1.\nIn adopting the pay ratio rule, the SEC expressly sought to provide flexibility to each company to determine the methodology that best suits its own facts and circumstances. Our pay ratio should not be compared to other companies' pay ratios, because it is based on a methodology specific to us, and certain material assumptions, adjustments and estimates have been made in the calculation of the ratio.\nDirector Compensation\nOverview\nOur Board of Directors met eight times during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023. Each director (other than the chair of the Board) is a member of two Board committees. At a minimum, each Board committee meets during each of the Board's six regular meetings. For fiscal 2023, each nonemployee director was provided compensation as follows:\na monthly retainer equivalent to $89,000 per year from September 1, 2022, through December 31, 2022, and equivalent to $93,700 per year from January 1, 2023, through August 31, 2023, paid in 12 monthly payments;\nactual expenses and a travel allowance;\nadditional annual compensation, as applicable, for board leadership, including $24,000 for the chair of the Board, $6,000 for the first vice chair and the secretary-treasurer, $9,000 for all Board committee chairs, and $3,000 for members of the Executive Committee who are not eligible for other premiums;\na per diem meeting fee of $500 plus actual expenses and travel allowance for each day spent at meetings other than regular Board meetings and the CHS Annual Meeting; and\na meeting fee of $250 for conference calls or other short virtual meetings other than regular Board meetings.\nThe number of days spent at meetings other than regular Board meetings and the CHS Annual Meeting may not exceed 55 days annually, except that the chair of the Board is exempt from this limit. There is no cap on meeting fees permitted for conference calls or other short virtual meetings.\nThese amounts (other than the $93,700 annual compensation amount), as well as the minimum retirement plan account contribution for the fiscal years 2023-2025 performance period under the Deferred Compensation Plan discussed in greater detail below, were determined after taking into account the analysis included in the market study of director compensation conducted for the Governance Committee by Mercer (U.S.), a global compensation consulting firm, in fiscal 2019. During fiscal 2023, based on a market update presented by Mercer, our Board of Directors approved increasing annual director compensation from $93,700 to $98,500, increasing the first vice chair and secretary-treasurer additional annual compensation from $6,000 to $9,000 and increasing the additional annual compensation for members of the Executive Committee who are not eligible for other premiums from $3,000 to $6,000, effective January 1, 2024.\nFurther, directors are eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan through a retirement plan account. Other than direct contributions, contributions to the retirement plan account in the Deferred Compensation Plan are made based on our ROIC performance during specific three-year periods, with ROIC defined in the same manner as for the ELTIP. We believe that using the ROIC performance metric for this purpose aligns the interests of our directors with the interests of our management and member-owners. The ROIC performance goal levels are established and approved by our Board of Directors prior to each three-year performance period. Deferred Compensation Plan credits are based on ROIC performance results, as detailed on the following pages.\nThe amounts paid to our Board of Directors are subject to the Recovery Policy.\nDirector Retirement and Health Care Benefits\nMembers of our Board of Directors are eligible for certain retirement and health care benefits based on election date. The director retirement plan is a defined benefit plan and provides for a monthly benefit for the director's lifetime, beginning at age 60. Benefits are immediately vested and the monthly benefit is determined according to the following formula: $250 times years of service on the Board (up to a maximum of 15 years). Under no event will the benefit payment be payable for less than 120 months. Payment will be made to the retired director's beneficiary in the event of the director's death before 120 payments are made.\nEffective August 31, 2011, future accruals under the director retirement plan were frozen. Directors elected after that date are not eligible for benefits under that plan.\nRetirement benefits are funded by a rabbi trust, with a balance of $6.8 million as of August 31, 2023.\nDirectors serving as of September 1, 2005, and their eligible dependents, are eligible to participate in our medical, life, dental and vision plans. We will pay 100% of the medical premium for the director and the eligible director's dependents while the director is active on the Board. Term life insurance cost is paid by the director. Retired directors and their dependents are eligible to continue medical and dental insurance with the premiums paid by us after they leave the Board, until they are eligible\nfor Medicare. In the event a director's coverage ends due to death or Medicare eligibility, we will pay 100% of the premium for the eligible spouse and eligible dependents until the spouse reaches Medicare age or upon death, if earlier.\nNew directors elected on or after December 1, 2006, and their eligible dependents, are eligible to participate in our medical, dental and vision plans. We will pay 100% of the premium for the director and eligible dependents while the director is active on the Board. In the event a director leaves the Board prior to Medicare eligibility, premiums will be shared based on the following schedule:\nYears of Service Director CHS\nUp to 3 100% 0%\n3 to 6 50% 50%\n6+ 0% 100%\nIn the event a director's coverage ends due to death or Medicare eligibility, premiums for the eligible spouse and eligible dependents will be shared based on the same schedule until the spouse reaches Medicare age or upon death, if earlier.\nDeferred Compensation Plan\nDirectors are eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan. Each participating director may elect to defer up to 100% of his or her monthly director fees into the Deferred Compensation Plan. This must be done prior to the beginning of the calendar year in which the fees will be earned, or in the case of newly elected directors, upon election to the Board. During fiscal year 2023, the following directors deferred Board fees pursuant to the Deferred Compensation Plan: Mr. Beckman, Mr. Clemensen, Mr. Erickson, Mr. Fritel, Mr. Johnsrud, Mr. Kehl, Mr. Meyer and Mr. Throener.\nBenefits are funded in a rabbi trust. The Deferred Compensation Plan rabbi trust balance reported elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K includes amounts deferred by the directors.\nEach year we will credit an amount to each director's retirement plan account under the Deferred Compensation Plan. The fiscal year 2023 credit to each director's retirement plan account was based on the following ROIC performance goals for fiscal years 2021-2023:\nAmount Credited* ROIC Performance\n$100,000 (Superior performance) 7.5%\n$50,000 (Maximum) 6.5%\n$25,000 (Target, minimum contribution amount) 5.5%\n*The amount credited for the fiscal years 2021-2023 performance period was required to be mathematically interpolated when results occurred between the superior performance, maximum and target ROIC performance levels. If results had been less than the target ROIC performance level, the amount credited would have been $25,000.\nActual ROIC performance for the fiscal years 2021-2023 performance period was 13.1% and, accordingly, $100,000 was credited to each director's retirement plan account under the Deferred Compensation Plan, except $75,000 was credited for newly elected director Mr. Stroh and $8,333 was credited for former director Mr. Riegel. This amount is reflected in the Director Compensation table.\nUpon leaving our Board of Directors during the fiscal year, a director's credit for that partial fiscal year will be the target amount ($25,000) prorated through the end of the month in which the director departs. Directors who join our Board of Directors during the fiscal year receive credit for that partial fiscal year based on the actual ROIC for that fiscal year, prorated from the first of the month following the month in which the director joins our Board of Directors to the end of the fiscal year.\n2023 Director Compensation\nName Fees Earned or\nPaid in Cash (1) Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings (2) All Other\nCompensation (3) Total\n(Dollars)\nDavid Beckman $ 108,258 $ 51 $ 119,158 $ 227,467\nClinton J.

Change in pension value is the aggregate change in the actuarial present value of the director's benefit under his retirement program, and nonqualified earnings, if applicable. The change in pension value will vary by director based on several factors including age, service, pension benefit elected (lump sum or annuity), discount rate and mortality factor used to calculate the benefit due. Future accruals under the plan were frozen as of August 31, 2011, as stated above. The following directors had the following changes in pension values during fiscal 2023: Mr. Blew, $(1,797); Mr. Fritel, $(22,427); Mr. Kayser, $(15,368); Mr. Riegel, $(12,165); and Mr. Schurr, $(5,779). Negative values are not reflected in the sum reported in this column.\nAbove-market earnings represent earnings exceeding 120% of the Federal Reserve long-term rate on applicable funds as determined by the IRS. The following directors had above-market earnings during fiscal 2023: Mr. Beckman, $51; Mr. Blew, $4,695; Mr. Clemensen, $376; Mr. Cordes, $5,041; Mr. Erickson, $308; Mr. Farrell, $1,464; Mr. Fritel, $15; Mr. Holm, $1,849; Mr. Johnsrud, $1,168; Mr. Jones, $178; Mr. Kayser, $4,318; Mr. Kehl, $138; Mr. Meyer, $1,260; Mr. Riegel, $1,405; Mr. Schurr, $1,328; Mr. Stroh, $0; Mr. Throener, $19; and Ms. Wagner, $373.\n(3) All other compensation includes health insurance premiums, travel accident insurance and related companion travel expenses for trips made with a director on CHS business. Total amounts vary primarily due to the variations in health insurance premiums, which are due to the number of dependents covered. The health insurance premiums paid were less than $25,000 for each director, other than Mr. Blew, Mr. Jones, Mr. Kayser, Mr. Schurr and Mr. Throener, for whom we paid health insurance premiums of $27,800; and Mr. Kehl, for whom we paid health insurance premiums of $26,248.\nAll other compensation also includes fiscal 2023 director retirement plan Deferred Compensation Plan contributions of $100,000 for each director, except for newly elected director Mr. Stroh, $75,000; and for former director, Mr. Riegel, $8,333.\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\nOur Board of Directors does not have a compensation committee. The Executive Committee performs the equivalent functions of a compensation committee with respect to our CEO, and the Governance Committee performs the equivalent functions of a compensation committee, other than with respect to our CEO.\nDuring fiscal 2023, the members of the Executive Committee were Messrs. Schurr (chair), Cordes (first vice chair), Blew, Holm and Kehl, and the members of the Governance Committee were Mr. Jones (chair), Mr. Kehl (vice chair), and Messrs. Blew, Cordes, Farrell and Kayser. During fiscal 2022, no executive officer of CHS served on the compensation committee (or other board committee performing equivalent functions) or board of directors of any other entity that had any executive officer who also served on the Executive Committee, the Governance Committee or our Board of Directors. None of the directors who served as a member of the Executive Committee or Governance Committee during fiscal 2023 are, or have been, officers or employees of CHS, other than Mr. Cordes, who was an employee of CHS Hedging until 2016.\nSee Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for directors, including Messrs. Cordes, Erickson, Fritel, Johnsrud, Jones, Kayser, Kehl, Throener and Schurr who were a party to related-person transactions.\nCompensation Committee Report\nThe Executive Committee (the committee of our Board of Directors that performs the equivalent functions of a compensation committee with respect to our CEO) and the Governance Committee (the committee of our Board of Directors that performs the equivalent functions of a compensation committee, other than with respect to our CEO) have each reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC with management and, based on such review and discussions, each of the Executive Committee and the Governance Committee recommended to our Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRespectfully submitted,\nExecutive Committee\nDaniel Schurr, Chair\nClinton J.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE\nBecause our directors must be active patrons of CHS or of an affiliated association, transactions between us and our directors are customary and expected. Transactions include the sales of commodities to us and the purchases of products and services from us, as well as patronage refunds and equity redemptions received from us. During the year ended August 31, 2023, the value of those transactions between a particular director (and any immediate family member of a director, which includes any child, stepchild, parent, stepparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law or sister-in-law and any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing the household of such director) and us in which the total amount involved exceeded $120,000 is shown below.\nTransaction Type\nName Transactions with CHS Cash Patronage Dividends\n(Dollars)\nScott Cordes $ 936,054 $ 4,425\nJon Erickson 551,135 12,906\nDavid Johnsrud 3,258,655 40,449\nTracy Jones 4,705,785 56,800\nDavid Kayser 1,295,657 20,999\nRussell Kehl 8,388,913 168,872\nPerry Meyer 265,993 -\nKevin Throener 2,071,531 23,740\nAdditionally, Clemensen Farms, Inc., which is owned by our director Hal Clemensen, entered into a crop input loan with CHS Capital in November 2022 (\"Clemensen Loan\"). The Clemensen Loan has an interest rate of 0% per annum, and it matures in February 2024. The largest aggregate amount of principal outstanding under the Clemensen Loan during the year ended August 31, 2023, and the balance on August 31, 2023, was $232,466. In addition, Kehl Farms, LLC, which is owned by our director Russell Kehl, entered into two 2023 crop inputs loans with CHS Capital for the purchase of crop inputs, seeds, supplies and fuel in February 2023 (\"Kehl Loans\"). The Kehl Loans accrue interest at the rates of 11.4% and 2.5% per annum, payable upon maturity in February 2024. The largest aggregate amount of principal outstanding under the Kehl Loans during the year ended August 31, 2023, and the balance on August 31, 2023, was $4,587,017. During the year ended August 31, 2023, no principal or interest was paid on the Kehl Loans. Also, in December 2021, our director Kevin Throener entered into a crop inputs loan with CHS Capital with a maturity date in December 2023 (\"Throener Loan\"). The largest aggregate amount of principal outstanding under the Throener Loan during the year ended August 31, 2023, and the balance on August 31, 2023, was $212,263. During the year ended August 31, 2023, $514 in interest was paid on the Throener Loan. The terms of these financing arrangements were provided pursuant to financing programs widely available to our qualified customers.\nIn addition, our wholly-owned subsidiary, CHS Hedging, LLC, is a clearing broker, and from time to time our directors and their affiliates may place orders and clear trades with CHS Hedging in the ordinary course of business. CHS Hedging handles such trades on substantially the same terms and conditions as other similarly situated individuals who are not directors.\nReview, Approval or Ratification of Related Party Transactions\nPursuant to its amended and restated charter, our Audit Committee has responsibility for review and approval of all transactions between CHS and any related parties or affiliates of CHS, including its officers and directors, other than transactions in the ordinary course of business and on market terms.\nRelated persons can include any of our directors or executive officers and any of their immediate family members, as defined by the SEC. In evaluating related person transactions, the committee members apply the same standards they apply to their general responsibilities as members of the Audit Committee. The committee will approve a related person transaction when, in its good faith judgment, the transaction is in the best interest of CHS. To identify related person transactions, each year we require our directors and officers to complete a questionnaire identifying any transactions with CHS in which the officers or directors or their immediate family members have an interest. We also review our business records to identify potentially qualifying transactions between a related party and us. In addition, we have a written policy addressing related persons (included in our Code of Conduct) that describes our expectation that all directors, officers and employees who may have a potential or apparent conflict of interest will notify our legal department of any such transactions.\nDirector Independence\nWe are a Minnesota cooperative corporation managed by a Board of Directors made up of 17 members. Nomination and election of the directors is done by eight separate regions. In addition to meeting other requirements for directorship, candidates must reside in the region from which they are elected. Directors are elected for three-year terms. The terms of directors are staggered and no more than seven director positions are elected at an annual meeting of members. Nominations for director elections are made by the voting members at each region caucus held during our annual meeting of members. Neither the Board of Directors nor management of CHS participates in the nomination process. Accordingly, we have no nominating committee.\nThe following directors satisfy the definition of director independence set forth in the rules of The Nasdaq:\nIndependent Directors\nDavid Beckman Steve Fritel Daniel Schurr\nClinton J. Blew Alan Holm Jerrad Stroh\nHal Clemensen David Kayser Kevin Throener\nJon Erickson Russell Kehl Cortney Wagner\nMark Farrell Perry Meyer\nFurther, although we do not need to rely upon an exemption for the Board of Directors as a whole, we are exempt pursuant to The Nasdaq rules from The Nasdaq director independence requirements as they relate to the makeup of the Board of Directors as a whole and the makeup of the committee performing the functions of a compensation committee. The Nasdaq exemption applies to cooperatives that are structured to comply with relevant state law and federal tax law and that do not have a publicly traded class of common stock. All of the members of our Audit Committee are independent. All of the members of our Governance Committee and Executive Committee (the committees of our Board of Directors that perform the equivalent functions of a compensation committee) are independent other than Mr. Cordes and Mr. Jones.\nIndependence of CEO and Board Chair Positions\nOur bylaws prohibit any employee of CHS from serving on the Board of Directors. Accordingly, our CEO may not serve as chair of the Board or in any CHS Board capacity. We believe this leadership structure creates independence between the Board and management and is an important feature of appropriate checks and balances in the governance of CHS.\nBoard of Directors' Role in Risk Oversight\nIt is senior management's responsibility to identify, assess and manage our exposures to risk. Our Board of Directors plays an important and significant role in overseeing the overall risk management approach, including the review and, where appropriate, approval of guidelines and policies that govern our risk management process. Our management and Board of Directors have jointly identified multiple broad categories of risk exposure, each of which could impact operations and affect results at an enterprise level. Each such significant enterprise level risk is reviewed periodically by management with the Board of Directors and/or a committee of the Board as appropriate. The review includes an analysis by management of the continued applicability of the risk, our performance in managing or mitigating the risk, and possible additional or emerging risks to consider. As additional areas of risk are identified, our Board of Directors and/or a committee of the Board provide a review and oversight of management's actions to identify, assess and manage that risk. We continue to develop a formal enterprise risk management program intended to support integration of the risk assessment and management discipline and controls into major decision-making and business processes. The Corporate Risk Committee is involved in reviewing and approving the enterprise risk management framework and is responsible for overseeing its effectiveness on an ongoing basis. When appropriate, the Corporate Risk Committee meets jointly with the Audit Committee to discuss common financial or other risks across CHS that may have potential material impact to our financial statements.

Audit Committee Charter, as amended, our Audit Committee adopted the following policies and procedures for the approval of the engagement of an independent registered public accounting firm for audit, review or attest services and for preapproval of certain permissible nonaudit services, all to ensure auditor independence.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm will provide audit, review and attest services only at the direction of, and pursuant to engagement fees and terms approved by our Audit Committee. Our Audit Committee approves in advance all nonaudit services to be performed by the independent auditors and the fees and compensation to be paid to the independent auditors. Our Audit Committee approved 100% of the services listed above in advance.\nPART IV ITEM 15.

Debertin\nAttorney-in-fact\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of CHS Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CHS Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of changes in equities and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2023, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts and reserves for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2023, appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation of Grain Inventories and Grain Forward Commodity Purchase and Sales Contracts\nAs described in Notes 4, 15, and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's grain and oilseed inventories were $1,100.0 million as of August 31, 2023, and commodity derivatives in an asset and liability position were $280.4 million and $349.1 million, respectively, as of August 31, 2023, of which grain and oilseed make up the majority of forward commodity purchase and sales contracts. Management enters into various derivative instruments to manage the Company's exposure to movements primarily associated with agricultural and energy commodity prices. The net realizable value of grain inventories and fair value of grain forward commodity purchase and sales contracts are determined using inputs that are generally based on exchange traded prices and/or recent market bids and offers, including location-specific adjustments. Location-specific inputs are driven by local market supply and demand and are generally based on broker or dealer quotations or market transactions in either listed or over-the-counter markets.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of grain inventories and grain forward commodity purchase and sales contracts is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management to determine the net realizable value of grain inventories and the fair value of grain forward commodity purchase and sales contracts and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management's inputs related to exchange traded prices and/or recent market bids and offers, including location-specific adjustments.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among others, (i) testing management's process for determining the net realizable value of grain inventories and the fair value of grain forward commodity purchase and sales contracts; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation models; (iii) testing the accuracy of the underlying data used in the valuations; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of inputs used by management related to the exchange traded prices and/or recent market bids and offers, including location-specific adjustments. Evaluating management's inputs related to the exchange traded prices and/or recent market bids and offers, including location-specific adjustments involved (i) comparing the exchange traded prices and/or recent market bids and location-specific inputs to third-party information; and (ii) comparing the location-specific adjustments to broker or dealer quotations or market transactions in either listed or over-the-counter markets.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nNovember 8, 2023\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1998.\nCHS INC.

(referred to herein as \"CHS,\" \"company,\" \"we,\" \"us\" or \"our\") is the nation's leading integrated agricultural cooperative. As a cooperative, CHS is owned by farmers and ranchers and member cooperatives (\"members\") across the United States. We also have preferred shareholders who own shares of our five series of preferred stock, all of which are listed and traded on the Global Select Market of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\"The Nasdaq\"). See Note 12, Equities, for more detailed information.\nWe buy commodities from and provide products and services to individual agricultural producers, local cooperatives and other companies (including member and other nonmember customers), both domestically and internationally. Those products and services include initial agricultural inputs such as fuels, farm supplies, crop nutrients and crop protection products, as well as agricultural outputs that include grains and oilseeds, processed grains and oilseeds, renewable fuels and food products. A portion of our operations are conducted through equity investments and joint ventures whose operating results are not fully consolidated with our results; rather, a proportionate share of the income or loss from those entities is included as a component in our net income under the equity method of accounting.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CHS and all our subsidiaries and limited liability companies in which we have control. The effects of all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.\nThe notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to our Energy, Ag and Nitrogen Production reportable segments, as well as our Corporate and Other category, which represents an aggregation of individually immaterial operating segments. The Nitrogen Production reportable segment consists of our investment in CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC (\"CF Nitrogen\"), and allocated expenses. See Note 14, Segment Reporting, for more information.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nSignificant accounting policies are summarized below or within the related notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash equivalents include short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates the fair value due to the short-term nature of the instruments.\nRestricted cash is included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets within other current assets and primarily relates to customer deposits for futures and option contracts associated with regulated commodities held in separate accounts as required under federal and other regulations. Pursuant to the requirements of the Commodity Exchange Act, such funds must be carried in separate accounts that are designated as segregated customer accounts, as applicable. Restricted cash also includes funds held in escrow pursuant to applicable regulations limiting their use.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as reported within our Consolidated Balance Sheets that aggregates to the amount presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nAugust 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,765,286 $ 793,957 $ 413,159\nRestricted cash included in other current assets 79,301 109,517 129,325\nTotal cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 1,844,587 $ 903,474 $ 542,484\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nNo recent accounting pronouncements are expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nNote 2 Revenues\nWe provide a wide variety of products and services, from agricultural inputs such as fuels, farm supplies and agronomy products, to agricultural outputs that include grain and oilseed, processed grains and oilseeds and food products, and renewable fuels production and marketing. We primarily conduct our operations and derive revenues within our Energy and Ag segments. Our Energy segment derives its revenues through refining, wholesaling and retailing of petroleum products. Our Ag segment derives its revenues through origination and marketing of grain, including service activities conducted at export terminals; through wholesale agronomy sales of crop nutrient and crop protection products; from sales of soybean meal, refined soy oil and soyflour products; through production and marketing of renewable fuels; and through retail sales of petroleum and agronomy products, processed sunflowers, and feed and farm supplies. Corporate and Other primarily consists of our financing and hedging businesses.\nRevenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied, which generally occurs when control of the goods has transferred to the customer in accordance with the underlying contract. For the majority of our contracts with customers, control transfers to customers at a point in time when goods and/or services have been delivered, as that is generally when legal title, physical possession and risks and rewards of ownership of the goods and/or services transfer to the customer. In limited arrangements, control transfers over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the service as we complete our performance obligation(s). Revenue is recognized as the transaction price we expect to be entitled to in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. For physically settled derivative sales contracts that are outside the scope of the revenue guidance, we recognize revenue when control of the inventory is transferred. Revenues arising from our financing business are recognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 470, Debt (\"ASC Topic 470\") and fall outside the scope of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC Topic 606\").\nShipping and Handling Costs\nShipping and handling amounts billed to a customer as part of a sales transaction are included in revenues, and the related costs are included in cost of goods sold. Shipping and handling is treated as a fulfillment activity, rather than a promised service, and therefore is not considered a separate performance obligation.\nTaxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities\nRevenues are recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant governmental authority.\nContract Costs\nCommissions related to contracts with a duration of less than one year are expensed as incurred. We recognize incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets we otherwise would have recognized is one year or less.\nDisaggregation of Revenues\nThe following table presents revenues recognized under ASC Topic 606, disaggregated by reportable segment, as well as the amount of revenues recognized under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (\"ASC Topic 815\"), and other applicable accounting guidance for the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Other applicable accounting guidance primarily includes revenues recognized under ASC Topic 470 and ASC Topic 842, Leases (\"ASC Topic 842\"), that fall outside the scope of ASC Topic 606.\nYear ended August 31, 2023\nReportable Segment* ASC Topic 606 ASC Topic 815 Other Guidance Total Revenues\n(Dollars in thousands)\nEnergy $ 8,996,149 $ 1,100,764 $ - $ 10,096,913\nAg 9,808,664 25,606,485 10,055 35,425,204\nCorporate and Other 26,001 - 41,886 67,887\nTotal revenues $ 18,830,814 $ 26,707,249 $ 51,941 $ 45,590,004\nYear ended August 31, 2022\nReportable Segment* ASC Topic 606 ASC Topic 815 Other Guidance Total Revenues\n(Dollars in thousands)\nEnergy $ 9,302,400 $ 992,374 $ - $ 10,294,774\nAg 10,784,831 26,646,003 29,377 37,460,211\nCorporate and Other 16,625 - 20,056 36,681\nTotal revenues $ 20,103,856 $ 27,638,377 $ 49,433 $ 47,791,666\nYear ended August 31, 2021\nReportable Segment* ASC Topic 606 ASC Topic 815 Other Guidance Total Revenues\n(Dollars in thousands)\nEnergy $ 5,680,391 $ 694,870 $ - $ 6,375,261\nAg 7,491,484 24,517,033 26,825 32,035,342\nCorporate and Other 18,325 - 19,105 37,430\nTotal revenues $ 13,190,200 $ 25,211,903 $ 45,930 $ 38,448,033\n*Our Nitrogen Production reportable segment represents an equity method investment that records earnings and allocated expenses but not revenues.\nLess than 1% of revenues accounted for under ASC Topic 606 included within the table above are recorded over time and relate primarily to service contracts.\nContract Assets and Contract Liabilities\nContract assets relate to unbilled amounts arising from goods that have already been transferred to the customer where the right to payment is not conditional on the passage of time. This results in recognition of an asset, as the amount of revenue recognized at a certain point in time exceeds the amount billed to customers. Contract assets are recorded in receivables within our Consolidated Balance Sheets and were $16.2 million and $17.2 million as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nContract liabilities relate to advance payments received from customers for goods and services that we have yet to provide. Contract liabilities of $240.0 million and $541.5 million as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, are recorded within other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and are recognized as revenues within the next respective fiscal year.\nNote 3 Receivables\nReceivables as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, are as follows:\n2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands)\nTrade accounts receivable $ 2,010,162 $ 2,626,623\nCHS Capital short-term notes receivable 845,192 644,875\nOther 327,084 404,734\nGross receivables 3,182,438 3,676,232\nLess allowances and reserves 76,627 127,917\nTotal receivables $ 3,105,811 $ 3,548,315\nTrade Accounts Receivable\nTrade accounts receivable are recorded at net realizable value, which includes an allowance for expected credit losses in accordance with ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (\"ASC Topic 326\"). The allowance for expected credit losses is based on our best estimate of expected credit losses in existing receivable balances and is determined using historical write-off experience, adjusted for various industry and regional data and current expectations of future credit losses. Receivables from related parties are disclosed in Note 18, Related Party Transactions. No third-party customer accounted for more than 10% of the total receivables balance as of August 31, 2023 or 2022.\nCHS Capital Notes Receivable\nNotes Receivable\nCHS Capital, LLC (\"CHS Capital\"), our wholly-owned subsidiary, has short-term notes receivable from commercial and producer borrowers. The short-term notes receivable have maturity terms of 12 months or less and are reported at their outstanding unpaid principal balances, less an allowance for expected credit losses, as CHS Capital has the intent and ability to hold the applicable loans for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff. The carrying value of CHS Capital short-term notes receivable approximates fair value given the notes' short-term duration and use of market pricing adjusted for risk.\nNotes receivable from commercial borrowers are collateralized by various combinations of mortgages, personal property, accounts and notes receivable, inventories and assignments of certain regional cooperatives' capital stock. These loans are primarily originated in the states of Minnesota, Montana and North Dakota. CHS Capital also has loans receivable from producer borrowers that are collateralized by various combinations of growing crops, livestock, inventories, accounts receivable, personal property and supplemental mortgages and are primarily originated in the same states as the commercial notes, as well as South Dakota.\nIn addition to the short-term balances included in the table above, CHS Capital had long-term notes receivable, with durations of generally not more than 10 years, totaling $61.1 million and $54.3 million as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The long-term notes receivable are included in other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of August 31, 2023 and 2022, commercial notes represented 15% and 25%, respectively, and producer notes represented 85% and 75%, respectively, of total CHS Capital notes receivable.\nCHS Capital has commitments to extend credit to customers if there are no violations of any contractually established conditions. As of August 31, 2023, CHS Capital customers had additional available credit of $1.1 billion.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nCHS Capital maintains an allowance for loan losses that is an estimate of current expected losses inherent in the loans receivable portfolio. In accordance with ASC Topic 326, the allowance for loan losses is based on our current expectation for future losses, which takes into consideration historical loss experience, third-party industry forecasts, as well as other quantitative and qualitative factors addressing operational risks and industry trends. Additions to the allowance for loan losses are reflected within marketing, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The portion of loans receivable deemed uncollectible is charged off against the allowance for loan losses. Recoveries of previously charged off amounts increase the allowance for loan losses. No significant amounts of CHS Capital notes were past due as of August 31, 2023 or 2022, and the allowance for loan losses related to CHS Capital notes were not material as of either date.\nInterest Income\nInterest income is recognized on the accrual basis using a method that computes simple interest on a daily basis. Accrual of interest on commercial loans receivable is discontinued at the time the receivable is 90 days past due unless the loan is well-collateralized and in process of collection. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. Producer loans receivable are placed in nonaccrual status based on estimates and analysis due to the annual debt service terms inherent to CHS Capital's producer loans. In all cases, loans are placed in nonaccrual status or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful.\nTroubled Debt Restructurings\nRestructuring of a loan constitutes a troubled debt restructuring, or restructured loan, if the creditor, for economic reasons related to the debtor's financial difficulties, grants a concession to the debtor that it would otherwise not consider. Concessions vary by program and borrower. Concessions may include interest rate reductions, term extensions, payment deferrals or the acceptance of additional collateral in lieu of payments. In limited circumstances, principal may be forgiven. When a restructured loan constitutes a troubled debt restructuring, CHS includes these loans within its impaired loans. CHS Capital had no significant troubled debt restructurings during the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, and no third-party borrowers that accounted for more than 10% of the total CHS Capital notes receivable or total receivables as of August 31, 2023 or 2022.\nLoan Participations\nFor the years ended August 31, 2023 and 2022, CHS Capital sold $60.8 million and $64.2 million of notes receivable, respectively, to various counterparties under a master participation agreement. The sales resulted in the removal of notes receivable from the Consolidated Balance Sheets. CHS Capital has no retained interests in the transferred notes receivable, other than collection and administrative services. Proceeds from sales of notes receivable have been included in investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Fees received related to the servicing of notes receivable are recorded in other income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We consider the fees received adequate compensation for services rendered and, accordingly, have recorded no servicing asset or liability.\nOther Receivables\nOther receivables are comprised of certain other amounts recorded in the normal course of business, including receivables related to vendor rebates, value-added taxes, certain financing receivables and pre-crop financing, primarily to Brazilian farmers, to finance a portion of supplier production costs. We receive volume-based rebates from certain vendors during the year. These vendor rebates are accounted for in accordance with ASC 705, Cost of Sales and Services, based on the terms of the volume rebate program. For rebates that meet the definition of a binding arrangement and are both probable and estimable, we estimate the amount of the rebate we will receive and accrue it as a reduction of the cost of inventory and cost of goods sold over the period in which the rebate is earned. For pre-crop financing arrangements we do not bear costs or operational risks associated with the related growing crops, although our ability to be paid depends on the crops actually being produced. The financing is collateralized by future crops, land and physical assets of the farmers, carries a local market interest rate and settles when the farmer's crop is harvested and sold. No significant troubled debt restructurings occurred during the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, and no third-party customer or borrower accounted for more than 10% of the total receivables balance as of August 31, 2023 or 2022.\nNote 4 Inventories\nInventories as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, are as follows:\n2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands)\nGrain and oilseed $ 1,099,956 $ 1,133,531\nEnergy 645,333 824,114\nAgronomy 1,111,477 1,295,548\nProcessed grain and oilseed 141,360 292,992\nOther 217,053 106,686\nTotal inventories $ 3,215,179 $ 3,652,871\nGrain, processed grain, oilseed, processed oilseed and other minimally processed soy-based inventories are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 330, Inventory, and are stated at net realizable value. These inventories are agricultural commodity inventories that are readily convertible to cash because of their commodity characteristics, widely available markets and international pricing mechanisms. The net realizable value of agricultural commodity inventories is determined using inputs that are generally based on exchange traded prices and/or recent market bids and offers, including location-specific adjustments. Location-specific inputs are driven by local market supply and demand and are generally based on broker or dealer quotations or market transactions in either listed or over-the-counter (\"OTC\") markets. Changes in the net realizable value of agricultural commodity inventories are recognized in earnings as a component of cost of goods sold.\nAll other inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Costs for inventories produced or modified by us through a manufacturing process include fixed and variable production and raw material costs, and inbound freight costs for raw materials. Costs for inventories purchased for resale include the cost of products and freight incurred to place the products at our points of sale. The costs of certain energy inventories (wholesale refined products, crude oil and asphalt) are determined on the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") method; all other inventories of nongrain products purchased for resale are valued on the first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") and average cost methods.\nAs of August 31, 2023 and 2022, we valued approximately 16% and 14%, respectively, of inventories, primarily crude oil and refined fuels within our Energy segment, using the lower of cost, determined on the LIFO method, or net realizable value. If the FIFO method of accounting had been used, inventories would have been higher than the reported amount by $589.0 million and $678.3 million as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There were no liquidations of LIFO inventories during fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2022.\nNote 5 Other Current Assets\nOther current assets as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, are as follows:\n2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDerivative assets (Note 15) $ 320,119 $ 535,698\nMargin and related deposits 342,872 390,782\nPrepaid expenses 149,682 127,286\nSupplier advance payments 136,304 198,753\nRestricted cash (Note 1) 79,301 109,517\nOther 14,095 20,668\nTotal other current assets $ 1,042,373 $ 1,382,704\nMargin and Related Deposits\nMany of our derivative contracts with futures and options brokers require us to make margin deposits of cash or other assets. Subsequent margin deposits may also be necessary when changes in commodity prices result in a loss on the contract value to comply with applicable regulations. Our margin and related deposit assets are generally held in separate accounts to support the associated derivative contracts and may be used to fund or partially fund the settlement of those contracts as they expire. Similar to our derivative financial instruments, margin and related deposits are reported on a gross basis.\nPrepaid Expenses and Supplier Advance Payments\nPrepaid expenses and supplier advance payments are typically for periods less than 12 months and include amounts paid in advance for products and services. Supplier advance payments are primarily for grain purchases from suppliers and amounts paid to crop nutrient and crop protection product suppliers to lock in future supply, pricing and discounts.\nNote 6 Investments\nInvestments as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, are as follows:\n2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands)\nEquity method investments\nCF Industries Nitrogen, LLC $ 2,577,391 $ 2,641,604\nVentura Foods, LLC 519,169 410,093\nArdent Mills, LLC 265,146 250,857\nOther equity method investments 337,281 298,722\nOther investments 129,885 126,730\nTotal investments $ 3,828,872 $ 3,728,006\nJoint ventures and other investments in which we have significant ownership and influence but not control, are accounted for in our consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Our significant equity method investments consist of CF Nitrogen and Ventura Foods, LLC (\"Ventura Foods\"), which are summarized below. In addition to the recognition of our share of income from our equity method investments, our equity method investments are evaluated for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment on an ongoing basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We had approximately $636.1 million of cumulative undistributed earnings from our equity method investees included in the investments balance as of August 31, 2023.\nAll equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method are measured at fair value with changes therein reflected in net income. We have elected to use the measurement alternative for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values and measure these investments at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions. Our share in the income or loss of these equity method investments is recorded within equity income from investments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Other investments consist primarily of investments in cooperatives without readily determinable fair values and are generally recorded at cost, unless an impairment or other observable market price change occurs requiring an adjustment. Investments in other cooperatives are recorded in a manner similar to equity investments without readily determinable fair values, plus patronage dividends received in the form of capital stock and other equities. Patronage dividends are recorded as a reduction to cost of goods sold at the time qualified written notices of allocation are received. Investments in debt and equity instruments are carried at amounts that approximate fair values.\nCF Nitrogen\nWe have a $2.6 billion investment in CF Nitrogen, a strategic venture with CF Industries Holdings, Inc. The investment consists of an approximate 9% membership interest (based on product tons) in CF Nitrogen. At the time we entered into the strategic venture, we also entered into a supply agreement that entitles us to purchase up to 1.1 million tons of granular urea and 580,000 tons of urea ammonium nitrate (\"UAN\") annually from CF Nitrogen for ratable delivery through fiscal 2096. Our purchases under the supply agreement are based on prevailing market prices and we receive semiannual cash distributions (in January and July of each year) from CF Nitrogen via our membership interest. These distributions are based on actual volumes purchased from CF Nitrogen under the strategic venture and will have the effect of reducing our investment to zero over 80 years on a straight-line basis. We account for this investment using the hypothetical liquidation at book value method, recognizing our share of the earnings and losses of CF Nitrogen as equity income from investments in our Nitrogen Production segment based on our contractual claims on the entity's net assets pursuant to the liquidation provisions of the CF Nitrogen Limited Liability Company Agreement, adjusted for the semiannual cash distributions. Cash distributions received from CF Nitrogen for the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, were $458.9 million, $618.7 million and $193.9 million, respectively.\nThe following tables provide aggregate summarized financial information for CF Nitrogen for balance sheets as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, and statements of operations for the 12 months ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\n2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCurrent assets $ 899,246 $ 1,333,170\nNoncurrent assets 5,355,732 5,787,921\nCurrent liabilities 281,153 391,470\nNoncurrent liabilities 1,128 1,895\n2023 2022 2021\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNet sales $ 5,070,489 $ 6,609,758 $ 2,975,983\nGross profit 2,194,363 3,318,189 866,880\nNet earnings 2,173,715 3,249,005 809,536\nEarnings attributable to CHS Inc. 394,678 593,182 198,439\nVentura Foods\nWe have a 50% interest in Ventura Foods, a joint venture with Mitsui & Co., that produces and distributes edible oil-based products. We account for Ventura Foods as an equity method investment and our share of the results of Ventura Foods is included in Corporate and Other.\nThe following tables provide aggregate summarized financial information for our equity method investment in Ventura Foods for balance sheets as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, and statements of operations for the 12 months ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\n2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCurrent assets $ 1,041,799 $ 801,568\nNoncurrent assets 609,021 618,310\nCurrent liabilities 335,000 313,438\nNoncurrent liabilities 303,209 311,982\n2023 2022 2021\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNet sales $ 3,552,194 $ 3,386,998 $ 2,584,532\nGross profit 547,107 333,368 350,708\nNet earnings 406,271 117,666 151,196\nEarnings attributable to CHS Inc. 203,136 58,833 78,519\nOur investments in other equity method investees are not significant in relation to our consolidated financial statements, either individually or in the aggregate.\nNote 7 Property, Plant and Equipment\nMajor classes of property, plant and equipment, including finance lease assets, are summarized in the table below as of August 31, 2023 and 2022.\n2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands)\nLand and land improvements $ 350,703 $ 334,085\nBuildings 1,242,913 1,192,571\nMachinery and equipment 7,979,164 7,819,152\nOffice equipment and other 498,430 496,121\nConstruction in progress 630,542 339,043\nGross property, plant and equipment 10,701,752 10,180,972\nLess accumulated depreciation and amortization 5,832,379 5,436,013\nTotal property, plant and equipment $ 4,869,373 $ 4,744,959\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight-line method by charges to operations at rates based on the expected useful lives of individual or groups of assets (generally 15 to 20 years for land improvements, 20 to 40 years for buildings, five to 20 years for machinery and equipment, and three to 10 years for office equipment and other). Expenditures for maintenance and minor repairs and renewals are expensed. We also capitalize and amortize eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred during the application development stage. When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the related accounts and resulting gains or losses are reflected in operations.\nDepreciation expense, including amortization of finance lease assets, for the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, was $457.9 million, $458.2 million and $455.9 million, respectively.\nProperty, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This evaluation of recoverability is based on various indicators, including the nature, future economic benefits and geographic locations of the assets, historical or future profitability measures and other external market conditions. If these indicators suggest the carrying amounts of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable, potential impairment is evaluated using undiscounted, estimated future cash flows. Should the sum of the expected future net cash flows be less than the carrying value, an impairment loss would be recognized. An impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. No significant impairments were identified during fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021.\nWe have asset retirement obligations with respect to certain of our refineries and other assets due to various legal obligations to clean and/or dispose of the component parts at the time they are retired. In most cases, these assets can be used for extended and indeterminate periods of time if they are properly maintained and/or upgraded. It is our practice and current intent to maintain refineries and related assets and to continue making improvements to those assets based on technological advances. As a result, we believe our refineries and related assets have indeterminate lives for purposes of estimating asset retirement obligations because dates or ranges of dates upon which we would retire a refinery and related assets cannot reasonably be estimated at this time. When a date or range of dates can reasonably be estimated for the retirement of any component part of a refinery or other asset, we estimate the cost of performing the retirement activities and record a liability for the fair value of that future cost.\nWe have other assets that we may be obligated to dismantle at the end of corresponding lease terms subject to the lessor's discretion for which we have recorded asset retirement obligations. Based on our estimates of timing, cost and probability of removal, these obligations are not material.\nNote 8 Other Assets\nOther assets as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, are as follows:\n2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands)\nGoodwill $ 179,976 $ 179,976\nCustomer lists, trademarks and other intangible assets 46,980 53,165\nNotes receivable (Note 3) 76,919 46,012\nLong-term derivative assets (Note 15) 1,119 8,546\nPrepaid pension and other benefits (Note 13) 78,819 74,810\nCapitalized major maintenance 289,377 147,521\nCash value life insurance 134,126 128,876\nOperating lease right of use assets (Note 19) 254,844 242,859\nOther 68,364 92,230\nTotal other assets $ 1,130,524 $ 973,995\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill is assessed for impairment on an annual basis as of July 31, either by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary or by proceeding directly to the quantitative test. The quantitative test may be required more frequently if triggering events or other circumstances occur that could indicate impairment. Goodwill is assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level, which has been determined to be our operating segments or one level below our operating segments in certain instances.\nThere were no changes in the net carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended August 31, 2023. Changes in the net carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended August 31, 2022, by segment, are as follows:\nEnergy Ag Corporate\nand Other Total\n(Dollars in thousands)\nBalances, August 31, 2021 $ 552 $ 160,475 $ 10,574 $ 171,601\nGoodwill acquired during the period 8,906 - - 8,906\nGoodwill disposed of during the period - (531) - (531)\nBalances, August 31, 2022 $ 9,458 $ 159,944 $ 10,574 $ 179,976\nNo goodwill has been allocated to our Nitrogen Production segment, which consists of a single investment accounted for under the equity method of accounting, and allocated expenses.\nNo goodwill impairments were identified as a result of our annual goodwill analyses performed as of July 31, 2023, 2022 or 2021. Management will continue to monitor the results and projected cash flows for each of our businesses to assess whether any reserves or impairments may be necessary in the future.\nIntangible assets subject to amortization primarily include customer lists, trademarks and noncompete agreements, and are amortized over their respective useful lives (ranging from two to 30 years). We have no material intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. All long-lived assets, including other identifiable intangible assets, are also assessed for impairment in accordance with U.S. GAAP and evaluated for impairment whenever triggering events or other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset group or reporting unit may not be recoverable. Information regarding intangible assets is as follows:\nAugust 31, 2023 August 31, 2022\nCarrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCustomer lists $ 85,341 $ (41,374) $ 43,967 $ 84,565 $ (35,280) $ 49,285\nTrademarks and other intangible assets 11,332 (8,319) 3,013 11,902 (8,022) 3,880\nTotal intangible assets $ 96,673 $ (49,693) $ 46,980 $ 96,467 $ (43,302) $ 53,165\nIntangible asset amortization expense for the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, was $6.7 million, $6.8 million and $6.9 million, respectively. The estimated annual amortization expense related to intangible assets subject to amortization for future years is as follows:\n(Dollars in thousands)\n2024 $ 6,631\n2025 6,415\n2026 6,233\n2027 6,178\n2028 6,178\nThereafter 15,345\nTotal $ 46,980\nCapitalized Major Maintenance\nActivity related to capitalized major maintenance costs at our refineries for the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, is summarized below:\nBalance at\nBeginning\nof Year Cost\nDeferred Amortization Balance at\nEnd of Year\n(Dollars in thousands)\n2023 $ 147,521 $ 216,762 $ (74,906) $ 289,377\n2022 196,641 25,401 (74,521) 147,521\n2021 228,511 41,899 (73,769) 196,641\nWithin our Energy segment, major maintenance activities are regularly performed at our Laurel, Montana, and McPherson, Kansas, refineries. Major maintenance activities are the planned and required shutdowns of refinery processing units, which include replacement or overhaul of equipment that has experienced decreased efficiency in resource conversion. Because major maintenance activities are performed to extend the life, increase the capacity and/or improve the safety or efficiency of refinery processing assets, we follow the deferral method of accounting for major maintenance activities. Expenditures for major maintenance activities are capitalized (deferred) when incurred and amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of two to five years, which is the estimated time lapse between major maintenance activities. Should the estimated time between major maintenance activities change, we may be required to amortize the remaining cost of the major maintenance activities over a shorter period, which would result in higher depreciation and amortization costs. Amortization expense related to the capitalized major maintenance costs is included in cost of goods sold in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nSelection of the deferral method, as opposed to expensing major maintenance activity costs when incurred, results in deferring recognition of major maintenance activity expenditures. The deferral method also results in classification of related cash outflows as investing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, whereas expensing these costs as incurred would result in classifying the cash outflows as operating activities. Repair, maintenance and related labor costs are expensed as incurred and are included in operating cash flows.\nNote 9 Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt\nOur notes payable and long-term debt are subject to various restrictive requirements for maintenance of minimum consolidated net worth and other financial ratios. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of August 31, 2023.\nNotes Payable\nNotes payable as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, consisted of the following:\nWeighted-average Interest Rate\n2023 2022 2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNotes payable 5.37% 4.41% $ 375,932 $ 459,398\nCHS Capital notes payable 4.24% 1.34% 171,991 147,321\nTotal notes payable $ 547,923 $ 606,719\nOn April 21, 2023, we amended and restated our primary line of credit, which is a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of domestic and international banks. The credit facility provides a committed amount of $2.8 billion that expires on April 21, 2028. There were no borrowings outstanding on this facility as of August 31, 2023. We also maintain certain uncommitted bilateral facilities to support our working capital needs.\nIn addition to our facilities referenced above, our wholly-owned subsidiaries, CHS Europe S.a.r.l. and CHS Agronegocio Industria e Comercio Ltda have lines of credit with $185.9 million outstanding as of August 31, 2023, and our other international subsidiaries have lines of credit with $188.5 million outstanding as of August 31, 2023.\nCHS Capital Notes Payable\nWe have a receivables and loans securitization facility (\"Securitization Facility\") with certain unaffiliated financial institutions (\"Purchasers\"). Under the Securitization Facility, we and certain of our subsidiaries (\"Originators\") sell trade accounts and notes receivable (\"Receivables\") to Cofina Funding, LLC (\"Cofina\"), a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote, indirect subsidiary of CHS. Cofina in turn transfers the Receivables to the Purchasers, and this arrangement is accounted for as secured financing. We use the proceeds from the sale of Receivables under the Securitization Facility for general corporate purposes, and settlements are made on a monthly basis. The amount available under the Securitization Facility fluctuates over time based on the total amount of eligible Receivables generated during the normal course of business. The Securitization Facility consists of a committed portion with a maximum availability of $850.0 million and an uncommitted portion with a maximum availability of $250.0 million. As of August 31, 2023, total availability under the Securitization Facility was $950.2 million, of which no amount was utilized.\nOn July 11, 2023, we amended the Securitization Facility and entered into a repurchase facility (\"Repurchase Facility\"), under which we can obtain repurchase agreement financing up to $200.0 million for certain eligible receivables and notes receivables of the Originators. The amendments to the Securitization Facility were designed to remove from the securitization certain receivables and notes receivables to permit them to be sold under the Repurchase Facility. On August 29, 2023 the Securitization Facility was further amended to extend the term of the agreement and update pricing. No balance was outstanding under this Repurchase Facility as of August 31, 2023.\nCHS Capital sells loan commitments it has originated to Compeer Financial, PCA, d/b/a ProPartners Financial on a recourse basis. The total commitments under the program were $100.0 million; however, no amounts were borrowed under these commitments as of August 31, 2023.\nCHS Capital borrows funds under short-term notes issued as part of a surplus funds program. Borrowings under this program are unsecured and are due upon demand. Borrowings under these notes totaled $172.0 million as of August 31, 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nDuring the year ended August 31, 2023, we repaid approximately $283.0 million of long-term debt. On January 24, 2023, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement to borrow $150.0 million of long-term debt in the form of a note. Amounts included in long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, are presented in the table below:\n2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands)\n4.67% unsecured notes $130 million face amount, due in fiscal 2023\n$ - $ 130,000\n4.39% unsecured notes $152 million face amount, due in fiscal 2023\n- 152,000\n3.85% unsecured notes $80 million face amount, due in fiscal 2025\n80,000 80,000\n3.80% unsecured notes $100 million face amount, due in fiscal 2025\n100,000 100,000\n4.58% unsecured notes $150 million face amount, due in fiscal 2025\n150,000 150,000\n4.82% unsecured notes $80 million face amount, due in fiscal 2026\n80,000 80,000\n4.69% unsecured notes $58 million face amount, due in fiscal 2027\n58,000 58,000\n3.24% unsecured notes $95 million face amount, due in fiscal 2028\n95,000 95,000\n4.74% unsecured notes $95 million face amount, due in fiscal 2028\n95,000 95,000\n5.68% unsecured notes $150 million face amount, due in fiscal 2030\n150,000 -\n3.48% unsecured notes $100 million face amount, due in fiscal 2031\n100,000 100,000\n4.89% unsecured notes $100 million face amount, due in fiscal 2031\n100,000 100,000\n3.58% unsecured notes $65 million face amount, due in fiscal 2033\n65,000 65,000\n4.71% unsecured notes $100 million face amount, due in fiscal 2033\n100,000 100,000\n3.73% unsecured notes $115 million face amount, due in fiscal 2036\n115,000 115,000\n5.40% unsecured notes $125 million face amount, due in fiscal 2036\n125,000 125,000\nPrivate placement debt 1,413,000 1,545,000\n6.93% unsecured term loan from cooperative and other banks, due in fiscal 2026 (a)\n366,000 366,000\nTerm loan 366,000 366,000\nFinance lease liabilities 49,235 44,773\nDeferred financing costs (3,127) (3,535)\nOther, including notes and contracts with interest rates from 4.0% to 9.0%\n2,550 6,576\nTotal long-term debt 1,827,658 1,958,814\nLess current portion 7,839 290,605\nLong-term portion $ 1,819,819 $ 1,668,209\n(a) Borrowings are variable under the agreement and bear interest at a base rate plus an applicable margin.\nAs of August 31, 2023, the fair value of our long-term debt is estimated to be $1.6 billion based on quoted market prices of similar debt (a Level 2 fair value measurement based on the classification hierarchy of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement).\nLong-term debt outstanding as of August 31, 2023, has aggregate maturities, excluding fair value adjustments and finance leases (see Note 19, Leases, for a schedule of minimum future lease payments under finance leases), as follows:\n(Dollars in thousands)\n2024 $ 1,060\n2025 330,187\n2026 446,020\n2027 58,021\n2028 190,000\nThereafter 755,000\nTotal $ 1,780,288\nInterest expense for the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, was $137.4 million, $114.2 million and $104.6 million, respectively, net of capitalized interest of $14.0 million, $6.1 million and $8.0 million, respectively.\nNote 10 Other Current Liabilities\nOther current liabilities as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, are as follows:\n2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCustomer margin deposits and credit balances $ 197,315 $ 283,234\nCustomer advance payments 356,760 525,003\nDerivative liabilities (Note 15) 355,696 398,781\nDividends and equity payable (Note 12) 730,000 1,000,000\nTotal other current liabilities $ 1,639,771 $ 2,207,018\nNote 11 Income Taxes\nCHS is a nonexempt agricultural cooperative and files a consolidated federal income tax return within our tax return period. We are subject to tax on income from nonpatronage sources, nonqualified patronage distributions and undistributed patronage-sourced income. Income tax expense (benefit) is primarily the current tax payable for the period and the change during the period in certain deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities recognized under U.S. GAAP and such amounts recognized for federal and state income tax purposes, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.\nThe provision for (benefit from) income taxes for the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows:\n2023 2022 2021\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCurrent:\nFederal $ 66,672 $ 56,582 $ (533)\nState 36,925 24,224 2,943\nForeign 3,735 9,833 56\nTotal current 107,332 90,639 2,466\nDeferred:\nFederal 7,799 41,710 (24,676)\nState (7,661) 491 (15,666)\nForeign 185 (724) (373)\nTotal deferred 323 41,477 (40,715)\nTotal $ 107,655 $ 132,116 $ (38,249)\nDomestic income before income taxes was $2.0 billion, $1.8 billion and $497.5 million for the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Foreign income (loss) before income taxes was $55.4 million, ($4.9) million and $17.8 million for the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, are as follows:\n2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDeferred tax assets:\nAccrued expenses $ 51,960 $ 61,843\nPostretirement health care and deferred compensation 51,635 46,008\nTax credit carryforwards 97,730 101,457\nLoss carryforwards 111,963 110,018\nNonqualified equity 467,519 424,869\nLease obligations 62,225 60,329\nOther 43,164 95,027\nDeferred tax assets valuation allowance (182,466) (189,685)\nTotal deferred tax assets 703,730 709,866\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nPension costs 10,596 14,600\nInvestments 129,683 169,970\nProperty, plant and equipment 625,403 605,463\nLease right of use assets 60,501 58,852\nTotal deferred tax liabilities 826,183 848,885\nNet deferred tax liabilities $ 122,453 $ 139,019\nWe had total gross loss carryforwards of $587.3 million, as of August 31, 2023, of which $344.4 million will expire over periods ranging from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2043. The remainder will carry forward indefinitely. Based on estimates of future taxable profits and losses in certain foreign tax jurisdictions, as well as consideration of other factors, we assessed whether a valuation allowance was necessary to reduce specific foreign loss carryforwards to amounts we believe are more likely than not to be realized as of August 31, 2023. If our estimates prove inaccurate, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required in the future with gains or losses being charged to income in the period such determination is made. Our McPherson refinery's gross state tax credit carryforwards for income tax were approximately $116.6 million and $122.8 million as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The refinery's valuation allowance on Kansas state credits is necessary due to the limited amount of taxable income generated in Kansas by the combined group on an annual basis. Our state tax credits of $116.6 million will begin to expire during fiscal 2024.\nThe reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rates to the effective tax rates for the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows:\n2023 2022 2021\nStatutory federal income tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %\nState and local income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit 1.1 1.1 (2.6)\nPatronage earnings (13.0) (13.6) (11.4)\nDomestic production activities deduction (3.2) (3.2) (8.2)\nExport activities at rates other than the U.S. statutory rate (0.2) 0.4 0.5\nIntercompany transfer of business assets - (0.1) (4.7)\nIncrease in unrecognized tax benefits - - 0.8\nValuation allowance - 0.2 (0.2)\nOther (0.3) 1.5 (2.6)\nEffective tax rate 5.4 % 7.3 % (7.4) %\nPrimary drivers of fiscal 2023 and 2022 income tax expense were increased nonpatronage earnings and other nondeductible items, which were partially offset by the current Domestic Production Activities Deduction (\"DPAD\") benefit. Primary drivers of the fiscal 2021 income tax benefit were retaining the current DPAD benefit and from tax planning associated with certain assets.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. Our uncertain tax positions are affected by the tax years that are under audit or remain subject to examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Fiscal years 2007 through 2019 remain subject to examination for certain issues.\nReserves are recorded against unrecognized tax benefits when we believe certain fully supportable tax return positions are likely to be challenged and we may or may not prevail. If we determine that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, based on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the benefit by measuring the amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. We reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit, or derecognize a previously recorded tax benefit, when there is (i) completion of a tax audit, (ii) effective settlement of an issue, (iii) a change in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance, or (iv) expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves. A reconciliation of the gross beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits for the periods is presented as follows:\n2023 2022 2021\n(Dollars in thousands)\nBalance at beginning of period $ 124,959 $ 122,149 $ 119,150\nAdditions attributable to current year tax positions - - 2,000\nAdditions attributable to prior year tax positions 894 2,810 15,974\nReductions attributable to prior year tax positions - - (14,975)\nBalance at end of period $ 125,853 $ 124,959 $ 122,149\nIf we were to prevail on all positions taken in relation to uncertain tax positions, $116.0 million of the unrecognized tax benefits would ultimately benefit our effective tax rate. It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months.\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our provision for income taxes. We recognized benefits of $0.8 million, $0.7 million and $1.4 million for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and a related $3.7 million and $3.3 million interest payable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nNote 12 Equities\nPatronage and Equity Redemptions\nIn accordance with our bylaws and by action of the Board of Directors, annual net earnings from patronage sources are distributed to consenting patrons following the close of each fiscal year and are based on amounts using financial statement earnings. The cash portion of the qualified patronage distribution, if any, is determined annually by the Board of Directors, with the balance issued in the form of qualified and/or nonqualified capital equity certificates. Total patronage distributions for fiscal 2023 are estimated to be $1.2 billion, with the qualified cash portion estimated to be $365.0 million, estimated qualified equity distributions of $706.1 million and estimated nonqualified equity distributions of $169.2 million.\nThe following table presents estimated patronage distributions for the year ending August 31, 2023, and actual patronage distributions for the years ended August 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020:\n2024 2023 2022 2021\n(Dollars in millions)\nPatronage distributed in cash $ 365.0 $ 503.1 $ 51.0 $ 30.0\nPatronage distributed in equity 875.3 670.9 235.6 214.8\nTotal patronage distributed $ 1,240.3 $ 1,174.0 $ 286.6 $ 244.8\nAnnual net earnings from patronage or other sources may be added to the unallocated capital reserve or, upon action by the Board of Directors, may be allocated to members in the form of nonpatronage equity certificates. The Board of Directors authorized, in accordance with our bylaws, that 10% of the earnings from patronage business for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 be added to our capital reserves.\nRedemptions of outstanding equity are at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Redemptions of capital equity certificates approved by the Board of Directors are divided into two pools, one for nonindividuals (primarily member cooperatives) who may participate in an annual redemption program for qualified equities held by them and another for individual members who are eligible for equity redemptions at age 70 or upon death. In accordance with authorization from the Board of Directors, we expect total redemptions related to the year ended August 31, 2023, which will be distributed in fiscal 2024, to be approximately $365.0 million. This amount is classified as a current liability on our August 31, 2023, Consolidated Balance Sheet. During the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we redeemed in cash, outstanding owners' equities in accordance with authorization from the Board of Directors, in the amounts of $495.8 million, $111.8 million and $79.4 million, respectively.\nPreferred Stock\nThe following is a summary of our outstanding preferred stock as of August 31, 2023, all shares of which are listed and traded on the Global Select Market of The Nasdaq:\nNasdaq Symbol Issuance Date Shares Outstanding Redemption Value Net Proceeds (a) Dividend Rate\n(b) (c) Dividend Payment Frequency Redeemable Beginning (d)\n(Dollars in millions)\n8% Cumulative Redeemable CHSCP (e) 12,272,003 $ 306.8 $ 311.2 8.00 % Quarterly 7/18/2023\nClass B Cumulative Redeemable, Series 1 CHSCO (f) 21,459,066 536.5 569.3 7.875 % Quarterly 9/26/2023\nClass B Reset Rate Cumulative Redeemable, Series 2 CHSCN 3/11/2014 16,800,000 420.0 406.2 7.10 % Quarterly 3/31/2024\nClass B Reset Rate Cumulative Redeemable, Series 3 CHSCM 9/15/2014 19,700,000 492.5 476.7 6.75 % Quarterly 9/30/2024\nClass B Cumulative Redeemable, Series 4 CHSCL 1/21/2015 20,700,000 517.5 501.0 7.50 % Quarterly 1/21/2025\n(a) Includes patron equities redeemed with preferred stock.\n(b) The Class B Reset Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, Series 2 accumulates dividends at a rate of 7.10% per year until March 31, 2024, and then at a rate equal to the three-month benchmark interest rate plus 4.298%, not to exceed 8.00% per annum, subsequent to March 31, 2024.\n(c) The Class B Reset Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, Series 3 accumulates dividends at a rate of 6.75% per year until September 30, 2024, and then at a rate equal to the three-month benchmark interest rate plus 4.155%, not to exceed 8.00% per annum, subsequent to September 30, 2024.\n(d) Preferred stock is redeemable for cash at our option, in whole or in part, at a per share price equal to the per share liquidation preference of $25.00 per share, plus all dividends accumulated and unpaid on that share to and including the date of redemption, beginning on the dates set forth in this column.\n(e) The 8% Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock was issued at various times from 2003 through 2010.\n(f) Shares of Class B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, Series 1 were issued on September 26, 2013; August 25, 2014; March 31, 2016; and March 30, 2017.\nPreferred Stock Dividends\nWe made dividend payments on our preferred stock of $168.7 million during each of the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.

Pension and other postretirement reclassifications include amortization of net actuarial loss, prior service credit and transition amounts and are recorded as cost of goods sold and marketing, general and administrative expenses (see Note 13, Benefit Plans, for further information). As described in Note 15, Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities, amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss for cash flow hedges are recorded in cost of goods sold. Gains or losses on foreign currency translation reclassifications are recorded in other income.\nNote 13 Benefit Plans\nWe have various pension and other defined benefits as well as defined contribution plans in which substantially all employees may participate. We also have nonqualified supplemental executive and Board retirement plans. We provide defined life insurance and health care benefits for certain retired employees and Board of Directors participants. The plan is contributory based on years of service and family status, with retiree contributions adjusted annually.\nFinancial information on changes in projected benefit obligation, plan assets funded and balance sheet status as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, is as follows:\nQualified\nPension Benefits Nonqualified\nPension Benefits Other Benefits\n2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands)\nChange in benefit obligation:\nProjected benefit obligation at beginning of period $ 759,173 $ 925,239 $ 18,257 $ 20,604 $ 24,524 $ 29,069\nService cost 38,579 46,275 1,840 926 670 996\nInterest cost 30,588 17,167 741 281 1,035 503\nActuarial loss (gain):\nExperience study and mortality updates 2,573 2,941 159 43 - 19\nOther demographic experience* 5,181 9,875 1,999 1,313 (553) 717\nDiscount rate change (45,216) (164,543) (876) (2,892) (1,312) (4,979)\nPlan amendments 490 132 - - - -\nSettlements - - - (1,327) - -\nBenefits paid (82,857) (77,913) (1,140) (691) (1,792) (1,801)\nProjected benefit obligation at end of period $ 708,511 $ 759,173 $ 20,980 $ 18,257 $ 22,572 $ 24,524\nChange in plan assets:\nFair value of plan assets at beginning of period $ 787,422 $ 993,124 $ - $ - $ - $ -\nActual (loss) gain on plan assets (8,415) (166,789) - - - -\nCompany contributions 40,000 39,000 1,140 2,018 1,792 1,801\nBenefits paid (82,857) (77,913) (1,140) (2,018) (1,792) (1,801)\nFair value of plan assets at end of period $ 736,150 $ 787,422 $ - $ - $ - $ -\nFunded status at end of period $ 27,639 $ 28,249 $ (20,980) $ (18,257) $ (22,572) $ (24,524)\nAmounts recognized on balance sheet:\nNoncurrent assets $ 27,639 $ 28,249 $ - $ - $ - $ -\nAccrued benefit cost:\nCurrent liabilities - - (2,880) (2,300) (2,170) (2,290)\nNoncurrent liabilities - - (18,100) (15,957) (20,402) (22,234)\nEnding balance $ 27,639 $ 28,249 $ (20,980) $ (18,257) $ (22,572) $ (24,524)\nAmounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss (pretax):\nPrior service cost (credit) $ 1,172 $ 831 $ (160) $ (274) $ (1,380) $ (1,825)\nNet loss (gain) 247,609 235,399 4,294 3,257 (18,096) (17,846)\nEnding balance $ 248,781 $ 236,230 $ 4,134 $ 2,983 $ (19,476) $ (19,671)\n*Other demographic experience is comprised of all demographic experience different than anticipated, including terminations, retirements, deaths, pay, etc.\nThe accumulated benefit obligation of the qualified pension plans was $678.4 million and $728.9 million as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

We use a full-yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. The discount rate reflects the rate at which the associated benefits could be effectively settled as of the measurement date. In estimating this rate, we look at rates of return on fixed-income investments of similar duration to the liabilities in the plans that receive high investment-grade ratings by recognized ratings agencies.\nAn annual analysis of the risk versus the return of the investment portfolio is conducted to justify the expected long-term rate of return assumption. We generally use long-term historical return information for the targeted asset mix identified in asset and liability studies. Adjustments are made to the expected long-term rate of return assumption when deemed necessary, based upon revised expectations of future investment performance of the overall investment markets.\nFor measurement purposes, a 7.5% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for the year ended August 31, 2023. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.5% by 2031 and remain at that level thereafter. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:\n1% Increase 1% Decrease\n(Dollars in thousands)\nEffect on total of service and interest cost components $ 170 $ 140\nEffect on postretirement benefit obligation 1,400 1,300\nContributions depend primarily on market returns on the pension plan assets and minimum funding level requirements. During fiscal 2023, we made a discretionary contribution of $40.0 million to the pension plans. Based on the funded status of the qualified pension plans as of August 31, 2023, we do not currently believe we will be required to contribute to these plans in fiscal 2024, although we may voluntarily elect to do so. We expect to pay $5.1 million to participants of the nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans during fiscal 2024.\nOur retiree benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are anticipated to be paid as follows:\nQualified\nPension Benefits Nonqualified\nPension Benefits Other Benefits\n(Dollars in thousands)\n2024 $ 69,100 $ 2,880 $ 2,170\n2025 69,600 3,020 2,280\n2026 69,800 2,800 2,220\n2027 71,200 2,480 2,180\n2028 74,200 2,160 2,060\n2029-2033 339,800 8,380 8,570\nWe have trusts that hold the assets for the defined benefit plans. CHS has a qualified plan committee that sets investment guidelines with the assistance of external consultants. Investment objectives for the plans' assets are as follows:\nOptimize the long-term returns on plan assets at an acceptable level of risk;\nMaintain broad diversification across asset classes and among investment managers; and\nFocus on long-term return objectives.\nAsset allocation targets promote optimal expected return and volatility characteristics given the long-term time horizon for fulfilling the obligations of the pension plans. The investment portfolio contains a diversified portfolio of investment categories, including equities, fixed-income securities and real estate. Securities are also diversified in terms of domestic and international securities, short- and long-term securities, growth and value equities, large and small cap stocks, as well as active and passive management styles. Our pension plans' investment policy strategy is such that liabilities match assets. This is being accomplished through the asset portfolio mix by reducing volatility and de-risking the plans. The plans' target allocation percentages range between 45% and 80% for fixed income securities and range between 20% and 55% for equity securities.\nThe qualified plan committee believes that with prudent risk tolerance and asset diversification, the plans should be able to meet pension obligations in the future.\nOur pension plans' recurring fair value measurements by asset category as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, are presented in the tables below:\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 12,505 $ - $ - $ 12,505\nEquities:\nCommon/collective trust at net asset value (1)\n- - - 127,225\nFixed income securities:\nOther investments 25,143 86,315 - 111,458\nCommon/collective trust at net asset value (1)\n- - - 425,180\nPartnership and joint venture interests measured at net asset value (1)\n- - - 59,782\nTotal $ 37,648 $ 86,315 $ - $ 736,150\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 7,472 $ - $ - $ 7,472\nEquities:\nCommon/collective trust at net asset value (1)\n- - - 142,730\nFixed income securities:\nCommon/collective trust at net asset value (1)\n- - - 550,046\nPartnership and joint venture interests measured at net asset value (1)\n- - - 87,174\nTotal $ 7,472 $ - $ - $ 787,422\n(1) In accordance with ASC Topic 820-10, Fair Value Measurement, certain assets that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in the tables above are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the \"Financial information on changes in projected benefit obligation, plan assets funded and balance sheet status\" table above.\nDefinitions for valuation levels are found in Note 16, Fair Value Measurements. We use the following valuation methodologies for assets measured at fair value:\nCommon/collective trusts. Common/collective trusts primarily consist of equity and fixed income funds and are valued using other significant observable inputs, including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risks, referenced indices, quoted prices in inactive markets, adjusted quoted prices in active markets, adjusted quoted prices on foreign equity securities that were adjusted in accordance with pricing procedures approved by the trust, etc.\nCommon/collective trust investments can be redeemed daily and without restriction. Redemption of the entire investment balance generally requires a 45- to 60-day notice period. The equity funds provide exposure to large-, mid- and small-cap U.S. equities, international large- and small-cap equities and emerging market equities. The fixed income funds provide exposure to U.S., international and emerging market debt securities.\nOther investments. Other investments are comprised primarily of investments in various government agency obligations and U.S. Treasury securities which are valued using quoted market prices and classified within Level 1, as well as corporate, foreign government, and municipal issue fixed income marketable securities which are valued using institutional bond or broker quotes along with various other market and industry inputs and classified within Level 2.\nPartnership and joint venture interests. The net asset value of shares held by the plan at year-end is used to value these assets as a practical expedient for fair value. The net asset value is based on the fair value of the underlying assets owned by the trust, minus its liabilities, then divided by the number of units outstanding. Redemptions of these interests generally require a 45- to 60-day notice period.\nWe are one of approximately 400 employers contributing to the Co-op Retirement Plan (\"Co-op Plan\"), which is a defined benefit plan constituting a multiple employer plan under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and a multiemployer plan under the accounting standards. The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans in the following aspects:\nAssets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers;\nIf a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers; and\nIf we choose to stop participating in the multiemployer plan, we may be required to pay the plan an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability. The withdrawal liability associated with the multiemployer plan was approximately $22.7 million as of August 31, 2023.\nOur participation in the Co-op Plan for the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, is outlined in the table below:\nContributions of CHS\n(Dollars in thousands)\nPlan Name EIN/Plan Number 2023 2022 2021 Surcharge Imposed Expiration Date of Collective Bargaining Agreement\nCo-op Retirement Plan 01-0689331 / 001 $ 1,017 $ 955 $ 1,172 N/A N/A\nOur contributions for the years stated above did not represent more than 5% of total contributions to the Co-op Plan as indicated in the Co-op Plan's most recently available annual report (Form 5500).\nProvisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (\"PPA\") do not apply to the Co-op Plan because there is a special exemption for cooperative plans if the plan is maintained by more than one employer and at least 85% of the employers are rural cooperatives or cooperative organizations owned by agricultural producers. In the Co-op Plan, a zone status determination is not required, and therefore not determined. In addition, the accumulated benefit obligations and plan assets are not determined or allocated separately by individual employers. The most recent financial statements available in 2023 and 2022 are for the Co-op Plan's year-end at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In total, the Co-op Plan was at least 80% funded on those dates based on the total plan assets and accumulated benefit obligations.\nBecause the provisions of the PPA do not apply to the Co-op Plan, funding improvement plans and surcharges are not applicable. Future contribution requirements are determined each year as part of the actuarial valuation of the plan and may change as a result of plan experience.\nIn addition to the contributions to the Co-op Plan listed above, total contributions to individually insignificant multiemployer pension plans were immaterial in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nWe have other contributory defined contribution plans covering substantially all employees. Total contributions by us to these plans were $38.7 million, $35.0 million and $30.1 million, for the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNote 14 Segment Reporting\nWe are an integrated agricultural cooperative, providing grain, food, agronomy and energy resources to businesses and consumers on a global basis. We provide a wide variety of products and services, from initial agricultural inputs such as fuels, farm supplies, crop nutrients and crop protection products, to agricultural outputs that include grain and oilseed, processed grain and oilseed, renewable fuels and food products. We define our operating segments in accordance with ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, to reflect the manner in which our chief operating decision maker, our Chief Executive Officer, evaluates performance and allocates resources in managing the business. We have aggregated those operating segments into three reportable segments: Energy, Ag and Nitrogen Production.\nOur Energy segment produces and provides primarily for the wholesale distribution of petroleum products and transportation of those products. Our Ag segment purchases and further processes or resells grain and oilseed originated by our country operations business, by our member cooperatives and by third parties; serves as a wholesaler and retailer of crop inputs; and produces and markets ethanol. Our Nitrogen Production segment consists of our equity method investment in CF Nitrogen and allocated expenses. Our supply agreement with CF Nitrogen entitles us to purchase up to a specified quantity of granular urea and UAN annually from CF Nitrogen. Corporate and Other represents our financing and hedging businesses, which primarily consists of a U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission-regulated futures commission merchant (\"FCM\") for commodities hedging and financial services related to crop production. Our nonconsolidated investments in Ventura Foods and Ardent Mills, LLC (\"Ardent Mills\") are also included in our Corporate and Other category.\nCorporate administrative expenses and interest are allocated to each reportable segment and Corporate and Other, based on direct use of services, such as information technology and legal, and other factors or considerations relevant to the costs incurred.\nMany of our business activities are highly seasonal and our operating results vary throughout the year. Our revenues and IBIT generally trend lower during the second fiscal quarter and increase in the third fiscal quarter. For example, in our Ag segment, our country operations business generally experiences higher volumes and revenues during the fall harvest and spring planting seasons, which generally correspond to our first and third fiscal quarters, respectively. Additionally, our agronomy business generally experiences higher volumes and revenues during the spring planting season. Our global grain and processing operations are subject to fluctuations in volume and revenues based on producer harvests, world grain prices, demand and international trade relationships. Our Energy segment generally experiences higher volumes and revenues in certain operating areas, such as refined products, in the spring, summer and early fall when gasoline and diesel fuel use by agricultural producers is highest and is subject to global supply and demand forces. Other energy products, such as propane, generally experience higher volumes and revenues during the winter heating and fall crop-drying seasons.\nOur revenues, assets and cash flows can be significantly affected by global market prices for commodities such as petroleum products, natural gas, grain, oilseed, crop nutrients and flour. Changes in market prices for commodities that we purchase without a corresponding change in the selling prices of those products can affect revenues and operating earnings. Commodity prices are affected by a wide range of factors beyond our control, including weather, crop damage due to plant disease or insects, drought, availability and adequacy of supply, availability of reliable rail and river transportation networks, outbreaks of disease, government regulations and policies, global trade disputes, wars and civil unrest, and general political and economic conditions.\nWhile our revenues and operating results are derived primarily from businesses and operations that are wholly-owned or subsidiaries and limited liability companies in which we have a controlling interest, a portion of our business operations are conducted through companies in which we hold ownership interests of 50% or less or do not control the operations. We account for these investments primarily using the equity method of accounting, wherein we record our proportionate share of income or loss reported by the entity as equity income from investments, without consolidating the revenues and expenses of the entity in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. In our Ag segment, this includes our 50% interest in TEMCO, LLC (\"TEMCO\"). In our Nitrogen Production segment, this consists of our approximate 9% membership interest (based on product tons) in CF Nitrogen. In Corporate and Other, this principally includes our 50% ownership in Ventura Foods and our 12% ownership in Ardent Mills.

Except for certain cash-settled swaps related to future crude oil purchases and refined product sales, which are accounted for as cash flow hedges, our derivative instruments represent economic hedges of price risk for which hedge accounting under ASC Topic 815 is not applied. Rather, the derivative instruments are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with changes in fair value being recorded directly to earnings, primarily within cost of goods sold in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 16, Fair Value Measurements, for additional information. The majority of our exchange traded agricultural commodity futures are settled daily through CHS Hedging, LLC, our wholly-owned FCM.\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments\nThe following tables present the gross fair values of derivative assets, derivative liabilities and related margin deposits (cash collateral) recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, along with related amounts permitted to be offset in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Although we have certain netting arrangements for our exchange-traded futures and options contracts and certain OTC contracts, we have elected to report our derivative instruments on a gross basis on our Consolidated Balance Sheets under ASC Topic 210-20, Balance Sheet - Offsetting.\nAugust 31, 2023\nAmounts Not Offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet but Eligible for Offsetting\nGross Amounts Recognized Cash Collateral Derivative Instruments Net Amounts\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDerivative assets\nCommodity derivatives $ 280,440 $ - $ 4,866 $ 275,574\nForeign exchange derivatives 32,402 - 12,330 20,072\nTotal $ 312,842 $ - $ 17,196 $ 295,646\nDerivative liabilities\nCommodity derivatives $ 349,131 $ 1,505 $ 4,866 $ 342,760\nForeign exchange derivatives 13,799 - 12,330 1,469\nTotal $ 362,930 $ 1,505 $ 17,196 $ 344,229\nAugust 31, 2022\nAmounts Not Offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet but Eligible for Offsetting\nGross Amounts Recognized Cash Collateral Derivative Instruments Net Amounts\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDerivative assets\nCommodity derivatives $ 464,167 $ - $ 3,834 $ 460,333\nForeign exchange derivatives 52,923 - 8,901 44,022\nTotal $ 517,090 $ - $ 12,735 $ 504,355\nDerivative liabilities\nCommodity derivatives $ 378,291 $ 1,424 $ 12,574 $ 364,293\nForeign exchange derivatives 12,649 - 8,901 3,748\nTotal $ 390,940 $ 1,424 $ 21,475 $ 368,041\nDerivative assets and liabilities with maturities of less than 12 months are recorded in other current assets and other current liabilities, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Derivative assets and liabilities with maturities greater than 12 months are recorded in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount of long-term derivative assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, was $1.1 million and $8.5 million, respectively. The amount of long-term derivative liabilities recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, was $12.6 million and $4.0 million, respectively.\nThe following table sets forth the pretax (losses) gains on derivatives not accounted for as hedging instruments that have been included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\nDerivative Type Location of\n(Loss) Gain 2023 2022 2021\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCommodity derivatives Cost of goods sold $ (360,937) $ (568,877) $ (971,581)\nForeign exchange derivatives Cost of goods sold (30,898) 9,587 25,277\nForeign exchange derivatives Marketing, general and administrative expenses (530) 577 1,105\nOther derivatives Other income - 2,057 2,489\nTotal $ (392,365) $ (556,656) $ (942,710)\nCommodity Contracts\nWhen we enter into a commodity purchase or sales commitment, we incur risks related to price changes and performance, including delivery, quality, quantity and shipment period. In the event that market prices decrease, we are exposed to risk of loss for the market value of inventory and purchase contracts with fixed or partially fixed prices. Conversely, we are exposed to risk of loss on our fixed- or partially fixed-price sales contracts in the event that market prices increase.\nOur use of hedging reduces exposure to price volatility by protecting against adverse short-term price movements but also limits the benefits of favorable short-term price movements. To reduce the price risk associated with fixed-price commitments, we generally enter into commodity derivative contracts, to the extent practical, to achieve a net commodity position within the formal position limits we have established and deemed prudent for each commodity. These contracts are primarily transacted through our FCM on regulated commodity futures exchanges, but may include OTC derivative instruments when deemed appropriate. These contracts are recorded at fair values based on quotes listed on regulated commodity exchanges or the market prices of the underlying products listed on the exchanges, except that certain contracts are accounted for as normal purchase and normal sales transactions. For commodities where there is no liquid derivative contract, risk is managed through the use of forward sales contracts, other pricing arrangements and, to some extent, futures contracts in highly correlated commodities. These contracts are economic hedges of price risk, but are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. Unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in cost of goods sold in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nWhen a futures position is established, initial margin must be deposited with the applicable exchange or broker. The amount of margin required varies by commodity and is set by the applicable exchange at its sole discretion. If the market price\nrelative to a short futures position increases, an additional margin deposit would be required. Similarly, a margin deposit would be required if the market price relative to a long futures position decreases. Conversely, if the market price increases relative to a long futures position or decreases relative to a short futures position, margin deposits may be returned by the applicable exchange or broker.\nOur policy is to manage our commodity price risk exposure according to internal policies and in alignment with our tolerance for risk. It is our policy that our profitability should come from operations, primarily derived from margins on products sold and grain merchandised, not from hedging transactions. At any one time, inventory and purchase contracts for delivery to us may be substantial. We have risk management policies and procedures that include established net physical position limits. These limits are defined for each commodity and business unit, and business units may include both trader and management limits as appropriate. The limits policy is overseen at a high level by our corporate middle office and compliance team, with day-to-day monitoring procedures being implemented within each individual business unit to ensure any limits overage is explained and exposures reduced, or a temporary limit increase is established if needed. The position limits are reviewed at least annually with our senior leadership and Board of Directors. We monitor current market conditions and may expand or reduce our net position limits or procedures in response to changes in those conditions.\nThe use of hedging instruments does not protect against nonperformance by counterparties to cash contracts. We evaluate counterparty exposure by reviewing contracts and adjusting the values to reflect potential nonperformance. Risk of nonperformance by counterparties includes the inability to perform because of a counterparty's financial condition and the risk that the counterparty will refuse to perform on a contract during periods of price fluctuations where contract prices are significantly different from the current market prices. We manage these risks by entering into fixed-price purchase and sales contracts with preapproved producers and by establishing appropriate limits for individual suppliers. Fixed-price contracts are entered into with customers of acceptable creditworthiness, as internally evaluated. Regarding our use of derivatives, we transact in exchange traded instruments or enter into over-the-counter derivatives that primarily clear through our FCM, which limits our counterparty exposure relative to hedging activities. Historically, we have not experienced significant events of nonperformance on open contracts. Accordingly, we only adjust the estimated fair values of specifically identified contracts for nonperformance. Although we have established policies and procedures, we make no assurances that historical nonperformance experience will carry forward to future periods.\nAs of August 31, 2023 and 2022, we had outstanding commodity futures and options contracts that were used as economic hedges, as well as fixed-price forward contracts related to physical purchases and sales of commodities. The table below presents the notional volumes for all outstanding commodity contracts:\n2023 2022\nDerivative Type Long Short Long Short\n(Units in thousands)\nGrain and oilseed (bushels) 506,654 630,803 609,300 773,239\nEnergy products (barrels) 11,839 8,085 10,541 5,706\nProcessed grain and oilseed (tons) 7,380 9,437 1,191 4,182\nCrop nutrients (tons) 70 10 23 22\nOcean freight (metric tons) 40 - 60 -\nNatural gas (MMBtu) 460 - 420 -\nForeign Exchange Contracts\nWe conduct a substantial portion of our business in U.S. dollars, but we are exposed to risks relating to foreign currency fluctuations primarily due to global grain marketing transactions in South America, the Asia Pacific region and Europe, and purchases of products from Canada. We use foreign currency derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. Although CHS has some risk exposure relating to foreign currency transactions, a larger impact with exchange rate fluctuations is the ability of foreign buyers to purchase U.S. agricultural products and the competitiveness of U.S. agricultural products compared to the same products offered by alternative sources of world supply. The notional amount of our foreign exchange derivative contracts was $1.9 billion as of August 31, 2023 and 2022.\nDerivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedging Strategies\nCertain pay-fixed, receive-variable, cash-settled swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of future crude oil purchases in our Energy segment. We also designate certain pay-variable, receive-fixed, cash-settled swaps as cash flow hedges of future refined product sales. These hedging instruments and the related hedged items are exposed to significant market price risk and potential volatility. As part of our risk management strategy, we look to hedge a portion of our expected future crude oil needs and the resulting refined product output based on prevailing futures prices, management's expectations about future commodity price changes and our risk appetite. We may also elect to dedesignate certain derivative instruments previously designated as cash flow hedges as part of our risk management strategy. Amounts recorded in other comprehensive income for these dedesignated derivative instruments remain in other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings in the period in which the underlying transactions affect earnings. As of August 31, 2023 and 2022, the aggregate notional amount of cash flow hedges was 4.1 million and 3.8 million barrels, respectively.\nThe following table presents the fair value of our commodity derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges and the line items on our Consolidated Balance Sheets in which they are recorded as of August 31, 2023 and 2022:\nDerivative Assets Derivative Liabilities\nBalance Sheet Location 2023 2022 Balance Sheet Location 2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands) (Dollars in thousands)\nOther current assets $ 8,395 $ 27,154 Other current liabilities $ 5,345 $ 11,818\nThe following table presents the pretax losses recorded in other comprehensive income relating to cash flow hedges for the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\n2023 2022 2021\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCommodity derivatives $ (12,285) $ (2,071) $ (7,824)\nThe following table presents the pretax (losses) gains relating to our existing cash flow hedges that were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\nLocation of\n(Loss) Gain 2023 2022 2021\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCommodity derivatives Cost of goods sold $ (14,853) $ (6,254) $ 21,262\nNote 16 Fair Value Measurements\nASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.\nWe determine fair values of derivative instruments and certain other assets, based on the fair value hierarchy established in ASC Topic 820, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances. ASC Topic 820 describes three levels within its hierarchy that may be used to measure fair value, and our assessment of relevant instruments within those levels is as follows:\nLevel 1. Values are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. These assets and liabilities may include exchange-traded derivative instruments, rabbi trust investments, segregated investments and marketable securities.\nLevel 2. Values are based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. These assets and liabilities include interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity swaps; forward commodity contracts with a fixed price component; and other OTC derivatives whose values are determined with inputs that are based on exchange traded prices, adjusted for location-specific\ninputs that are primarily observable in the market or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.\nLevel 3. Values are generated from unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are a significant component of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. These unobservable inputs would reflect our own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing related assets or liabilities. Valuation techniques might include the use of pricing models, discounted cash flow models or similar techniques.\nThe following tables present assets and liabilities, included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, that are recognized at fair value on a recurring basis and indicate the fair value hierarchy utilized to determine these fair values. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is a significant component of the fair value measurement. The lowest level of input is considered Level 3. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the classification of fair value assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy levels.\nRecurring fair value measurements as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, are as follows:\nQuoted Prices in Active Markets\nfor Identical Assets\n(Level 1) Significant Other Observable\nInputs\n(Level 2) Significant\nUnobservable\nInputs\n(Level 3) Total\n(Dollars in thousands)\nAssets\nCommodity derivatives $ 5,344 $ 283,491 $ - $ 288,835\nForeign currency derivatives - 32,402 - 32,402\nSegregated investments and marketable securities 225,715 - - 225,715\nOther assets 89,592 - - 89,592\nTotal $ 320,651 $ 315,893 $ - $ 636,544\nLiabilities\nCommodity derivatives $ 7,501 $ 346,975 $ - $ 354,476\nForeign currency derivatives - 13,799 - 13,799\nTotal $ 7,501 $ 360,774 $ - $ 368,275\nQuoted Prices in Active Markets\nfor Identical Assets\n(Level 1) Significant Other Observable\nInputs\n(Level 2) Significant\nUnobservable\nInputs\n(Level 3) Total\n(Dollars in thousands)\nAssets\nCommodity derivatives $ 1,161 $ 490,160 $ - $ 491,321\nForeign currency derivatives - 52,923 - 52,923\nSegregated investments and marketable securities 238,124 - - 238,124\nOther assets 58,280 - - 58,280\nTotal $ 297,565 $ 543,083 $ - $ 840,648\nLiabilities\nCommodity derivatives $ 10,256 $ 379,883 $ - $ 390,139\nForeign currency derivatives - 12,649 - 12,649\nTotal $ 10,256 $ 392,532 $ - $ 402,788\nCommodity and foreign currency derivatives. Exchange-traded futures and options contracts are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. Our forward commodity purchase and sales contracts with fixed-price components, select ocean freight contracts and other OTC derivatives are determined using inputs that are generally based on exchange traded prices and/or recent market bids and offers, including location-specific adjustments, and are classified within Level 2. Location-specific inputs are driven by local market supply and demand and are generally based on broker or dealer quotations or market transactions in either listed or OTC markets. Changes in the fair values of these contracts are recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations as a component of cost of goods sold.\nSegregated investments and marketable securities and other assets. Our segregated investments and marketable securities and other assets are comprised primarily of investments in various government agencies, U.S. Treasury securities, money market funds and rabbi trust assets, which are valued using quoted market prices and classified within Level 1.\nNote 17 Commitments and Contingencies\nEnvironmental\nWe are required to comply with various environmental laws and regulations incidental to our normal business operations. To meet our compliance requirements, we establish reserves for future costs of remediation associated with identified issues that are both probable and can be reasonably estimated. Estimates of environmental costs are based on current available facts, existing technology, undiscounted site-specific costs and currently enacted laws and regulations and are included in cost of goods sold and marketing, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Recoveries, if any, are recorded in the period in which recovery is received. Liabilities are monitored and adjusted as new facts or changes in law or technology occur. The resolution of any such matters may affect consolidated net income for any fiscal period; however, we currently believe any resulting liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows during any fiscal year.\nOther Litigation and Claims\nWe are involved as a defendant in various lawsuits, claims and disputes, which are in the normal course of our business. The resolution of any such matters may affect consolidated net income for any fiscal period; however, we currently believe any resulting liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows during any fiscal year.\nGuarantees\nWe are a guarantor for lines of credit and performance obligations of related, nonconsolidated companies. Our bank covenants allow maximum guarantees of $1.1 billion, of which $75.9 million were outstanding as of August 31, 2023. We have collateral for a portion of these contingent obligations. We have not recorded a liability related to the contingent obligations as we do not expect to pay out any cash related to them, and the fair values are considered immaterial. The underlying loans to the counterparties for which we provide these guarantees are current as of August 31, 2023.\nCredit Commitments\nCHS Capital has commitments to extend credit to customers if there are no violations of any contractually established conditions. As of August 31, 2023, CHS Capital customers had additional available credit of $1.1 billion.\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nUnconditional purchase obligations are commitments to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum amounts or quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices. Our long-term unconditional purchase obligations primarily relate to pipeline and grain handling take-or-pay and throughput agreements and are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of August 31, 2023, minimum future payments required under long-term commitments that are noncancelable and that third parties have used to secure financing for facilities that will provide contracted goods, are as follows:\nPayments Due by Period\nTotal 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter\n(Dollars in thousands)\nLong-term unconditional purchase obligations $ 451,943 $ 86,073 $ 64,134 $ 61,738 $ 47,795 $ 40,775 $ 151,428\nTotal payments under these arrangements were $77.8 million, $75.2 million and $81.0 million for the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNote 18 Related Party Transactions\nWe purchase and sell grain and other agricultural commodity products from certain equity investees, primarily CF Nitrogen, Ventura Foods, Ardent Mills and TEMCO. Sales to and purchases from related parties for the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, are as follows:\n2023 2022 2021\n(Dollars in thousands)\nSales $ 1,653,125 $ 1,511,532 $ 2,744,482\nPurchases 1,697,780 2,040,357 2,682,165\nReceivables due from and payables due to related parties as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, are as follows:\n2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDue from related parties $ 80,510 $ 78,600\nDue to related parties 90,267 140,174\nAs a cooperative, we are owned by farmers and ranchers and member cooperatives, which are referred to as members. We buy commodities from and provide products and services to our members. Individually, our members do not have a significant ownership in CHS.\nNote 19 Leases\nWe assess arrangements at inception to determine whether they contain a lease. An arrangement is considered to contain a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The right to control the use of an asset must include both (i) the right to obtain substantially all economic benefits associated with an identified asset and (ii) the right to direct how and for what purpose the identified asset is used. Certain service agreements may provide us with the right to use an identified asset; however, most of these arrangements are not considered to represent a lease as we do not control how and for what purpose the identified asset is used.\nWe lease property, plant and equipment used in our operations primarily under operating lease agreements and, to a lesser extent, under finance lease agreements. Our leases are primarily for railcars, equipment, vehicles and office space, many of which contain renewal options and escalation clauses. Renewal options are included as part of the right of use asset and liability when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the renewal option; however, renewal options are generally not included as we are not reasonably certain to exercise such options.\nRight of use assets and liabilities for operating and finance leases are recognized under ASC Topic 842 at the lease commencement date for leases in excess of 12 months based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. For measurement and classification of lease agreements, lease and nonlease components are grouped into a single lease component for all asset classes. Variable lease payments are excluded from measurement of right of use assets and liabilities and generally include payments for nonlease components such as maintenance costs, payments for leased assets beyond their noncancelable lease term and payments for other nonlease components such as sales tax. The discount rate used to calculate present value is our collateralized incremental borrowing rate or, if available, the rate implicit in the lease. The incremental borrowing rate is determined for each lease based primarily on its lease term. Certain lease arrangements include rental payments adjusted annually based on changes in an inflation index. Our lease arrangements generally do not contain residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nLease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
