    "content": "Item 1. Business\nSTRUCTURE\nThe Trust\nThe World Gold Trust (the Trust) was formed as a Delaware statutory trust on August 27, 2014. The Trust consists of multiple series (each, a Fund and collectively, the Funds). Each Fund issues common units of beneficial interest that represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of such Fund. The term of the Trust and each Fund is perpetual (unless terminated earlier in certain circumstances). The Trust was organized in separate series as a Delaware statutory trust rather than as separate statutory trusts to achieve certain administrative and other efficiencies. The Trust is sponsored by WGC USA Asset Management Company, LLC (WGC AM or the Sponsor).\nThe Funds\nThe Trust has established six separate Funds of which one is operational at September 30, 2022. The accompanying financial statements relate to the Trust and SPDR\u00ae Gold MiniShares\u00ae Trust (GLDM).\nGLDM commenced operations on June 26, 2018. GLDMs investment objective is for its shares (the Shares) to reflect the performance of the price of gold bullion, less GLDMs expenses. GLDM issues and redeems Shares from time to time in Creation Units to institutional investors referred to as Authorized Participants. Creation Units are offered continuously at the net asset value (the NAV) for 100,000 Shares on the day that an order to create a Creation Unit is accepted by GLDM. Shares trade under the ticker symbol GLDM on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the NYSE Arca). Authorized Participants and other investors may buy and sell Shares in the secondary market. Authorized share capital is unlimited, and the par value of Shares is $0.00.\nThe principal offices of the Trust and the Funds are at c/o WGC USA Asset Management Company, LLC, 685 Third Avenue, 27th Floor, New York, New York 10017.\nThe Sponsor\nThe Sponsor is a Delaware limited liability company and was formed on August 1, 2014. WGC AM is wholly owned by WGC (US) Holdings, Inc. (WGCUS), a Delaware corporation. Under the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act and the governing documents of the Sponsor, WGCUS is not responsible for the debts, obligations and liabilities of the Sponsor solely by reason of being the sole member of the Sponsor.\nThe Sponsor is responsible for establishing the Funds and for the registration of the shares of each Fund. The Sponsor generally oversees the performance of the Funds principal service providers but does not exercise day-to-day\noversight over such service providers. The Sponsor maintains a public website on behalf of the Funds, containing information about each of the Funds and their respective shares. The Internet address of the Sponsors website is http://www.spdrgoldshares.com. This Internet address is only provided here as a convenience to you, and the information contained on or connected to the Sponsors website is not considered part of this filing.\nThe Trusts annual reports on Form 10-K,\nquarterly reports on Form 10-Q,\ncurrent reports on Form 8-K,\nand any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act are made available free of charge on the Sponsors website after they have been filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). Additional information regarding the Trust may also be found on the SECs EDGAR database at www.sec.gov.\nThe Trustee\nDelaware Trust Company, a Delaware trust company with trust powers, serves as the sole trustee of the Trust (the Trustee). The Trustees duties and liabilities with respect to the offering of shares and the management of the Trust and GLDM are limited to its express obligations under the Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement and Declaration of Trust (Declaration of Trust), dated as of April 16, 2018 and amended on February 6, 2020, between the Sponsor and the Trustee.\nThe Administrator\nThe Administrator of GLDM is BNY Mellon Asset Servicing, a division of The Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM or the Administrator). The Administrator is generally responsible for the day-to-day\nadministration and operation of the Funds, including the calculation of the Funds NAV and NAV per share.\nThe Transfer Agent\nBNYM serves also as GLDMs Transfer Agent in connection with Creation and Redemption transactions of the Shares and acts as the Funds distribution disbursing agent. The Transfer Agent receives and processes orders from Authorized Participants to create and redeem Shares and coordinates the processing of such orders with the Custodian and The Depository Trust Company (DTC).\nThe Custodian\nThe Custodian on behalf of GLDM is ICBC Standard Bank Plc (ICBC or the Custodian). The Custodian is responsible for the safekeeping of the gold bullion held by GLDM, which includes the gold bullion bars delivered to GLDM by Authorized Participants in connection with the creation of Creation Units. The Custodian also facilitates the transfer of gold bullion into and out of GLDM through gold bullion accounts maintained for Authorized Participants. The Custodian is a market maker, clearer and approved weigher under the rules of the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA). The Custodian maintains insurance in support of its custodial obligations under the Allocated Bullion Account Agreement to help protect against the risk of loss for gold deposits. There can be no guarantee such insurance will be sufficient to cover all potential loss of gold deposits.\nThe Marketing Agent\nThe Marketing Agent is State Street Global Advisors Funds Distributors, LLC (the Marketing Agent). The Sponsor has entered into the Marketing Agent Agreement with the Marketing Agent to assist the Sponsor in marketing the Funds shares. The Marketing Agent is a registered broker-dealer with the SEC and is a member of FINRA.\nINVESTMENT OBJECTIVE\nThe investment objective of GLDM is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of gold bullion, less GLDMs expenses. The Shares trade on the NYSE Arca and provide institutional and retail investors with indirect access to the gold bullion market. The Shares may be bought and sold on the NYSE Arca like any other exchange-listed securities. The Sponsor expects that, for many investors, costs associated with buying and selling the Shares in the secondary market and the payment of GLDMs ongoing expenses will be lower than the costs associated with buying and selling gold bullion and storing and insuring gold bullion in a traditional allocated gold bullion account. The Shares are also listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange (Bolsa Mexicana de Valores).\nGLDMs NAV is the aggregate value of GLDMs assets less its liabilities (which include estimated accrued but unpaid fees and expenses). The NAV is calculated based on the price of gold per ounce times the number of ounces of gold owned by GLDM. For purposes of calculating NAV, the number of\nounces of gold owned by GLDM reflects the amount of gold delivered into (or out of) GLDM on a daily basis by Authorized Participants creating and redeeming Shares. Except as otherwise described herein, in determining the NAV, the Administrator will value the gold bullion held by GLDM on the basis of the price of an ounce of gold determined by the IBA 3:00 PM auction process (LBMA Gold Price PM). If no LBMA Gold Price PM is made on a particular evaluation day or if the LBMA Gold Price PM has not been announced by 12:00 p.m. New York time on a particular evaluation day, the next most recent LBMA Gold Price (AM or PM) will be used to determine the NAV, unless the Sponsor determines that such price is inappropriate to use as the basis for such determination. If the Sponsor determines that such price is inappropriate to use, it shall identify an alternate basis for evaluation of the gold bullion held by GLDM.\nOVERVIEW\nGLDM is a passive investment vehicle designed for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of gold bullion, less GLDMs expenses. GLDMs gold bullion holdings are not managed and GLDM does not have any investment discretion.\nGLDM is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is not required to register under such act. GLDM will not hold or trade in commodity futures contracts regulated by the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (the CEA) as administered by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC). GLDM is not a commodity pool for purposes of the CEA, and none of the Sponsor, the Trustee or the Marketing Agent is subject to regulation as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading advisor in connection with the Shares.\nGLDM holds only gold bullion. As such, the gold bullion held by GLDM will only be sold (1) on an as-needed\nbasis to pay GLDMs expenses, (2) in the event GLDM terminates and liquidates its assets, or (3) as otherwise required by law or regulation. The sale of gold bullion by GLDM is a taxable event to shareholders.\nSales of Gold\nThe Administrator sells GLDMs gold as necessary to pay its expenses. As a result, the amount of gold sold will vary from time to time depending on the level of expenses and the market price of gold. Unless otherwise directed by the Sponsor, the Administrator sells gold to the Custodian at the next LBMA Gold Price PM, following the sale order. Neither the Administrator nor the Sponsor is liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of any sale. Any cash held by the Administrator on behalf of the Funds does not bear any interest.\nThe Administrator may also sell GLDMs gold if the Sponsor notifies the Administrator that the sale of gold is required by applicable law or regulation or in connection with the termination and liquidation of GLDM. The Administrator will not be liable or responsible in any way for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of any sale of gold directed by the Sponsor. Any property received by GLDM other than gold, cash or an amount receivable in cash (such as, for example, an insurance claim) will be promptly sold or otherwise disposed of by the Administrator.\nGold Price Information\nInvestors may obtain gold pricing information on a 24-hour\nbasis based on the spot price for an ounce of gold from various financial information service providers. Current spot prices are also generally available with bid/ask spreads from gold bullion dealers. In addition, the Sponsors website provides ongoing pricing information for gold spot prices and the Shares. Market prices for the Shares are available from a variety of sources including brokerage firms, information websites and other information service providers. The NAV of GLDM is published by the Sponsor on each day that the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading and is posted on the Sponsors website at www.spdrgoldshares.com.\nTHE GOLD INDUSTRY\nGold Supply and Demand\nGold is a physical asset that is accumulated rather than consumed. As a result, virtually all the gold that has ever been mined still exists today in one form or another. The following table is a summary of the world gold supply and demand for the past 5 years. It is based on information reported in Gold Focus 2022\n.\nWorld Gold Supply and Demand (2017-2021)\nTonnes\nSUPPLY\nMine Production\n3,573\n3,655\n3,595\n3,476\n3,581\nRecycling\n1,112\n1,132\n1,276\n1,293\n1,136\nNet Hedging Supply\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotal Supply\n4,685\n4,787\n4,877\n4,769\n4,717\nDEMAND\nJewelry Fabrication\n2,257\n2,290\n2,152\n1,324\n2,229\nIndustrial Demand\nNet Physical Investment\n1,035\n1,067\n1,168\nNet Hedging Demand\n-\nNet Official Sector Buying\nTotal Demand\n4,024\n4,360\n3,927\n2,811\n4,204\nMarket Balance\n1,958\nNet Investment in ETPs\nMarket Balance less ETPs\n1,069\nGold Price (US$/oz, London)\n1,257\n1,268\n1,393\n1,770\n1,799\nSource: Gold Focus 2022\nSources of Gold Supply\nBased on data from Gold Focus 2022\n, gold supply averaged 4,767 tonnes per year between 2017 and 2021. Sources of gold supply include both mine production and recycled above-ground stocks and, to a lesser extent, producer net hedging. The largest portion of gold supplied to the market is from mine production, which averaged approximately 3,576 tonnes per year from 2017 through 2021. The second largest source of annual gold supply is recycling gold, which is gold that has been recovered from jewelry and other fabricated products and converted back into marketable gold. Recycled gold averaged approximately 1,190 tonnes annually between 2017 through 2021.\nSources of Gold Demand\nBased on data from Gold Focus 2022\n, gold demand averaged 3,865 tonnes per year between 2017 and 2021. Gold demand generally comes from four sources: jewelry, industry (including medical applications), investment and the official sector (including central banks and supranational organizations). The largest source of demand comes from jewelry fabrication, which accounted for approximately 53% of the identifiable demand from 2017 through 2021 followed by net physical investment, which represents identifiable investment demand, which accounted for approximately 26%.\nGold Focus 2022\nis published by Metals Focus, Ltd. which is a precious metals research consultancy based in London. Metals Focus Data Ltd., an affiliate of the Sponsor, provides the supply and demand data to Metals Focus, Ltd. When used in this prospectus tonne refers to one metric tonne, which is equivalent to 1,000 kilograms or 32,151 troy ounces.\nGold demand is widely dispersed throughout the world with significant contributions from India and China. In many countries there are seasonal fluctuations in the levels of demand for gold-especially jewelry. However, as a result of variations in the timing of seasons throughout the world, seasonal fluctuations in demand do not appear to have a significant impact on the global gold price.\nBetween 2017 and 2021, according to Gold Focus 2022\n, central bank purchases averaged 470 tonnes. The prominence given by market commentators to this activity coupled with the total amount of gold held by the official sector has resulted in this area being one of the more visible shifts in the gold market.\nOperation of the Gold Bullion Market\nThe global trade in gold consists of over-the-counter\n(OTC) transactions in spot, forwards, and options and other derivatives, together with exchange-traded futures and options.\nGlobal Over-the-Counter\nMarket\nThe OTC market trades on a continuous basis and accounts for most global gold trading. Market makers and participants in the OTC market trade with each other and their clients on a principal-to-principal\nbasis. All risks and issues of credit are between the parties directly involved in the transaction. The three products relevant to LBMA market making are Spot (S), Forwards (F) and Options (O). There are twelve LBMA Market Makers who provide the service in one, two or all three products.\nMember\nMembership Type\nSpot (S)\nForwards (F)\nOptions (O)\nCitibank N A\nFull Market Makers\nx\nx\nx\nCredit Suisse AG Zurich\nFull Market Makers\nx\nx\nx\nGoldman Sachs International\nFull Market Makers\nx\nx\nx\nHSBC\nFull Market Makers\nx\nx\nx\nJP Morgan Chase Bank\nFull Market Makers\nx\nx\nx\nMorgan Stanley & Co International Ltd\nFull Market Makers\nx\nx\nx\nUBS AG\nFull Market Makers\nx\nx\nx\nBNP Paribas SA\nMarket Makers\nx\nICBC Standard Bank Plc\nMarket Makers\nx\nMerrill Lynch International\nMarket Makers\nx\nx\nStandard Chartered Bank\nMarket Makers\nx\nx\nToronto-Dominion Bank\nMarket Makers\nx\nThe OTC market provides a relatively flexible market in term of quotes, price, size, destinations for delivery and other factors. Bullion dealers customize transactions to meet their clients requirements. The OTC market has no formal structure and no open-outcry meeting place.\nThe main centers of the OTC market are London, New York and Zurich. Mining companies, central banks, manufacturers of jewelry and industrial products, together with investors and speculators, tend to transact their business through one of these centers. Centers such as Dubai and several cities in the Far East also transact substantial OTC market business. Bullion dealers have offices around the world and most of the worlds major bullion dealers are either members or associate members of the LBMA.\nIn the OTC market, the standard size of gold trades ranges between 5,000 and 10,000 ounces. Bid-offer\nspreads are typically $0.50 per ounce. Transaction costs in the OTC market are negotiable between the parties and therefore vary widely, with some dealers willing to offer clients competitive prices for larger volumes, although this will vary according to the dealer, the client and market conditions. Cost indicators can be obtained from various information service providers as well as dealers.\nLiquidity in the OTC market can vary from time to time during the course of the 24-hour\ntrading day. Fluctuations in liquidity are reflected in adjustments to dealing spreads-the difference between a dealers buy and sell prices. The period of greatest liquidity in the gold market generally occurs at the time of day when trading in the European time zones overlaps with trading in the United States, which is when OTC market trading in London, New York and other centers coincides with futures and options trading on the Commodity Exchange Inc. (the COMEX).\nThe London Bullion Market\nAlthough the market for physical gold is global, most OTC market trades are cleared through London. In addition to coordinating market activities, the LBMA acts as the principal point of contact between the market and its regulators. A primary function of the LBMA is its involvement in the promotion of refining standards by maintenance of the London Good Delivery Lists, which are the lists of LBMA accredited melters and assayers of gold. The LBMA also coordinates market clearing and vaulting, promotes good trading practices and develops standard documentation.\nThe term loco London refers to gold bars physically held in London that meet the specifications for weight, dimensions, fineness (or purity), identifying marks (including the assay stamp of an LBMA acceptable refiner) and appearance set forth in The Good Delivery Rules for Gold and Silver Bars published by the LBMA. Gold bars meeting these requirements are known as London Good Delivery Bars. The unit of trade in London is the troy ounce, whose conversion between grams is: 1,000 grams = 32.1507465 troy ounces and 1 troy ounce = 31.1034768 grams. A London Good Delivery Bar is acceptable for delivery in settlement of a transaction on the OTC market. Typically referred to as 400-\nounce bars, a London Good Delivery Bar must contain between 350 and 430 fine troy ounces of gold, with a minimum fineness (or purity) of 995 parts per 1,000 (99.5%), be of good appearance and be easy to handle and stack. The fine gold content of a gold bar is calculated by multiplying the gross weight of the bar (expressed in units of 0.025 troy ounces) by the fineness of the bar.\nLBMA Gold Price\nThe LBMA Gold Price is determined twice daily during London trading hours through an auction which provides reference gold prices for that days trading. The LBMA Gold Price was initiated on March 20, 2015 and replaced the London PM Gold Fix. The auction that determines the LBMA Gold Price is a physically settled, electronic and tradeable auction, with the ability to settle trades in U.S. dollars, euros or British pounds. The IBA provides the auction platform and methodology as well as the overall administration and governance for the LBMA Gold Price. Many long-term contracts are expected to be priced on the basis of either the morning (AM) or afternoon (PM) LBMA Gold Price, and many market participants are expected to refer to one or the other of these prices when looking for a basis for valuations.\nParticipants in the IBA auction process submit anonymous bids and offers which are published on screen and in real-time. Throughout the auction process, aggregated gold bids and offers are updated in real-time with the imbalance calculated and the price updated every 45 seconds until the buy and sell orders are matched. When the net volume of all participants falls within a pre-determined\ntolerance, the auction is deemed complete and the applicable LBMA Gold Price is published. Information about the auction process (such as aggregated bid and offer volumes) will be immediately available after the auction on the IBAs website.\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (the FCA) in the U.K. regulates the LBMA Gold Price.\nFutures Exchanges\nAlthough GLDM does not invest in gold futures, information about the gold futures market is relevant as such markets are a source of liquidity for the overall market for gold and impact the price of gold.\nThe most significant gold futures exchange is the COMEX, part of the CME Group. It began to offer trading in gold futures contracts in 1974, and for most of the period since that date, it has been the largest exchange in the world for trading precious metals futures and options. The Tokyo Commodity Exchange (the TOCOM) is another significant futures exchange and has been trading gold since 1982. Trading on these exchanges is based on fixed delivery dates and transaction sizes for the futures and options contracts traded. Trading costs are negotiable. As a matter of practice, only a small percentage of the futures market turnover ever comes to physical delivery of the gold represented by the contracts traded. Both exchanges permit trading on margin. Margin trading can add to the speculative risk involved given the potential for margin calls if the price moves against the contract holder. Both the COMEX and the TOCOM operate through a central clearance system, and in each case, the exchange acts as a counterparty for each member for clearing purposes. Other commodity exchanges include, the Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX), the Shanghai Futures Exchange, the Shanghai Gold Exchange, ICE Futures US (the ICE), and the Dubai Gold & Commodities Exchange. The ICE and CME Group are members of the Intermarket Surveillance Group (ISG).\nMarket Regulation\nThe global gold markets are overseen and regulated by both governmental and self-regulatory organizations. In addition, certain trade associations have established rules and protocols for market practices and participants.\nMovements in the Price of Gold\nThe following chart provides historical background on the price of gold. The chart illustrates movements in the price of gold in U.S. dollars per ounce over the period from the day the Shares began trading on the NYSE on June 26, 2018 to September 30, 2022, and is based on the LBMA Gold Price PM.\nDaily Gold Price - June 26, 2018 - September 30, 2022\nLBMA Gold Price PM USD\nCREATION AND REDEMPTION OF SHARES\nGLDM creates and redeems Shares from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Units (a Creation Unit equals a block of 100,000 Shares). The creation and redemption of Creation Units is only made in exchange for the delivery to GLDM or the distribution by GLDM of the amount of gold bullion represented by the Creation Units being created or redeemed. The amount of gold bullion required to be delivered to GLDM in connection with any creation, or paid out upon redemption, is based on the combined NAV of the number of Shares included in the Creation Units being created or redeemed as\ndetermined on the day the order to create or redeem Creation Units is properly received and accepted. The standard settlement cycle for most broker-dealer securities transactions is two business days, T+2 (the trade date plus two business days).\nAuthorized Participants are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem Creation Units. To become an Authorized Participant, a person must enter into a Participant Agreement with the Administrator. The Participant Agreement and the related procedures attached thereto may be amended by the Administrator and the Sponsor without the consent of any shareholder or Authorized Participant. Authorized Participants who make deposits with GLDM in exchange for Creation Units receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either the Sponsor or GLDM, and no such person has any obligation or responsibility to the Sponsor or GLDM to effect any sale or resale of Shares.\nAuthorized Participants may act for their own accounts or as agents for broker-dealers, custodians and other securities market participants that wish to create or redeem Creation Units. An order for one or more Creation Units may be placed by an Authorized Participant on behalf of multiple clients. Persons interested in purchasing Creation Units should contact the Sponsor or the Administrator to obtain the contact information for the Authorized Participants. Shareholders who are not Authorized Participants will only be able to redeem their Shares through an Authorized Participant.\nAs of the date of this annual report, the Authorized Participants are Goldman Sachs & Co., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, UBS Securities LLC, Virtu Americas LLC and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. An updated list of Authorized Participants can be obtained from the Administrator or the Sponsor.\nAll gold bullion must be delivered by Authorized Participants to GLDM and distributed by GLDM in unallocated form through credits and debits between Authorized Participants Unallocated Accounts and the GLDM Unallocated Account.\nAll gold bullion must be of at least a minimum fineness (or purity) of 995 parts per 1,000 (99.5%) and otherwise conform to the rules, regulations, practices and customs of the LBMA, including the specifications for a London Good Delivery Bar.\nDelivery of Required Deposits\nAn Authorized Participant who places a purchase order is responsible for transferring the required gold bullion deposit amount to the GLDM Unallocated Account on the second business day in London following the purchase order date. Upon receipt of the gold bullion deposit amount, the Administrator will direct DTC to credit the number of Creation Units ordered to the Authorized Participants DTC account. The expense and risk of delivery, ownership and safekeeping of gold bullion until such gold bullion has been received by GLDM will be borne solely by the Authorized Participant. If gold bullion is to be delivered other than as described above, the Sponsor is authorized to establish such procedures and to appoint such custodians and establish such custody accounts as the Sponsor determines to be desirable.\nActing on standing instructions given by the Administrator, the Custodian will transfer the gold bullion deposit amount from the GLDM Unallocated Account to the GLDM Allocated Account by allocating to the GLDM Allocated Account specific bars of gold bullion which the Custodian holds or instructing a subcustodian to allocate specific bars of gold bullion held by or for the subcustodian. The gold bullion bars in an allocated gold bullion account are specific to that account and are identified by a list which shows, for each gold bullion bar, the refiner, assay or fineness, serial number and gross and fine weight. Gold bullion held in GLDMs allocated account is the property of GLDM and is not traded, leased or loaned under any circumstances.\nThe Custodian will use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the transfer of gold bullion to the GLDM Allocated Account prior to the time by which the Administrator is to credit the Creation Unit to\nthe Authorized Participants DTC account; if, however, such transfers have not been completed by such time, the number of Creation Units ordered will be delivered against receipt of the gold bullion deposit amount in the GLDM Unallocated Account, and all shareholders will be exposed to the risks of unallocated gold bullion to the extent of that gold bullion deposit amount until the Custodian completes the allocation process. See Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Custody of Gold-Gold bullion held in GLDMs unallocated gold bullion account and any Authorized Participants unallocated gold bullion account is not segregated from the Custodians assets.\nRejection of Purchase Orders\nGLDM has the right, but not the obligation, to reject a purchase order if (i) the order is not in proper form as described in the Participant Agreement, (ii) the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of its counsel, might be unlawful, (iii) it determines that acceptance of the order from an Authorized Participant would expose GLDM to credit risk, or (iv) circumstances outside the control of the Administrator, the Sponsor or the Custodian make the purchase, for all practical purposes, not feasible to process.\nRedemption Procedures\nThe procedures by which an Authorized Participant can redeem one or more Creation Units mirror the procedures for the creation of Creation Units. On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Administrator to redeem one or more Creation Units. Redemption orders must be placed with the Administrator no later than 3:59:59 p.m. New York time. A redemption order so received is effective on the date it is received in satisfactory form by the Administrator. The day on which the Administrator receives a valid redemption order is the redemption order date.\nTrading of Shares\nThe Shares are listed on NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol GLDM. The Shares may be bought and sold in the secondary market throughout the trading day like other publicly traded securities. While the Shares are issued in Creation Units at NAV, the Shares traded in the secondary market may trade at prices that are lower or higher than their NAV per Share. The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the NAV per Share is a function of supply and demand, among other things, and may be influenced by non-concurrent\ntrading hours between NYSE Arca and the COMEX, London, Zurich and Singapore. While the Shares trade on NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. New York time, liquidity in the global gold market is reduced after the close of the COMEX at 1:30 p.m. New York time. As a result, after 1:30 p.m. New York time, trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount, on the Shares may widen.\nMost retail investors purchase and sell the Shares through traditional brokerage or other intermediary accounts. Purchases or sales of the Shares in the secondary market, which will not involve the Funds, may be subject to customary brokerage commissions.\nDetermination of Redemption Distribution\nThe redemption distribution from GLDM consists of a credit to the redeeming Authorized Participants Unallocated Account in the amount of the Creation Unit Gold Delivery Amount. The Creation Unit Gold Delivery Amount for redemptions is the number of ounces of gold bullion held by GLDM to be paid out upon redemption of a Creation Unit. There will be no cash distributions made to Authorized Participants upon redemption.\nDelivery of Redemption Distribution\nThe redemption distribution due from GLDM is delivered to the Authorized Participant on the second business day following the redemption order date if, by 10:00 a.m. New York time on such second business day, the Administrators DTC account has been credited with the Creation Units to be\nredeemed. The Custodian transfers the redemption gold bullion amount from the GLDM Allocated Account to the GLDM Unallocated Account and, thereafter, to the redeeming Authorized Participants unallocated account. The Authorized Participant and GLDM are each at risk in respect of gold bullion credited to their respective unallocated accounts in the event of the Custodians insolvency. See Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Custody of Gold-Gold bullion held in GLDMs unallocated gold bullion account and any Authorized Participants unallocated gold bullion account is not segregated from the Custodians assets.\nSuspension or Rejection of Redemption Orders\nGLDM may, in its discretion, and will when directed by the Sponsor, suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the redemption settlement date for: (1) any period during which NYSE Arca is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings, or trading on NYSE Arca is suspended or restricted, (2) any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which delivery, disposal or evaluation of gold bullion is not reasonably practicable, or (3) such other period as the Sponsor determines to be necessary for the protection of the shareholders.\nGLDM has the right, but not the obligation, to reject a redemption order if (i) the order is not in proper form as described in the Participant Agreement, (ii) the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of its counsel, might be unlawful, (iii) it determines that acceptance of the order from an Authorized Participant would expose GLDM to credit risk, or (iv) circumstances outside the control of the Administrator, the Sponsor or the Custodian make the redemption, for all practical purposes, not feasible to process.\nThe Sponsor will not be liable to any person or liable in any way for any loss or damages that may result from any such suspension, postponement or rejection.\nCreation and Redemption Transaction Fee\nAn Authorized Participant is required to pay a transaction fee to the Administrator of $500 per order to create or redeem Creation Units of GLDM. An order may include multiple Creation Units. The transaction fee may be changed from time to time at the sole discretion of the Sponsor and upon written notice to the Authorized Participant, which notice may be provided by disclosure in GLDMs prospectus. In addition, the Sponsor may waive the transaction fee on the creation or redemption of Creation Units for one or more Authorized Participants from time to time in its sole discretion.\nLIABILITY\nNo shareholder of GLDM shall be subject in such capacity to any personal liability whatsoever to any person in connection with GLDMs property or the acts, obligations or affairs of GLDM. Shareholders shall have the same limitation of personal liability as is extended to stockholders of a private corporation for profit incorporated under the Delaware General Corporation Law.\nCUSTODY OF GLDMS GOLD\nThe Custodian and its affiliates may from time to time purchase or sell gold bullion or Shares for their own accounts, as agents for their customers and for accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. Unless otherwise agreed by GLDM, the Custodian will hold the gold bullion deposited with and held for the account of GLDM at its London, England vault, except when the gold bullion has been allocated in the vault of a subcustodian solely for temporary custody and safekeeping. If held by a subcustodian, the Custodian has agreed that it will use commercially reasonable efforts promptly to transport the gold bullion from the subcustodians vault to the Custodians vault, at the Custodians cost and risk. The Custodian is a market maker, clearer and approved weigher of gold under the rules of the LBMA.\nThe Custodian, as instructed by the Sponsor or GLDM, is authorized to accept, on behalf of GLDM, deposits of gold bullion in unallocated form. Acting on standing instructions given by the Sponsor or GLDM, the Custodian allocates gold bullion deposited in unallocated form with GLDM by selecting bars of gold bullion for deposit to the GLDM Allocated Account from unallocated bars that the Custodian holds or by instructing a subcustodian to allocate bars from unallocated bars held by the subcustodian. All gold bullion allocated to GLDM must conform to the rules, regulations, practices and customs of the LBMA, and the Custodian must replace any nonconforming gold bullion with conforming gold bullion as soon as practical.\nThe gold bullion bars in an allocated gold bullion account are specific to that account and are identified by a list which shows, for each gold bullion bar, the refiner, assay or fineness, serial number and gross and fine weight. Gold bullion held in GLDMs allocated account is the property of GLDM and is not traded, leased or loaned under any circumstances.\nThe gold bullion bars held in an unallocated account are not segregated from the Custodians assets. The account holder therefore has no ownership interest in any specific bars of gold bullion that the unallocated accounts bullion dealer holds or owns. The account holder is an unsecured creditor of the bullion dealer, and credits to an unallocated account are at risk of the bullion dealers insolvency, in which event it may not be possible for a liquidator to identify any gold bullion held in an unallocated account as belonging to the account holder rather than to the bullion dealer.\nThe Trust, on behalf of GLDM, and the Custodian have entered into Custody Agreements that establish the GLDM Unallocated Account and the GLDM Allocated Account. The GLDM Unallocated Account is used for several purposes including to facilitate the transfer of gold bullion deposits and gold bullion redemption distributions between Authorized Participants and GLDM in connection with the creation and redemption of Creation Units. It is also used for sales of gold bullion to pay GLDMs expenses, and when gold bullion is transferred into and out of GLDM. The Custodian is instructed to allocate all gold bullion deposited with GLDM to the GLDM Allocated Account by the close of business on each Business Day.\nThe Custodian is authorized to appoint from time to time one or more subcustodians to hold GLDMs gold bullion until it can be transported to the Custodians vault. The Custodian has not utilized any subcustodians to date. In accordance with LBMA practices and customs, the Custodian does not have written custody agreements with the subcustodians it selects. This could affect the recourse of GLDM and the Custodian against any subcustodian in the event a subcustodian does not use due care in the safekeeping of GLDMs gold bullion. See Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Custody of Gold-The ability of the Administrator and the Custodian to take legal action against subcustodians may be limited. The Custodian is required to use reasonable care in selecting subcustodians and will monitor the conduct of each subcustodian, and, where it is legally permissible to do so, promptly advise the Trust of any difficulties or problems existing with respect to such subcustodian of which the Custodian is aware. The Custodian is obliged under the Allocated Gold Account Agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain delivery of gold bullion from those subcustodians appointed by it. Under the Allocated Gold Account Agreement, except for an obligation on the part of the Custodian to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain delivery of GLDMs gold bullion bars from any subcustodians appointed by the Custodian, the Custodian is not liable for the acts or omissions, or for the solvency, of its subcustodians unless the selection of such subcustodians was made by the Custodian fraudulently, negligently or in bad faith. Under the customs and practices of the London bullion market, allocated gold bullion is held by custodians and, on their behalf, by subcustodians under arrangements that permit each entity for which gold bullion is being held: (1) to request from the entitys custodian (and a custodian or subcustodian to request from its subcustodian) a list identifying each gold bullion bar being held and the identity of the particular custodian or subcustodian holding the gold bullion bar and (2) to request the entitys custodian to release the entitys gold within two business days following demand for release. Each custodian or subcustodian is obligated under the customs and practices of the London bullion market to provide the bar list and the identification of custodians and subcustodians referred to in\n(1) above, and each custodian is obligated to release gold as requested. Under English law, unless otherwise provided in any applicable custody agreement, a custodian generally is liable to its customer for failing to take reasonable care of the customers gold and for failing to release the customers gold upon demand.\nThe Custodian does not require any subcustodians to be insured or bonded with respect to their custodial activities. The Custodian has agreed to maintain insurance in connection with the storage of GLDMs precious metal under the Custody Agreements, including covering any loss of gold, on such terms and conditions as it considers appropriate, which may not cover the full amount of gold. The Sponsor (so long as the Sponsor is WGC AM) and GLDM may, subject to confidentiality restrictions, review this insurance coverage, and the Custodian will provide the Trust with evidence of the Custodians insurance at GLDMs request within 10 business days following the end of the calendar year. GLDM will not be a beneficiary of any such insurance and does not have the ability to dictate the nature or amount of the coverage. Therefore, shareholders cannot be assured that the Custodian maintains adequate insurance or any insurance with respect to the gold bullion held by the Custodian on behalf of GLDM.\nDescription of the GLDM Custody Agreements\nThe Allocated Gold Account Agreement and the Unallocated Gold Account Agreement between the Trust, on behalf of GLDM, and the Custodian establishes the GLDM Allocated Account and the GLDM Unallocated Account, respectively. These agreements are sometimes referred to together as the Custody Agreements. The following is a description of the material terms of the Custody Agreements. As the Custody Agreements are similar in form, they are discussed together, with material distinctions between the agreements noted.\nTransfers into the GLDM Unallocated Account\nThe Custodian credits to the GLDM Unallocated Account the amount of gold bullion it receives from the GLDM Allocated Account, an Authorized Participants unallocated gold account, or from other third-party unallocated accounts representing the right to receive gold bullion. Unless otherwise agreed by the Custodian in writing, the only gold bullion the Custodian will accept in physical form for credit to the GLDM Unallocated Account is gold bullion transferred from the GLDM Allocated Account. No interest will be paid by the Custodian on any credit balance to the GLDM Unallocated Account.\nTransfers from the GLDM Unallocated Account\nThe Custodian transfers gold bullion from the GLDM Unallocated Account only in accordance with the instructions to the Custodian. A transfer of gold bullion from the GLDM Unallocated Account may only be made (1) by transferring gold bullion to an Authorized Participants unallocated account, (2) by transferring gold bullion to the GLDM Allocated Account, (3) by making gold bullion available for collection at the Custodians vault premises or at such other location as the Custodian may specify, (4) by delivering the gold bullion to such location as the Trust directs at GLDMs expense and risk, or (5) by transferring to an account maintained by the Custodian or by a third party on an unallocated basis in connection with the sale of Gold or other permitted transfers. Any gold bullion made available in physical form will be in a form which complies with the rules, regulations, practices and customs of the LBMA, the Bank of England or any applicable regulatory body, or Custody Rules, or in such other form as may be agreed between the Administrator and the Custodian, and in all cases will comprise one or more whole gold bullion bars selected by the Custodian.\nThe Custody Agreements provide for the full allocation of all gold bullion received from the Authorized Participants or other third parties and credited to the GLDM Unallocated Account at the end of each business day. The Sponsor established an overdraft facility with the Custodian under which the Custodian makes available to the GLDM Unallocated Account up to 430 fine ounces of gold bullion in\norder to allow the Custodian to fully allocate all gold bullion credited to the GLDM Unallocated Account to the GLDM Allocated Account at the end of each business day.\nTransfers into the GLDM Allocated Account\nWith respect to gold bullion delivered by Authorized Participants, the Custodian receives transfers of gold bullion into the GLDM Allocated Account only at the Trusts instructions by debiting gold bullion from the GLDM Unallocated Account and crediting such gold bullion to the GLDM Allocated Account.\nTransfers from the GLDM Allocated Account\nThe Custodian transfers gold bullion from the GLDM Allocated Account only in accordance with the Trusts instructions. Generally, the Custodian transfers gold bullion from the GLDM Allocated Account only by debiting gold bullion from the GLDM Allocated Account and crediting the gold bullion to the GLDM Unallocated Account.\nWithdrawals of Gold Directly from the GLDM Allocated Account\nUpon the Trusts instruction, the Custodian debits gold bullion from the GLDM Allocated Account and makes the gold bullion available for collection by the Trust or, if separately agreed, for delivery by the Custodian in accordance with its usual practices at GLDMs expense and risk. The Trust and the Custodian expect that the Trust will withdraw gold bullion physically from the GLDM Allocated Account (rather than by crediting it to the GLDM Unallocated Account and instructing a further transfer from that account) only in exceptional circumstances, such as if, for some unforeseen reason, it was not possible to transfer gold bullion in unallocated form. The Custodian is not obliged to effect any requested delivery if, in its reasonable opinion, (1) this would cause the Custodian or its agents to be in breach of the Custody Rules or other applicable law, court order or regulation, (2) the costs incurred would be excessive or (3) delivery is impracticable for any reason. When gold bullion is physically withdrawn from the GLDM Allocated Account pursuant to the Trusts instruction, all right, title, risk and interest in and to the gold bullion withdrawn shall pass to the person to whom or for whose account such gold bullion is transferred, delivered or collected at the time the recipient or its agent acknowledges in writing its receipt of gold bullion. Unless the Trust specifies the bars of gold bullion to be debited from the GLDM Allocated Account, the Custodian is entitled to select the gold bullion bars.\nExclusion of Liability\nThe Custodian will use reasonable care in the performance of its duties under the Custody Agreements and is only responsible for any loss or damage suffered by GLDM as a direct result of any negligence, fraud, or willful default on the part of the Custodian in the performance of the duties under the Custody Agreements. The Custodians liability is further limited to the market value of the gold bullion held in the GLDM Allocated Account and the amount of the gold bullion credited to the GLDM Unallocated Account at the time such negligence, fraud, or willful default is either discovered by or notified to the Custodian, provided that the Custodian notifies the Sponsor and the Trust promptly after any discovery. Furthermore, the Custodian has no duty to make or take or to require any subcustodian selected by it to make or take any special arrangements or precautions beyond those required by the Custody Rules or as specifically set forth in the Custody Agreements.\nIn the event of a loss caused by the failure of the Custodian or a subcustodian to exercise reasonable care, the Trust, on behalf of GLDM, has the right to seek recovery from the Custodian in breach. The Custodian is not liable for any delay in performance or any non-performance\nof any of its obligations under the Custody Agreements by reason of any cause beyond the Custodians reasonable control, including any act of God or war or terrorism, any breakdown, malfunction or failure of, or in connection with, any communication, computer, transmission, clearing or settlement facilities, industrial action, acts, rules and regulations of any governmental or supra national bodies or authorities or relevant regulatory or self-regulatory organizations.\nIndemnity\nSolely out of GLDMs assets, GLDM will indemnify the Custodian against all costs and expenses, damages, liabilities and losses (other than Value Added Tax and the expenses assumed by the Sponsor under its Agreement with the Custodian) which the Custodian may suffer or incur, directly or indirectly, in connection with services provided to GLDM under the Custody Agreements, except to the extent that such sums are due directly to the Custodians negligence, willful default or fraud.\nTermination\nGLDM and the Custodian may each terminate any Custody Agreement upon 90 business days prior written notice. GLDM and the Custodian each may terminate any Custody Agreement immediately by written notice in the event it becomes unlawful for the Custodian or the Trust to be a party to the Agreement or for the Custodian to offer its services to the Trust or for the Trust to receive such services. GLDM and the Custodian each may terminate any Custody Agreement immediately by written notice in the event either party determines in its commercially reasonable opinion the existence of the presentation of a winding-up\norder, bankruptcy or analogous event in relation to the other party. If either the Allocated Gold Account Agreement or the Unallocated Gold Account Agreement is terminated, the other agreement automatically terminates.\nGoverning Law\nThe GLDM Custody Agreements are governed by English law. The Administrator and the Custodian both consent to the non-exclusive\njurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and the federal courts located in the borough of Manhattan in New York City. Such consent is not required for any person to assert a claim of New York jurisdiction over the Trustee or the Custodian.\nUNITED STATES FEDERAL TAX CONSEQUENCES\nThe following discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences that generally apply to the purchase, ownership and disposition of Shares by a U.S. Shareholder (as defined below), and certain U.S. federal gift and estate tax consequences that generally apply to an investment in Shares by a Non-U.S.\nShareholder (as defined below), represents, insofar as it describes conclusions as to U.S. federal tax law and subject to the limitations and qualifications described therein, the opinion of Carter Ledyard & Milburn LLP, special U.S. federal tax counsel to the Sponsor. The discussion below is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the Code), Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code and judicial and administrative interpretations of the Code, all as in effect on the date of this annual report and all of which are subject to changes either prospectively or retroactively. The tax treatment of Shareholders may vary depending upon their own particular circumstances. Certain Shareholders (including broker-dealers, traders or other investors with special circumstances) may be subject to special rules not discussed herein. In addition, the following discussion applies only to investors who hold Shares as capital assets within the meaning of Code section 1221. Moreover, the discussion herein does not address the effect of any state, local or foreign tax law on the disposition of Shares. Purchasers of Shares are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to all U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax law considerations potentially applicable to their investment in Shares.\nFor purposes of this discussion, a U.S. Shareholder is a Shareholder that is:\nAn individual who is a U.S. citizen or resident of the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes;\nAn entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes that is created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof;\nAn estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source; or\nA trust, if (1) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust; or (2) the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.\nA Shareholder (other than a partnership or other entity subject to tax as a partnership) that is not a U.S. Shareholder as defined above is generally considered a Non-U.S.\nShareholder for purposes of this discussion. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the treatment of any beneficial owner of an interest in a partnership, including any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, will generally depend upon the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership. Partnerships and partners in partnerships should consult their tax advisors about the U.S. federal income tax consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of Shares.\nTaxation of GLDM\nGLDM is treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. There can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will agree with that treatment, and it is possible that the IRS or another tax authority could assert a position contrary thereto and that a court could sustain that contrary position. If GLDM were found not to be taxable as a grantor trust, the Sponsor would likely terminate and liquidate GLDM. The balance of this disclosure assumes that GLDM will be treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nAs a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes, neither the Trust nor GLDM itself will pay U.S. federal income tax. Instead, the income and expenses of GLDM flow through to the Shareholders, and the Administrator will report GLDMs income, gains, losses and deductions to the IRS on that basis.\nTaxation of U.S. Shareholders\nU.S. Shareholders generally will be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as if they directly owned a pro rata share of the underlying assets held in GLDM. U.S. Shareholders also will be treated as if they directly derived their respective pro rata shares of the GLDMs income, if any, regardless of whether they receive any distributions from GLDM. Shareholders will also be treated as if they directly incurred their respective pro rata shares of GLDMs expenses. In the case of Shareholders that purchase Shares for cash, their initial tax basis in their pro rata share of the assets held in GLDM at the time they acquire their Shares will be equal to their cost of acquiring the Shares. In the case of a Shareholder that acquires his, her or its Shares by delivering gold bullion to GLDM, the delivery of gold bullion to GLDM in exchange for the underlying gold bullion represented by the Shares will not be a taxable event to the Shareholder, and the Shareholders tax basis and holding period for the Shareholders pro rata share of the gold bullion held in GLDM will be the same as the Shareholders tax basis and holding period for the gold bullion delivered in exchange therefor. For purposes of this discussion, it is assumed that all of a Shareholders Shares are acquired on the same date, at the same price per Share and, except where otherwise noted, that GLDMs sole asset is gold bullion.\nWhen GLDM sells gold bullion, for example to pay expenses, a Shareholder generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (1) the Shareholders pro rata share of the amount realized by GLDM upon the sale; and (2) the Shareholders tax basis for his, her or its pro rata share of the gold bullion that was sold, which gain or loss will generally be long-term or short-term capital gain or loss, depending upon whether the Shareholder is treated as having held his, her or its share of the gold bullion that was sold for more than one year. A Shareholders tax basis for his, her or its share of any gold bullion sold by GLDM generally will be determined by multiplying the Shareholders total tax basis for his, her or its share of all of the gold bullion held in GLDM immediately prior to the sale by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of gold bullion sold and the denominator of which is the total amount of the gold bullion held in GLDM immediately prior to the\nsale. After any such sale, a Shareholders tax basis for his, her or its pro rata share of the gold bullion remaining in GLDM will be equal to the Shareholders tax basis for his, her or its share of the total amount of the gold bullion held in GLDM immediately prior to the sale, less the portion of such tax basis allocable to the Shareholders share of the gold bullion that was sold.\nUpon a Shareholders sale of some or all of his, her or its Shares, the Shareholder will be treated as having sold the portion of his, her or its pro rata share of the gold bullion held in GLDM at the time of the sale that is attributable to the Shares sold. Accordingly, the Shareholder generally will recognize gain or loss on the sale in an amount equal to the difference between (1) the amount realized pursuant to the sale of the Shares, and (2) the Shareholders tax basis for the portion of its pro rata share of the gold bullion held in GLDM at the time of sale that is attributable to the Shares sold, as determined in the manner described in the preceding paragraph.\nA redemption of some or all of a Shareholders Shares in exchange for the underlying gold bullion represented by the Shares redeemed generally will not be a taxable event to the Shareholder. The Shareholders tax basis for the gold bullion received in the redemption generally will be the same as the Shareholders tax basis for the portion of his, her or its pro rata share of the gold bullion held in GLDM immediately prior to the redemption that is attributable to the Shares redeemed. The Shareholders holding period with respect to the gold bullion received should include the period during which the Shareholder held the Shares redeemed. A subsequent sale of the gold bullion received by the Shareholder will be a taxable event for U.S. federal income tax purposes, unless a nonrecognition provision of the Code applies to such sale.\nAfter any sale or redemption of less than all of a Shareholders Shares, the Shareholders tax basis for his, her or its pro rata share of the gold bullion held in GLDM immediately after such sale or redemption generally will be equal to the Shareholders tax basis for his, her or its share of the total amount of the gold bullion held in GLDM immediately prior to the sale or redemption, less the portion of such basis which is taken into account in determining the amount of gain or loss recognized by the Shareholder upon such sale or, in the case of a redemption, which is treated as the basis of the gold bullion received by the Shareholder in the redemption.\nAs noted above, the foregoing discussion assumes that all of a Shareholders Shares were acquired on the same date and at the same price per Share. If a Shareholder owns multiple lots of Shares (i.e.\n, Shares acquired on different dates and/or at different prices), it is uncertain whether the Shareholder may use the specific identification rules that apply under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1012-1(c)\nin the case of sales of shares of stock, in determining the amount, and the long-term or short-term character, of any gain or loss recognized by the Shareholder upon GLDMs sale of gold bullion, upon the Shareholders sale of any Shares, or upon the Shareholders sale of any gold bullion received by the Shareholder upon the redemption of any of the Shareholders Shares. The IRS could take the position that a Shareholder has a blended tax basis and holding period for his, her or its pro rata share of the underlying gold bullion in GLDM. Shareholders who or that hold multiple lots of Shares, or who or that are contemplating acquiring multiple lots of Shares, are urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the determination of the tax basis and holding period for the underlying gold bullion related to such Shares.\nMaximum 28% Long-Term Capital Gains Tax Rate for U.S. Shareholders Who are Individuals\nUnder current U.S. federal income tax law, gains recognized by non-corporate\nU.S. Shareholders from the sale of collectibles, including gold bullion, held for more than one year are taxed at a maximum rate of 28%, rather than the 20% rate applicable to most other long-term capital gains. However, if an individual U.S. Shareholder is otherwise subject to a rate lower than 28% if the gain was ordinary income due to being in a lower tax bracket, the 28% rate does not apply and the lower rate applies. For these purposes, gain recognized by a non-corporate\nU.S. Shareholder upon the sale of an interest in a trust that holds collectibles is treated as gain recognized on the sale of collectibles, to the extent that the gain is attributable to unrealized appreciation in value of the collectibles held by the trust. Therefore,\nany gain recognized by a non-corporate\nU.S. Shareholder attributable to a sale of Shares held for more than one year, or attributable to GLDMs sale of any gold bullion which the Shareholder is treated (through his, her or its ownership of Shares) as having held for more than one year, generally will be taxed at a maximum U.S. federal income tax rate of 28%; if the Shares or gold bullion sold is held (or treated as held) for one year or less, then any such gain so recognized would be taxed for U.S. federal income tax purposes at the same rate at which ordinary income is taxed.\n3.8% Tax on Net Investment Income\nCertain U.S. Shareholders who are individuals are required to pay a 3.8% tax on the lesser of the excess of their modified adjusted gross income over a threshold amount ($250,000 for married persons filing jointly and $200,000 for single taxpayers) or their net investment income, which generally includes dividends, interest, and net gains from the disposition of investment property. This tax is in addition to any regular U.S. federal income tax due on such investment income. A similar tax will apply to certain shareholders that are estates or trusts. U.S. Shareholders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, this law may have on an investment in the Shares.\nBrokerage Fees and Trust Expenses\nAny brokerage or other transaction fee incurred by a Shareholder in purchasing Shares will be treated as part of the Shareholders tax basis in the underlying assets of GLDM. Similarly, any brokerage fee incurred by a Shareholder in selling Shares will reduce the amount realized by the Shareholder with respect to the sale.\nShareholders will be required to recognize gain or loss upon a sale of gold bullion by GLDM (as discussed above), even though some or all of the proceeds of such sale are used by the Administrator to pay GLDMs expenses. Shareholders may deduct their respective pro rata shares of each expense incurred by GLDM to the same extent as if they directly incurred the expense. Shareholders who or that are individuals, estates or trusts, however, may be required to treat some or all of the expenses of GLDM as miscellaneous itemized deductions. Individuals may not deduct miscellaneous itemized deductions for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. For tax years beginning before January 1, 2018 and after December 31, 2025, individuals may deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions only to the extent they exceed 2% of adjusted gross income. In addition, such deductions may be subject to phase-outs and other limitations under applicable\nInvestment by Tax-Exempt\nU.S. Shareholders\nTax-Exempt\nU.S. Shareholders are subject to United States federal income tax only on their unrelated business taxable income (UBTI). Unless they incur debt in order to purchase Shares, it is expected that U.S. Tax-Exempt\nShareholders should not realize UBTI in respect of income or gains from the Shares. U.S. Tax-Exempt\nShareholders are urged to consult their own independent tax advisors regarding the United States federal income tax consequences of holding Shares in light of their particular circumstances.\nInvestment by Regulated Investment Companies\nMutual funds and other investment vehicles which are taxed as regulated investment companies within the meaning of section 851 of the Code are strongly urged to consult with their tax advisors concerning th likelihood that an investment in Shares will affect their qualification as a regulated investment company.\nInvestment by Certain Retirement Plans\nCode Section 408(m) provides that the acquisition of a collectible by an IRA, or a participant-directed account maintained under any plan that is tax-qualified\nunder Code section 401(a), is treated as a taxable\ndistribution from the account to the owner of the IRA, or to the participant for whom the plan account is maintained, of an amount equal to the cost to the account of acquiring the collectible. The IRS has issued private letter rulings to taxpayers, including an affiliate of the Sponsor, concluding that the purchase of shares in trusts similar to GLDM by an IRA owner or plan participant will not constitute the acquisition of a collectible or be treated as resulting in a taxable distribution to the IRA owner or plan participant under Code section 408(m). However, if any of the shares so purchased are distributed from an IRA or plan account to the IRA owner or plan participant, or if any gold received by such IRA or plan account upon the redemption of any of shares purchased by it is distributed (or treated as distributed under Code section 408(m)) to the IRA owner or plan participant, the shares or gold so distributed will be subject to U.S. federal income tax in the year of distribution, to the extent provided under the applicable provisions of Code section 408(d), 408(m) or 402. Private letter rulings are only binding on the IRS with respect to the taxpayer to which they are issued. GLDM has neither requested nor obtained, nor intends to request or obtain, such a private letter ruling. Accordingly, IRA owners and plan participants are strongly urged to consult with their tax advisors before directing any such accounts to invest in the Shares. See also ERISA and Related Considerations.\nU.S. Information Reporting and Backup Withholding for U.S. and Non-U.S.\nShareholders\nThe Administrator will file certain information returns with the IRS, and provide certain tax-related\ninformation to Shareholders, in connection with GLDM. The Administrator will make information available that will enable brokers and custodians through which investors hold Shares to prepare and, if required, file certain information returns (e.g., Form 1099) with the IRS. To the extent required by applicable regulations, each Shareholder will be provided with information regarding its allocable portion of GLDMs annual income, expenses, gains and losses (if any).\nA Shareholder may be subject to U.S. backup withholding tax in certain circumstances unless the Shareholder provides his, her or its taxpayer identification number and complies with certain certification procedures. Non-U.S.\nShareholders may have to comply with certification procedures to establish that they are not U.S. persons, and some Non-U.S.\nShareholders will be required to meet certain information reporting or certification requirements imposed by the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), in order to avoid certain information reporting and backup withholding tax requirements.\nThe amount of any backup withholding will be allowed as a credit against a Shareholders U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle such a Shareholder to a refund, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS.\nEstate and Gift Tax Considerations for Non-U.S.\nShareholders\nUnder the U.S. federal tax law, individuals who are neither citizens nor residents (as determined for U.S. federal estate and gift tax purposes) of the United States are subject to estate tax on all property that has a U.S. situs. Shares may well be considered to have a U.S. situs for these purposes. If they are, then Shares would be includible in the U.S. federal gross estate of an individual Non-U.S.\nShareholder. Currently, U.S. federal estate tax is imposed at rates of up to 40% of the fair market value of the taxable estate. The U.S. federal estate tax rate is subject to change in future years. In addition, the U.S. federal generation-skipping transfer tax may apply in certain circumstances. The estate of an individual Non-U.S.\nShareholder who is resident in a country that has an estate tax treaty with the United States may be entitled to benefit from such treaty.\nFor individual Non-U.S.\nShareholders, the U.S. federal gift tax generally applies only to gifts of tangible personal property or real property having a U.S. situs. Tangible personal property (including gold) has a U.S. situs if it is physically located in the United States. Although the matter is not settled, it appears that ownership of Shares should not be considered ownership of the underlying gold for this purpose, even to the extent that gold was held in custody in the United States. Instead, Shares should be considered\nintangible property, and therefore they should not be subject to U.S. federal gift tax if transferred during the holders lifetime. Individual Non-U.S.\nShareholders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the possible application of U.S. federal estate, gift and generation-skipping transfer taxes in their particular circumstances.\nTaxation in Jurisdictions Other than the United States\nPurchasers of Shares that are based in or acting out of a jurisdiction other than the United States are advised to consult his, her or its tax advisor as to the tax consequences under the laws of such jurisdiction (or any other jurisdiction not being the United States to which they are subject), of their purchase, holding, sale and redemption of or any other dealing in Shares and, in particular, as to whether any value added tax, other consumption tax or transfer tax is payable in relation to such purchase, holding, sale, redemption or other dealing.\nERISA AND RELATED CONSIDERATIONS\nThe Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), and Code section 4975 impose certain requirements on employee benefit plans and certain other plans and arrangements that are subject to ERISA or the Code section 4975, including IRAs and annuities, retirement plans for self-employed individuals (so-called\nKeogh plans), and certain collective investment funds and insurance company general or separate accounts in which such plans or arrangements are invested (collectively, the Plans), and on persons who are fiduciaries with respect to the investment of assets treated as plan assets of a Plan. Non-U.S.\nplans, government plans and some church plans are not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the provisions of Code section 4975, but may be subject to substantially similar rules under state, federal or other law (Similar Law).\nIn contemplating an investment of a portion of Plan assets in Shares, the Plan fiduciary responsible for making such investment should carefully consider, taking into account the facts and circumstances of the Plan, the Risk Factors discussed below and whether such investment is consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities, including, but not limited to (1) whether the fiduciary has the authority to make the investment under the appropriate governing plan instrument; (2) whether the investment would constitute a direct or indirect non-exempt\nprohibited transaction with a party in interest or disqualified person, as described in ERISA section 406 or Code section 4975, as applicable; (3) the Plans funding objectives; and (4) whether under the general fiduciary standards of investment prudence and diversification such investment is appropriate for the Plan, taking into account the overall investment policy of the Plan, the composition of the Plans investment portfolio, and the Plans need for sufficient liquidity to pay benefits when due. Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should consider carefully the risks described below before making an investment decision. You should also refer to the other information included in this report, including the Trusts and GLDMs financial statements and the related notes.\nRISKS RELATED TO GOLD\nThe sale of GLDMs gold bullion to pay expenses at a time of low gold prices could adversely affect the value of the Shares.\nThe Sponsor will sell gold bullion held by GLDM to pay GLDM expenses on an as-needed\nbasis irrespective of\nthen-current gold prices. GLDM is not actively managed and no attempt will be made to buy or sell gold bullion\nto protect against or to take advantage of fluctuations in the price of gold. Consequently, GLDMs gold bullion may be sold at a time when the gold price is low, resulting in a negative effect on the value of the Shares.\nAn adverse development may lead to a decrease in gold bullion trading prices.\nAn adverse development with respect to one or more factors such as global gold supply and demand, investors inflation expectations, exchange rate volatility and interest rate volatility may lead to a decrease in gold bullion trading prices. A decline in prices of gold would have a negative impact on the GLDMs NAV and the Shares.\nSubstantial sales of gold by the official sector could adversely affect an investment in the Shares.\nThe official sector consists of central banks, other governmental agencies and multi-lateral institutions that buy, sell and hold gold as part of their reserve assets. The official sector holds a significant amount of gold, most of which is static, meaning that it is held in vaults and is not bought, sold, leased or swapped or otherwise mobilized in the open market. In the event that future economic, political or social conditions or pressures require members of the official sector to liquidate their gold assets all at once or in an uncoordinated manner, the demand for gold might not be sufficient to accommodate the sudden increase in the supply of gold to the market. Consequently, the price of gold could decline significantly, which would adversely affect an investment in the Shares.\nCrises may motivate large-scale sales of gold, which could decrease the price of gold and adversely affect an investment in the Shares.\nThe possibility of large-scale distress sales of gold in times of crisis may have a negative impact on the price of gold and adversely affect an investment in the Shares. For example, the 2008 financial crisis resulted in significantly depressed prices of gold largely due to forced sales and deleveraging by institutional investors such as hedge funds and pension funds. Crises in the future may impair golds price performance, which would, in turn, adversely affect an investment in the Shares.\nPurchasing activity in the gold market associated with the delivery of gold bullion to GLDM in exchange for Creation Units may cause a temporary increase in the price of gold, which may adversely affect an investment in the Shares.\nPurchasing activity associated with acquiring the gold bullion required for deposit into GLDM in connection with the creation of Creation Units may temporarily increase the market price of gold, which would likely result in higher prices for the Shares. Temporary increases in the market price of gold may also occur as a result of the purchasing activity of other market participants. Other market participants may attempt to benefit from an increase in the market price of gold that may result from increased purchasing activity of gold connected with the issuance of Creation Units. Consequently, the market price of gold may decline immediately after Creation Units are created. If the price of gold declines, it will have a negative impact on the value of the Shares.\nThe price of gold may be affected by the sale of gold by exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or other exchange-traded vehicles tracking gold markets.\nTo the extent existing ETFs or other exchange-traded vehicles tracking gold markets represent a significant proportion of demand for physical gold bullion, large redemptions of the securities of these ETFs or other exchange traded vehicles could negatively affect physical gold bullion prices and the price and NAV of the Shares.\nThe value of the gold bullion held by GLDM is determined using the LBMA Gold Price PM. Potential discrepancies in the calculation of the LBMA Gold Price, as well as any future changes to the LBMA Gold Price, could offset the value of the gold bullion held by GLDM and could have an adverse effect on the methodology used to calculate the investment in the Shares.\nThe LBMA Gold Price is determined twice each Business Day (10:30 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. London time) by the participants in a physically settled, electronic and tradable auction administered by the IBA. The IBA oversees a bidding process that determines the price of gold by matching buy and sell orders submitted by the participants for the applicable auction time. GLDMs NAV is determined each day that\nthe NYSE Arca is open for regular trading, based on the price of gold per ounce applied against the number of ounces of gold owned by GLDM. In determining the NAV, the Administrator generally will value the gold bullion held by GLDM using the LBMA Gold Price PM.\nIn the event that the LBMA Gold Price does not prove to be an accurate benchmark and the LBMA Gold Price varies materially from the price determined by other mechanisms, the NAV of GLDM and the value of an investment in the Shares could be adversely affected. Any future developments in the benchmark, to the extent they have a material impact on the LBMA Gold Price, could adversely affect the NAV of GLDM and the value of an investment in the Shares.\nFurther, the calculation of the LBMA Gold Price is not an exact process. Rather, it is based upon a procedure of matching orders from participants in the auction process and their customers to sell gold with orders from participants in the auction process and their customers to buy gold at particular prices. The LBMA Gold Price does not therefore purport to reflect each buyer or seller of gold in the market, nor does it purport to set a definitive price for gold at which all orders for sale or purchase will take place on that particular day or time. All orders placed into the auction process by the participants will be executed on the basis of the price determined pursuant to the LBMA Gold Price auction process (provided that orders may be cancelled, increased or decreased while the auction is in progress). It is possible that electronic failures or other unanticipated events may occur that could result in delays in the announcement of, or the inability of the system to produce, an LBMA Gold Price on any given date.\nIf concerns about the integrity or reliability of the LBMA Gold Price arise, even if eventually shown to be without merit, such concerns could adversely affect investor interest in gold and therefore adversely affect the price of gold and the value of an investment in the Shares. Because the NAV of GLDM is determined using the LBMA Gold Price, discrepancies in or manipulation of the calculation of the LBMA Gold Price could have an adverse impact on the value of an investment in the Shares. Furthermore, any concern about the integrity or reliability of the pricing mechanism could disrupt trading in gold and products using the LBMA Gold Price, such as the Shares. In addition, these concerns could potentially lead to both changes in the manner in which the LBMA Gold Price is calculated and/or the discontinuance of the LBMA Gold Price altogether. Each of these factors could lead to less liquidity or greater price volatility for gold and products using the LBMA Gold Price, such as the Shares, or otherwise could have an adverse impact on the trading price of the Shares.\nBecause GLDM invests only in gold, an investment in GLDM may be more volatile than an investment in a more broadly diversified portfolio.\nGLDM invests only in gold. As a result, GLDMs holdings are not diversified. Accordingly, the GLDMs NAV may be more volatile than another investment vehicle with a more broadly diversified portfolio and may fluctuate substantially over short or long periods of time. The price of gold can be volatile because gold is comparatively less liquid than other commodities. Fluctuations in the price of gold are expected to have a direct impact on the value of the Shares.\nAn investment in GLDM may be deemed speculative and is not intended as a complete investment program. An investment in the Shares should be considered only by persons financially able to maintain their investment and who can bear the risk of loss associated with an investment in GLDM. Investors should review closely the objective and strategy and redemption provisions of GLDM, as discussed herein, and familiarize themselves with the risks associated with an investment in GLDM.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE CUSTODY OF GOLD\nGLDM relies on the Custodian for the safekeeping of its gold bullion. Failure by the Custodian to exercise due care in the safekeeping of GLDMs gold bullion could result in a loss to GLDM.\nGLDM relies on the Custodian for the safekeeping of essentially all of its gold bullion. The Administrator is not liable for the acts or omissions of the Custodian. The Administrator has no obligation to monitor the activities of the Custodian other than to receive and review reports prepared\nby the Custodian pursuant to the Custody Agreements. In addition, the ability to monitor the performance of the Custodian may be limited because under the Custody Agreements, the Trust and the Sponsor and any accountants or other inspectors selected by the Sponsor have only limited rights to visit the premises of the Custodian for the purpose of examining the GLDMs gold bullion and certain related records maintained by the Custodian. As a result of the above, any failure by the Custodian to exercise due care in the safekeeping of GLDMs gold bullion may not be detectable or controllable by the Administrator and could result in a loss to GLDM.\nFailure by a subcustodian to exercise due care in the safekeeping of GLDMs gold bullion bars could result in a loss to GLDM.\nUnder the Allocated Bullion Account Agreement, the Custodian agreed that it will hold all of GLDMs gold bullion bars in its own vault premises except when the gold bullion bars have been allocated in a vault other than the Custodians vault premises, and in such cases the Custodian agreed that it will use commercially reasonable efforts promptly to transport the gold bullion bars to the Custodians vault, at the Custodians cost and risk. Nevertheless, there will be periods of time when some portion of GLDMs gold bullion bars will be held by one or more subcustodians appointed by the Custodian.\nThe Custodian is required under the Allocated Bullion Account Agreement to use reasonable care in appointing their subcustodians and will monitor the conduct of each of their subcustodians, and promptly advise the Trust of any difficulties or problems existing with respect to such subcustodian. However, the gold bullion held by a subcustodian is held in the name of the Custodian, and not in the name of GLDM, and the account with each subcustodian is only subject to the Custodians instructions. In the event a subcustodian fails to exercise due care in the safekeeping of GLDMs gold bullion, there could be a resulting loss, and GLDM may have limited or no ability to pursue any action against the subcustodian. See Description of the GLDM Custody Agreements for more information about subcustodians that may hold GLDMs gold bullion.\nThe ability of the Administrator and the Custodian to take legal action against subcustodians may be limited, which increases the possibility that GLDM may suffer a loss if a subcustodian does not use due care in the safekeeping of GLDMs gold bullion bars.\nIf any subcustodian that holds gold bullion on a temporary basis does not exercise due care in the safekeeping of GLDMs gold bullion bars, the ability of the Trust or the Custodian to recover damages against such subcustodian may be limited to only such recourse, if any, as may be available under applicable English law or, if the subcustodian is not located in England, under other applicable law. This is because there are expected to be no written contractual arrangements between subcustodians who may hold GLDMs gold bullion bars and the Trust or the Custodian, as the case may be. If the Trusts or the Custodians recourse against the subcustodian is so limited, GLDM may not be adequately compensated for the loss. For more information on the Trusts and the Custodian ability to seek recovery against subcustodians and the subcustodians duty to safekeep GLDMs gold bullion bars, see Description of the GLDM Custody Agreements.\nGold bullion held in GLDMs unallocated gold bullion account and any Authorized Participants unallocated gold bullion account is not segregated from the Custodians assets. If the Custodian becomes insolvent, its assets may not be adequate to satisfy a claim by GLDM or any Authorized Participant. In addition, in the event of the Custodians insolvency, there may be a delay and costs incurred in identifying the gold bullion bars held in GLDMs allocated gold bullion account.\nGold bullion that is part of a deposit for a purchase order or part of a redemption distribution, or which is transferred into or out of GLDM pursuant to the Gold Delivery Agreement, is held for a time in the Unallocated Account and in the case of creations and redemptions, previously or subsequently, in the Authorized Participant Unallocated Account of the purchasing or redeeming Authorized Participant. During those times, GLDM and the Authorized Participant, as the case may be, will have no proprietary rights to any specific bars of gold bullion held by the Custodian and will each be an unsecured creditor of\nthe Custodian with respect to the amount of gold bullion held in such unallocated accounts. In addition, if the Custodian fails to allocate GLDMs gold bullion in a timely manner, in the proper amounts or otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Unallocated Bullion Account Agreement, or if a subcustodian fails to so segregate gold bullion held by it on behalf of GLDM, unallocated gold bullion will not be segregated from the Custodians assets, and GLDM will be an unsecured creditor of the Custodian with respect to the amount so held in the event of the insolvency of the Custodian. In the event the Custodian becomes insolvent, the Custodians assets might not be adequate to satisfy a claim by GLDM or the Authorized Participant for the amount of gold bullion held in their respective unallocated gold bullion accounts.\nIn the event of the insolvency of the Custodian, a liquidator may seek to freeze access to the gold bullion held in all of the accounts held by the Custodian, including the Allocated Account. Although GLDM would retain legal title to the allocated gold bullion bars, it could incur expenses in connection with obtaining control of the allocated gold bullion bars, and the assertion of a claim by such liquidator for unpaid fees due to the Custodian could delay creations and redemptions of Creation Units.\nThe lack of diversification of vault premises for the physical gold bullion held by the Custodian could result in significant losses to GLDM if the gold bullion held at such premises is lost, damaged, stolen or inaccessible.\nUnless otherwise agreed between GLDM and the Custodian, custody of the gold bullion deposited with and held for the account of GLDM is provided by the Custodian at its London, England vaults or, when gold bullion has been allocated in a vault other than the Custodians London vault premises, by or for any subcustodian employed by the Custodian for the temporary custody and safekeeping of gold bullion until it can be transported to the Custodians London vault premises. The lack of diversification of vault premises could result in significant losses to GLDM if its gold bullion bars held by the Custodian or any subcustodian on behalf of GLDM at any single location are lost, damaged, or stolen. The lack of diversification of vault premises could also result in significant losses if the gold bullion held at a single location becomes inaccessible for a substantial period of time due to natural events (such as an earthquake) or human actions (such as a terrorist attack).\nThe Custodian is authorized to appoint from time to time one or more subcustodians to hold GLDMs gold bullion until it can be transported to the Custodians vaults.\nThe gold bullion custody operations of the Custodian are not subject to specific governmental regulatory supervision.\nThe Custodian is responsible for the safekeeping of GLDMs gold bullion and also facilitates the transfer of gold bullion into and out of GLDM. Although the Custodian is a market maker, clearer and approved weigher under the rules of the LBMA (which sets out good practices for participants in the bullion market), the LBMA is not an official or governmental regulatory body. Furthermore, although the Custodian is generally regulated in the UK by the Prudential Regulatory Authority and the FCA, such regulations do not directly cover the Custodians gold bullion custody operations in the UK. Accordingly, GLDM is dependent on the Custodian to comply with the best practices of the LBMA and to implement satisfactory internal controls for their gold bullion custody operations to keep GLDMs gold bullion secure.\nRISKS RELATED TO TAXES\nIf a U.S. investor who or that is an individual, estate or trust (each referred to in this paragraph and the next paragraph as an individual) sells or exchanges the Shares held for more than a year, any gain recognized on the sale or exchange generally will be subject to federal income tax at a maximum rate of 28% rather than the lower maximum rates applicable to most other long-term capital gains an individual recognizes.\nGains recognized by an individual from the sale of collectibles, which term includes gold held for more than one year, are subject to federal income tax at a maximum rate of 28% rather than the lower\nmaximum rates applicable to most other long-term capital gains individuals recognize (currently a maximum of 20% for individuals). For these purposes, a gain that an individual recognizes on the sale of an interest in a grantor trust that holds collectibles (such as the Trust) is treated as a gain recognized on the sale of the collectibles, to the extent the gain is attributable to unrealized appreciation in value of the collectibles. Therefore, any gain recognized by an individual U.S. investor attributable to a sale or exchange of shares held for more than one year, or attributable to the sale of any gold that the investor is treated (through its ownership of shares) as having held for more than one year, generally will be subject to federal income tax at a maximum rate of 28%. The tax rates for capital gains recognized on the sale of assets held by an individual U.S. investor for one year or less, or by a taxpayer other than an individual, are generally the same as those at which ordinary income is taxed.\nU.S. shareholders will be required to recognize a gain or loss upon a sale of gold by GLDM, even though some or all of the proceeds of such sale are used by the Sponsor to pay expenses. U.S. shareholders may deduct their respective pro rata shares of each expense incurred by GLDM to the same extent as if they directly incurred such an expense. U.S. shareholders who are individuals, estates or trusts, however, may be required to treat some or all of the expenses of GLDM as miscellaneous itemized deductions. An individual may not deduct miscellaneous itemized deductions for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. For tax years beginning before January 1, 2018 and after December 31, 2025, individuals may deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions only to the extent they exceed 2% of adjusted gross income. In addition, such deductions may be subject to phase-outs and other limitations under applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereunder and, if the U.S. shareholder is an individual subject to the alternative minimum tax, may not be deductible at all.\nGENERAL RISKS\nGLDM is exposed to various operational risks.\nGLDM is exposed to various operational risks, including human error, information technology failures and failure to comply with formal procedures intended to mitigate these risks, and is particularly dependent on electronic means of communicating, record-keeping and otherwise conducting business. In addition, GLDM generally exculpates, and in some cases indemnifies, counterparties with respect to losses arising from unforeseen circumstances and events, which may include the interruption, suspension or restriction of trading on or the closure of NYSE Arca, power or other mechanical or technological failures or interruptions, computer viruses, communications disruptions, work stoppages, natural disasters, fire, war, terrorism, riots, rebellions or other circumstances beyond its or its counterparties control. Accordingly, GLDM generally bears the risk of loss with respect to these unforeseen circumstances and events to the extent relating to GLDM or the Shares.\nAlthough it is expected that the GLDMs direct counterparties will generally have disaster recovery or similar programs or safeguards in place to mitigate the effect of such unforeseen circumstances and events, these safeguards may not be in place for all parties whose activities may affect the performance of GLDM, and these safeguards, even if implemented, may not be successful in preventing losses associated with such unforeseen circumstances and events. Moreover, the systems and applications on which GLDM relies may not continue to operate as intended. In addition to potentially causing performance failures at, or direct losses to, GLDM, any such unforeseen circumstances and events or operational failures may further distract the counterparties or personnel on which GLDM relies, reducing their ability to conduct the activities on which GLDM is dependent. These risks cannot be fully mitigated or prevented, and further efforts or expenditures to do so may not be cost-effective, whether due to reduced benefits from implementing additional or redundant safeguards or due to increases in associated maintenance requirements and other expenses that may make it more costly for GLDM to operate in more typical circumstances.\nGLDM as well as the Sponsor and its service providers are vulnerable to the effects of geopolitical events and the continuation of the war in Ukraine or other hostilities.\nGeopolitical events and the continuation of the hostilities in Ukraine or other hostilities could disrupt and potentially impact the business activities of the Sponsor and its service providers and have an adverse effect on GLDM.\nIn late February 2022, Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine, significantly amplifying already existing geopolitical tensions among Russia and other countries in the region and in the west. On March 7, 2022, the LBMA suspended its accreditation of six Russian precious metals refiners. The LBMA stated that existing bars produced by the refiners before their suspension will still be accepted as good delivery. Following an announcement at the G7 Summit to collectively ban the import of Russian gold, the UK passed regulations which prohibit the direct or indirect (i) import of gold that originated in Russia, (ii) acquisition of gold that originated in Russia or is located in Russia and (iii) supply or delivery of gold that originated in Russia, all after July 21, 2022. Similarly, US regulations prohibit the import of gold of Russian origin into the United States on or after June 28, 2022 and EU regulations prohibit the direct or indirect import, purchase or transfer of gold if it originates in Russia and has been exported from Russia after July 22, 2022.\nThe responses of countries and political bodies to Russias actions, the larger overarching tensions, and Ukraines military response and the potential for wider conflict may increase financial market volatility generally, have adverse effects on regional and global economic markets, and cause volatility in the price of gold and the price of the Shares. In addition, the conflict in Ukraine, along with global political fallout and implications including sanctions, shipping disruptions, collateral war damage, and a potential expansion of the conflict beyond Ukraines borders, could disturb the gold market.\nGLDM as well as the Sponsor and its service providers are vulnerable to the effects of public health crises, including the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic (the COVID-19\npandemic).\nPandemics and other public health crises may cause a curtailment of business activities which may potentially impact the ability of the Sponsor and its service providers to operate. The COVID-19\npandemic or a similar public health threat could adversely impact GLDM by causing operating delays and disruptions, market disruption and shutdowns (including as a result of government regulation and prevention measures). The COVID-19\npandemic has had and will likely continue to have serious negative effects on social, economic and financial systems, including significant uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets. To date, the impact of COVID-19\nhas not materially affected the operations of GLDM.\nThe service providers engaged by GLDM may not carry adequate insurance to cover claims against them by GLDM, which could adversely affect the value of net assets of GLDM.\nThe Administrator, the Custodian, and other service providers engaged by GLDM maintain such insurance as they deem adequate with respect to their respective businesses. Shareholders cannot be assured that any of the aforementioned parties will maintain any insurance with respect to the GLDMs assets held or the services that such parties provide to GLDM and, if they maintain insurance, that such insurance is sufficient to satisfy any losses incurred by them in respect of their relationship with GLDM. Accordingly, the GLDM will have to rely on the efforts of the service provider to recover from their insurer compensation for any losses incurred by GLDM in connection with such arrangements.\nGLDMs obligation to indemnify certain of its service providers could adversely affect an investment in the Shares.\nGLDM has agreed to indemnify certain of its service providers, including the Custodian, the Sponsor and the Trustee, for certain liabilities incurred by such parties in connection with their respective agreements to provide services for GLDM. In the event GLDM is required to indemnify any of its service providers, it may be required to sell gold bullion to cover such expenses and the NAV would be reduced accordingly, thus adversely affecting an investment in the Shares.\nPotential conflicts of interest may arise among the Sponsor or its affiliates and GLDM.\nThe Sponsor manages the business and affairs of GLDM. Conflicts of interest may arise among the Sponsor and its affiliates, on the one hand, and GLDM and its shareholders, on the other hand. As a result of these conflicts, the Sponsor may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over GLDM and its shareholders. These potential conflicts include, among others:\nThe Trust, on behalf of GLDM, has agreed to indemnify the Sponsor and its affiliates pursuant to the terms of the Declaration of Trust.\nThe Sponsor, its affiliates and their officers and employees are not prohibited from engaging in other businesses or activities, including those that might be in direct competition with GLDM.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE SHARES\nGLDM is a passive investment vehicle and is not actively managed.\nGLDM does not manage its portfolios to sell gold bullion at times when its price is high or acquire gold bullion at low prices in the expectation of future price increases. Also, GLDM does not use any of the hedging techniques available to professional gold investors to attempt to reduce the risks of losses resulting from gold price decreases. Any losses sustained by GLDM will adversely affect the value of the Shares.\nThe costs inherent in buying or selling Shares may detract significantly from investment results.\nBuying or selling Shares on an exchange involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions effectuated on an exchange. When buying or selling Shares through a broker or other intermediary, you will likely incur a brokerage commission or other charges imposed by that broker or intermediary. In addition, you may incur the cost of the spread, that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Shares (the bid price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Shares (the ask price). Because of the costs inherent in buying or selling Shares, frequent trading may detract significantly from investment results and an investment in Shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments.\nThe lack of an active trading market or a halt in trading of the Shares may result in losses on investment at the time of disposition of the Shares.\nAlthough the Shares are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, we cannot guarantee that an active trading market for the Shares will be maintained. If an investor needs to sell Shares at a time when no active market for the Shares exists, or there is a halt in trading of securities generally or of the Shares, this will most likely adversely affect the price the investor receives for the Shares (assuming the investor is able to sell them).\nThe Shares may trade at a price that is at, above or below the NAV per Share and any discount or premium in the trading price relative to the NAV per Share may widen as a result of non-concurrent\ntrading hours between the COMEX and NYSE Arca.\nThe Shares may trade at, above or below the NAV per Share. The NAV per Share fluctuates with changes in the market value of the GLDMs assets. The trading price of the Shares fluctuates in accordance with changes in the NAV per Share as well as market supply and demand. The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the NAV per Share may be influenced by non-concurrent\ntrading hours between the COMEX and NYSE Arca. While the Shares trade on NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. New York time, liquidity in the global gold market may be reduced after the close of the COMEX at 1:30 p.m. New York time. As a result, after 1:30 p.m. New York time, trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount, on the Shares may widen.\nHowever, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at NAV (unlike shares of many closed-end\nfunds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to,\ntheir NAVs), the Sponsor believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of GLDM are not likely to be sustained over the long term. While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely that the Shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the GLDMs next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with the GLDMs NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at market makers or Authorized Participants, or to market participants or during periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for the Shares that differ significantly from GLDMs NAV.\nIf the process of creation and redemption of Creation Units encounters any unanticipated difficulties, the possibility for arbitrage transactions intended to keep the price of the Shares closely linked to the price of gold may not exist and, as a result, the price of the Shares may fall.\nIf the process for the creation and redemption of shares by Authorized Participants (which depends on, among other things, timely transfers of gold bullion to and by the Custodian) encounter any unanticipated difficulties, potential market participants who would otherwise be willing to purchase or redeem Creation Units to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities may not do so. If this is the case, the liquidity of the Shares may decline and the price of the Shares may fluctuate independently of the price of gold and may fall.\nThe value of the Shares could decline if unanticipated operational or trading problems arise.\nThere may be unanticipated problems or issues with respect to the mechanics of the GLDMs operations and the trading of the Shares that could have a material adverse effect on an investment in the Shares. In addition, to the extent that unanticipated operational or trading problems or issues arise, the Sponsors past experience and qualifications may not be suitable for solving these problems or issues.\nThe amount of gold represented by the Shares will continue to be reduced during the life of GLDM due to the sales of gold bullion necessary to pay expenses irrespective of whether the trading price of the Shares rises or falls in response to changes in the price of gold.\nEach outstanding Share represents a fractional, undivided interest in the gold bullion held by GLDM. GLDM does not generate any income and regularly sells gold bullion to pay for its ongoing expenses. Therefore, the amount of gold bullion represented by each Share will gradually decline over time. This is also true with respect to Shares that are issued in exchange for additional deposits of gold bullion into GLDM, as the amount of gold bullion required to create Shares proportionately reflects the amount of gold bullion represented by the Shares outstanding at the time of creation. Assuming a constant gold price, the trading price of the Shares is expected to gradually decline relative to the price of gold as the amount of gold bullion represented by the Shares gradually declines.\nInvestors should be aware that the gradual decline in the amount of gold bullion represented by the Shares will occur regardless of whether the trading price of the Shares rises or falls in response to changes in the price of gold. GLDM may be subject to certain liabilities (for example, as a result of litigation) that have not been assumed by the Sponsor. GLDM will sell gold bullion to pay those expenses, unless the Sponsor agrees to pay such expenses out of its own pocket.\nAn investment in the Shares may be adversely affected by competition from other methods of investing in gold.\nGLDM competes with other financial vehicles, including traditional debt and equity securities issued by companies in the gold industry and other securities backed by or linked to gold, direct investments in gold and investment vehicles similar to GLDM. Market and financial conditions, and other conditions beyond the Sponsors control, may make it more attractive to invest in other financial vehicles or to invest in gold directly, which could limit the market for the Shares and reduce the liquidity of the Shares.\nGLDM may be required to terminate and liquidate at a time that is disadvantageous to shareholders.\nIf GLDM is required to terminate and liquidate, such termination and liquidation could occur at a time that is disadvantageous to shareholders, such as when gold prices are lower than the gold prices at the\ntime when shareholders purchased their Shares. In such a case, when GLDMs gold bullion is sold as part of the liquidation, the resulting proceeds distributed to shareholders will be fewer than if gold prices were higher at the time of sale.\nRedemption orders may be subject to rejection, suspension or postponement.\nGLDM has the right, but not the obligation, to reject any Redemption Order if (i) the order is not in proper form as described in the Participant Agreement, (ii) the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of its counsel, might be unlawful, (iii) it determines that acceptance of the order from an Authorized Participant would expose it to credit risk, or (iv) circumstances outside the control of the Administrator, the Sponsor or the Custodian make the redemption, for all practical purposes, not feasible to process.\nGLDM may, in its discretion, and will, when directed by the Sponsor, suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the redemption settlement date for: (1) any period during which NYSE Arca is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings, or trading on NYSE Arca is suspended or restricted, (2) any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which delivery, disposal or evaluation of gold bullion is not reasonably practicable, or (3) such other period as the Sponsor determines to be necessary for the protection of the shareholders.\nThe Sponsor will not be liable to any person or liable in any way for any loss or damages that may result from any such rejection, suspension or postponement.\nLoss of intellectual property rights related to GLDM, or competing claims over ownership of those rights, could adversely affect GLDM and an investment in the Shares.\nWhile the Sponsor believes that all intellectual property rights needed to operate GLDM are owned by or licensed to the Sponsor or an affiliate or have been obtained, third parties may allege or assert ownership of intellectual property rights that may be related to the design, structure and operations of GLDM. To the extent any claims of such ownership are brought, or any proceedings are instituted to assert such claims, the negotiation, litigation or settlement of such claims, or the ultimate disposition of such claims in a court of law if a suit is brought, may adversely affect GLDM and an investment in the Shares, for example, resulting in expenses or damages or the termination of GLDM.\nThe liquidity of the Shares may be affected by the withdrawal of Authorized Participants and substantial redemptions by Authorized Participants.\nIn the event that one or more Authorized Participants that has substantial interests in the Shares withdraws from participation, the liquidity of the Shares will likely decrease, which could adversely affect the market price of the Shares. The liquidity of the Shares also may be affected by substantial redemptions by Authorized Participants related to or independent of the withdrawal from participation of Authorized Participants. If there are substantial redemptions of Shares or one or more Authorized Participants with a substantial interest in the Shares withdraws from participation, the liquidity of the Shares will likely decrease, which could adversely affect the market price of the Shares and result in your incurring a loss on your investment.\nShareholders do not have the rights enjoyed by investors in certain other vehicles.\nAs interests in an investment trust, the Shares have none of the statutory rights normally associated with the ownership of shares of a corporation (including, for example, the right to bring oppression or derivative actions). In addition, the Shares have limited voting and distribution rights (for example, Shareholders do not have the right to elect directors and will not receive dividends).\nShareholders do not have the protections associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the protections afforded by the Commodity Exchange Act.\nThe Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and is not required to register under such act. Consequently, shareholders do not have the regulatory protections provided to investors in registered investment companies.\nFurthermore, GLDM is not a commodity pool for purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act (the CEA), and none of the Sponsor, the Trustee, or the Marketing Agent is subject to regulation by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission as a commodity pool operator in connection with the Shares or a commodity trading advisor in connection with the Shares. Consequently, holders of the Shares do not have the regulatory protections provided to investors in CEA-regulated\ninstruments or commodity pools. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNot applicable.

[Reserved] Item 7. Management\ns Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nTrust Overview\nThe World Gold Trust (the Trust) was formed as a Delaware statutory trust on August 27, 2014. The Trust consists of multiple series (each, a Fund and collectively, the Funds). Each Fund issues common units of beneficial interest that represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of such Fund. The term of the Trust and each Fund is perpetual (unless terminated earlier in certain circumstances). The Trust was organized in separate series as a Delaware statutory trust rather than as separate statutory trusts to achieve certain administrative and other efficiencies. The Trust is sponsored by WGC USA Asset Management Company, LLC (the Sponsor).\nThe Trust established six separate series, of which only SPDR\u00ae Gold MiniShares\u00ae Trust (GLDM) is operational as of September 30, 2022. GLDM commenced operations on June 26, 2018. GLDMs investment objective is for its shares (the Shares) to reflect the performance of the price of gold, less its expenses.\nInvesting in the Shares does not insulate the investor from risks, including price volatility. The following chart illustrates the movement in the market price of the Shares and NAV of the Shares against the corresponding gold price (per 1/100 of an oz. of gold) since the day the Shares first began trading on the NYSE Arca:\nShare price & NAV v. gold price-June 26, 2018 to September 30, 2022\nCritical Accounting Policy\nValuation of Gold, Definition of Net Asset Value\nGLDM values the investment in gold bullion at fair value. BNY Mellon Asset Servicing, a division of The Bank of New York Mellon (the Administrator), will value any gold bullion held by GLDM on the basis of the price of an ounce of gold as determined by the IBA. In determining the NAV, the Administrator will value the gold bullion held by GLDM on the basis of the LBMA Gold Price PM. The Administrator will calculate the NAV on each day the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading, at the earlier LBMA Gold Price PM for the day or 12:00 PM New York time. If no LBMA Gold Price (AM or PM) is made on a particular evaluation day or if the LBMA Gold Price PM has not been announced by 12:00 PM New York time on a particular evaluation day, the next most recent LBMA Gold Price AM or PM will be used in the determination of the NAV, unless the Sponsor determines that such price is inappropriate to use as the basis for such determination. Gold held by GLDM is reported at fair value on the Statement of Financial Condition.\nOnce the value of the gold has been determined, the Administrator subtracts all estimated accrued expenses and other liabilities of GLDM from the total value of the gold and all other assets of GLDM. The resulting figure is the NAV. The NAV is used to compute the Sponsors fee. The Administrator determines the NAV per Share by dividing the NAV of GLDM by the number of Shares outstanding as of the close of trading on NYSE Arca.\nInspectorate conducts two counts each year of the gold bullion held on behalf of the Trust at the vaults of the Custodian. A complete bar count is conducted once per year and coincides with the Trusts financial year end at September 30th\n. On October 6, 2022, Inspectorate concluded the annual full count of the Trusts gold bullion held by the Custodian. The second count is a random sample count and is conducted at a date which falls within the same financial year and was conducted most recently on May 4, 2022. The results can be found on www.spdrgoldshares.com\n. The Sponsor generally visits the vaults of the Custodian twice a year as part of its due diligence procedures.\nThe table below summarizes the impact of unrealized appreciation on GLDMs gold holdings at September 30, 2022 and 2021:\n(Amount in 000s of US$)\nSep-30,\nSep-30,\nInvestment in gold - cost\n$ 4,864,729\n$ 4,237,696\nUnrealized appreciation/(depreciation) on investment in gold\n(172,342 )\n150,035\nInvestment in gold - market value\n$ 4,692,387\n$ 4,387,731\nReview of Financial Results\nFinancial Highlights\n(All amounts in the following table and the subsequent paragraphs,\nare in 000s of US$)\nFor the year ended\nSep-30,\nFor the year ended\nSep-30,\nFor the year ended\nSep-30,\nNet realized and change in unrealized gain/(loss) on investment in gold\n$ (289,201 )\n$ (338,455 )\n$ 446,656\nNet income\n$ (295,357 )\n$ (345,917 )\n$ 443,161\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\nGLDMs net realized and change in unrealized loss on investment in gold for the year ended September 30, 2022 of $(289,201) is made up of a realized gain of $394 from the sale of gold to pay Sponsor fees, a realized gain of $32,782 from gold distributed for the redemption of shares, and a change in unrealized depreciation of $(322,377) on investment in gold.\nGLDMs net realized and change in unrealized loss on investment in gold for the year ended September 30, 2021 of $(338,455) is made up of a realized gain of $634 from the sale of gold to pay Sponsor fees, a realized gain of $39,311 from gold distributed for the redemption of shares, and a change in unrealized depreciation of $(378,400) on investment in gold.\nGLDMs net realized and change in unrealized gain on investment in gold for the year ended September 30, 2020 of $446,656 is made up of a realized gain of $455 from the sale of gold to pay Sponsor fees, a realized gain of $37,008 from gold distributed for the redemption of shares, and a change in unrealized appreciation of $409,193 on investment in gold.\nSelected Supplemental Data\nYear ended\nSep-30, 2022\nYear ended\nSep-30, 2021\nYear ended\nSep-30, 2020\nOunces of Gold:\nOpening balance\n2,517,632.7\n1,877,680.9\n697,523.6\nCreations (excluding gold receivable at September 30, 2022 - 0; September 30, 2021-0 and September 30, 2020-9,959.7)\n917,800.7\n893,821.8\n1,355,433.7\nRedemptions (excluding gold payable at September 30, 2022 - 31,570.5; September 30, 2021 - 0 and September 30, 2020 - 0)\n(625,024.9 )\n(249,855.2 )\n(173,448.7 )\nSales of gold\n(3,537.3 )\n(4,014.8 )\n(1,827.7 )\nClosing balance\n2,806,871.2\n2,517,632.7\n1,877,680.9\nGold price per ounce - LBMA Gold Price PM\n$ 1,671.75\n$ 1,742.80\n$ 1,886.90\nMarket value of gold holdings (in 000s)\n$ 4,692,387\n$ 4,387,731\n$ 3,542,996\nNumber of Shares (in 000s):\nOpening balance\n126,600\n94,750\n35,450\nCreations\n46,200\n44,400\n68,000\nRedemptions .\n(33,050 )\n(12,550 )\n(8,700 )\nClosing balance\n139,750\n126,600\n94,750\nShare values adjusted per reverse stock split effective Feb. 23, 2022\nIn the year ended September 30, 2022, 46,200,000 Shares (462 Creation Units) were created in exchange for 917,800.7 ounces of gold, 33,050,000 Shares (330 Creation Units) were redeemed in exchange for 656,595.4 ounces of gold and 3,537.3 ounces of gold were sold to pay Sponsor fees. For accounting purposes, GLDM reflects creations and redemptions on the date of receipt of a notification of a creation but does not issue Shares until the requisite amount of gold is received. Upon a redemption, GLDM delivers gold upon receipt of Shares. These creations were completed in the normal course of business.\nAs at September 30, 2022, the amount of gold owned by GLDM and held by the custodian in its vault was 2,806,871.2 ounces, 100% of which is allocated gold in the form of London Good Delivery gold bars with a market value $4,692,387,416 based on the LBMA Gold Price PM on September 30, 2022 (cost-$4,864,729,757).\nAs at September 30, 2021, the amount of gold owned by GLDM and held by the custodian in its vault was 2,517,632.7 ounces, 100% of which is allocated gold in the form of London Good Delivery gold bars with a market value $4,387,730,778 based on the LBMA Gold Price PM on September 30, 2021 (cost-$4,237,695,934).\nAs at September 30, 2020, the amount of gold owned by GLDM and held by the custodian in its vault was 1,887,680.9 ounces, 100% of which is allocated gold in the form of London Good Delivery gold bars with a market value $3,542,996,473 based on the LBMA Gold Price PM on September 30, 2020 (cost-$3,014,561,176).\nCash Flow from Operations\nGLDM had no net cash flow from operations in the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Cash received in respect of gold sold to pay expenses in the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was the same as those expenses, resulting in a zero cash balance at September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nOff-Balance\nSheet Arrangements\nNeither GLDM nor the Trust is a party to any off-balance\nsheet arrangements.\nCash Resources and Liquidity\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021 GLDM did not have any cash balances. When selling gold to pay expenses, GLDM endeavors to sell the exact amount of gold needed to pay expenses in order to minimize GLDMs holdings of assets other than gold or any gold receivable. As a consequence, we expect that GLDM will not record any net cash flow from its operations and that its cash balance will be zero at the end of each reporting period.\nAnalysis of Movements in the Price of Gold\nAs movements in the price of gold are expected to directly affect the price of the Shares, it is important to understand the recent movements in the price of gold. However, past movements in the price of gold are not indicators of future movements.\nThe following chart shows movements in the price of gold based on the LBMA Gold Price PM in U.S. dollars per ounce over the period from June 26, 2018 (the first date the Shares began trading on the NYSE Arca) to September 30, 2022.\nDaily Gold Price - June 26, 2018 - September 30, 2022\nLBMA Gold Price PM USD\nThe average, high, low and end-of-period\ngold prices for the three and twelve-month periods for the prior three years and for the period from June 26, 2018 (the date the Shares began trading on the NYSE Arca) to September 30, 2022, based on the LBMA Gold Price were:\nPeriod\nAverage\nHigh\nDate\nLow\nDate\nEnd of\nperiod\nLast\nbusiness\nday(1)\nThree months to December 31, 2019\n$ 1,480.96\n$ 1,517.10\nOct 3, 2019\n$ 1,452.05\nNov 12, 2019\n$ 1,523.00\nDec 31, 2019 (2)\nThree months to March 31, 2020\n$ 1,582.80\n$ 1,683.65\nMar 6, 2020\n$ 1,474.25\nMar 19, 2020\n$ 1,608.95\nMar 31, 2020\nThree months to June 30, 2020\n$ 1,711.13\n$ 1,771.60\nJune 29, 2020\n$ 1,576.55\nApr 1, 2020\n$ 1,768.10\nJune 30, 2020\nThree months to September 30, 2020\n$ 1,908.56\n$ 2,067.15\nAug 6, 2020\n$ 1,771.05\nJuly 1, 2020\n$ 1,886.90\nSep 30, 2020\nThree months to December 31, 2020\n$ 1,874.23\n$ 1,940.80\nNov 6, 2020\n$ 1,762.55\nNov 30, 2020\n$ 1,891.10\nDec 31, 2020 (2)\nThree months to March 31, 2021\n$ 1,794.01\n$ 1,943.20\nJan 4, 2021\n$ 1,683.95\nMar 30, 2021\n$ 1,691.05\nMar 31, 2021\nThree months to June 30, 2021\n$ 1,816.48\n$ 1,902.75\nJune 2, 2021\n$ 1,726.05\nApr 1, 2021\n$ 1,763.15\nJune 30, 2021\nThree months to September 30, 2021\n$ 1,789.52\n$ 1,829.30\nJuly 29, 2021\n$ 1,723.35\nAug 10, 2021\n$ 1,742.80\nSep 30, 2021\nThree months to December 31, 2021\n$ 1,795.25\n$ 1,864.90\nNov 17, 2021\n$ 1,753.20\nOct 5, 2021\n$ 1,820.10\nDec 31, 2021 (2)\nThree months to March 31, 2022\n$ 1,877.16\n$ 2,039.05\nMar 8, 2022\n$ 1,788.15\nJan 28, 2022\n$ 1,942.15\nMar 31, 2022\nThree months to June 30, 2022\n$ 1,870.58\n$ 1,976.75\nApr 13, 2022\n$ 1,809.50\nMay 16, 2022\n$ 1,817.00\nJune 30, 2022\nThree months to September 30, 2022\n$ 1,728.91\n$ 1,808.40\nJul 4, 2022\n$ 1,634.30\nSep 27, 2022\n$ 1,671.75\nSep 30, 2022\nTwelve months ended September 30, 2020\n$ 1,672.83\n$ 2,067.15\nAug 6, 2020\n$ 1,452.05\nNov 12, 2019\n$ 1,886.90\nSep 30, 2020\nTwelve months ended September 30, 2021\n$ 1,818.12\n$ 1,943.20\nJan 4, 2021\n$ 1,683.95\nMar 30, 2021\n$ 1,742.80\nSep 30, 2021\nTwelve months ended September 30, 2022\n$ 1,817.08\n$ 2,039.05\nMar 8, 2022\n$ 1,634.30\nSep 27, 2022\n$ 1,671.75\nSep 30, 2022\nJune 26, 2018 to September 30, 2022\n$ 1,630.97\n$ 2,067.15\nAug 6, 2020\n$ 1,178.40\nAug 17, 2018\n$ 1,671.75\nSep 30, 2022\n(1) The end of period gold price is the LBMA Gold Price PM on the last business day of the period.

The LBMA Gold Price AM on the last business day of December 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $1,820.10, $1,891.10 and $1,523.00 respectively. The Net Asset Value of the Trust on December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was calculated using the LBMA Gold Price AM. Item 7A.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nSee Index to Financial Statements on page\nfor a list of the financial statements being filed therein, which are incorporated by reference herein. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nThere have been no changes in accountants and no disagreements with accountants on any matter of accounting principles or practices or financial statement disclosures during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nConclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Trust maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer of the Sponsor, and to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Sponsor, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial and Accounting Officer of the Sponsor, the Sponsor conducted an evaluation of the Trusts disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e).\nBased on this evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial and Accounting Officer of the Sponsor concluded that, as of September 30, 2022, the Trusts disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nChange in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in the Trusts or the Funds internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended September 30, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, these internal controls.\nManagements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Sponsors management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined under Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f)\nand 15d-15(f).\nThe Trusts and the Funds internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Trusts and the Funds assets, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the Trusts and the Funds receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Trusts and the Funds assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become ineffective because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer of the Sponsor assessed the effectiveness of the Trusts and GLDMs internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022. In making this assessment, they used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Their assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Trusts and GLDMs internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over\nfinancial reporting. Based on their assessment and those criteria, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer of the Sponsor concluded that the Trust and GLDM maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022.\nKPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited and reported on the financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2022 included in this Form 10-K,\nas stated in their report which is included herein, issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Trusts and GLDMs internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022.\nNovember 23, 2022\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Trustee of SPDR\u00ae Gold MiniShares\u00ae Trust, the Trustee of World Gold Trust and the Board of Directors of WGC USA Asset Management Company, LLC:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited World Gold Trusts (the Trust) and its series SPDR\u00ae Gold MiniShares\u00ae Trusts (the Fund) internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Trust and the Fund maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the (1) combined statements of financial condition of the Trust, including the combined schedules of investment, as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the related combined statements of operations, cash flows, and changes in net assets for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes, and (2) the statements of financial condition of the Fund, including the schedules of investment, as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations, cash flows, and changes in net assets for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the combined and individual financial statements), and our reports dated November 23, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on those combined and individual financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe management of WGC USA Asset Management Company, LLC (the Trusts and Funds sponsor) is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Trusts and Funds internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Trust and Fund in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nAn entitys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. An entitys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the entity; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the entity are being made only in accordance with\nauthorizations of management and directors of the entity; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the entitys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nNew York, New York\nNovember 23, 2022 Item 9B.

In our opinion, the combined financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Trust as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations, its cash flows, and changes in its net assets for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Trusts internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control\n- Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated November 23, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Trusts internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese combined financial statements are the responsibility of WGC USA Asset Management Company, LLC (the Trusts sponsor). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these combined financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Trust in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the combined financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the combined financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the combined financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the combined financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the combined financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the combined financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the combined financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nEvaluation of the evidence pertaining to the existence of the gold holdings\nAs disclosed in the combined schedule of investment, as of September 30, 2022, the Trusts market value of gold holdings was $4.7 billion, representing approximately 100% of the Trusts total assets. All of the gold holdings, which were 2.8 million ounces as of September 30, 2022, were held by a third-party custodian (the custodian).\nWe identified the evaluation of the evidence pertaining to the existence of the gold holdings as a critical audit matter. Given the nature and volume of the gold holdings, subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the extent and nature of evidence obtained to assess the quantity of gold held by the custodian as of September 30, 2022.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Trusts gold holdings process, including controls over (1) the comparison of the Trusts records of gold held to the custodian records and (2) the approval of gold deposits and withdrawals by the trustee of the Trust. We obtained a schedule directly from the custodian of the Trusts gold holdings held by the custodian as of September 30, 2022. We compared the total ounces on such schedule to the Trusts record of gold holdings. We also attended and observed part of the physical count of the Trusts gold holdings performed at the custodians location by a third party engaged by the Trusts sponsor. We obtained the physical count result of that third party and reconciled it to both the Trusts and the custodians records.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Trusts auditor since 2016.\nNew York, New York\nNovember 23, 2022\nWorld Gold Trust\nCombined Statements of Financial Condition\nat September 30, 2022 and 2021\n(Amounts in 000s of US$)\nSep-30,\nSep-30,\nASSETS\nInvestments in Gold, at fair value (cost $4,864,729 and $4,237,696 at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively)\n$ 4,692,387\n$ 4,387,731\nTotal Assets\n$ 4,692,387\n$ 4,387,731\nLIABILITIES\nAccounts payable to Sponsor\n$\n$\nGold payable\n52,777\n-\nTotal Liabilities\n$ 53,174\n$\nNet Assets\n$ 4,639,213\n$ 4,387,065\nSee notes to the combined financial statements.\nWorld Gold Trust\nCombined Schedules of Investment\n(Amounts in 000s except for percentages)\nSeptember 30, 2022\nOunces of\ngold\nCost\nFair Value\n% of\nNet Assets\nInvestment in Gold\n2,806.9\n$ 4,864,729\n$ 4,692,387\n101.15 %\nTotal Investment\n$ 4,864,729\n$ 4,692,387\n101.15 %\nLiabilities in excess of other assets\n(53,174 )\n(1.15 )%\nNet Assets\n$ 4,639,213\n100.00 %\nSeptember 30, 2021\nOunces of\ngold\nCost\nFair Value\n% of\nNet Assets\nInvestment in Gold\n2,517.6\n$ 4,237,696\n$ 4,387,731\n100.02 %\nTotal Investment\n$ 4,237,696\n$ 4,387,731\n100.02 %\nLiabilities in excess of other assets\n(666 )\n(0.02 )%\nNet Assets\n$ 4,387,065\n100.00 %\nSee notes to the combined financial statements.\nWorld Gold Trust\nCombined Statements of Operations\nFor the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020\n(Amounts in 000s of US$)\nYear Ended\nSep-30, 2022\nYear Ended\nSep-30, 2021\nYear Ended\nSep-30, 2020\nEXPENSES\nSponsor fees\n$ 6,156\n$ 7,462\n$ 3,495\nTotal expenses\n6,156\n7,462\n3,495\nNet investment loss\n(6,156 )\n(7,462 )\n(3,495 )\nNet realized and change in unrealized gain/(loss) on investment in gold\nNet realized gain/(loss) from investment in gold sold to pay Sponsor fees\nNet realized gain/(loss) from gold distributed for the redemption of shares\n32,782\n39,311\n37,008\nNet change in unrealized gain/(loss) on investment in gold\n(322,377 )\n(378,400 )\n409,193\nNet realized and change in unrealized gain/(loss) on investment in gold\n(289,201 )\n(338,455 )\n446,656\nNet income/(loss)\n$ (295,357 )\n$ (345,917 )\n$ 443,161\nSee notes to the combined financial statements.\nWorld Gold Trust\nCombined Statements of Cash Flows\nFor the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020\n(Amounts in 000s of US$)\nYear Ended\nSep-30,\nYear Ended\nSep-30,\nYear Ended\nSep-30,\nINCREASE/DECREASE IN CASH FROM OPERATIONS:\nCash proceeds received from sales of gold\n$ 6,425\n$ 7,313\n$ 3,126\nCash expenses paid\n(6,425 )\n(7,313 )\n(3,126 )\nIncrease/(Decrease) in cash resulting from operations\n-\n-\n-\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of period\n-\n-\n-\nCash and cash equivalents at end of period\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\nSUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE OF NON-CASH FINANCING\nACTIVITIES:\nValue of gold received for creation of share-net\nof change in gold receivable\n$\n1,706,522\n$\n1,602,034\n$\n2,348,580\nValue of gold distributed for redemption of shares-net\nof change in gold payable\n$\n1,106,240\n$\n449,117\n$\n285,146\n(Amounts in 000s of US$)\nYear Ended\nSep-30,\nYear Ended\nSep-30,\nYear Ended\nSep-30,\nRECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME/(LOSS) TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES\nNet Income/(Loss)\n$ (295,357 )\n$ (345,917 )\n$ 443,161\nAdjustments to reconcile net income/(loss) to net cash provided by operating activities:\nProceeds from sales of gold to pay expenses\n6,425\n7,313\n3,126\nNet realized (gain)/loss from investment in gold sold to pay Sponsor fees\n(394 )\n(634 )\n(455 )\nNet realized (gain)/loss from gold distributed for the redemption of shares\n(32,782 )\n(39,311 )\n(37,008 )\nNet change in unrealized gain/(loss) on investment in gold\n322,377\n378,400\n(409,193 )\nIncrease/(Decrease) in accounts payable to Sponsor\n(269 )\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\nSee notes to the combined financial statements.\nWorld Gold Trust\nCombined Statements of Changes in Net Assets\nFor the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020\n(Amounts in 000s of US$)\nYear Ended\nSep-30,\nYear Ended\nSep-30,\nYear Ended\nSep-30,\nNet Assets -

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of GLDM as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations, its cash flows, and changes in its net assets for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), GLDM s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in\nInternal\nControl Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated November 23, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of GLDM s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of WGC USA Asset Management Company, LLC (the Trusts sponsor). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to GLDM in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nEvaluation of the evidence pertaining to the existence of the gold holdings\nAs disclosed in the schedule of investment, as of September 30, 2022, GLDM s market value of gold holdings was $4.7 billion, representing approximately 100% of GLDM s total assets. All of the gold holdings, which were 2.8 million ounces as of September 30, 2022, were held by a third-party custodian (the custodian).\nWe identified the evaluation of the evidence pertaining to the existence of the gold holdings as a critical audit matter. Given the nature and volume of the gold holdings, subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the extent and nature of evidence obtained to assess the quantity of gold held by the custodian as of September 30, 2022.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over GLDM s gold holdings process, including controls over (1) the comparison of GLDM s records of gold held to the custodian records and (2) the approval of gold deposits and withdrawals by the trustee of GLDM. We obtained a schedule directly from the custodian of GLDM s gold holdings held by the custodian as of September 30, 2022. We compared the total ounces on such schedule to GLDM s record of gold holdings. We also attended and observed part of the physical count of GLDM s gold holdings performed at the custodian s location by a third party engaged by GLDM s sponsor. We obtained the physical count result of that third party and reconciled it to both GLDM s and the custodian s records.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as GLDMs auditor since 2016.\nNew York, New York\nNovember 23, 2022\nSPDR\n\u00ae Gold MiniShares\n\u00ae Trust\nStatements of Financial Condition\nat September 30, 2022 and 2021\n(Amounts in 000s of US$except for share and per share data)\nSep-30,\nSep-30,\nASSETS\nInvestments in Gold, at fair value (cost $4,864,729 and $4,237,696 at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively)\n$ 4,692,387\n$ 4,387,731\nTotal Assets\n$ 4,692,387\n$ 4,387,731\nLIABILITIES\nAccounts payable to Sponsor\n$\n$\nGold payable\n52,777\n-\nTotal Liabilities\n$ 53,174\n$\nNet Assets\n$ 4,639,213\n$ 4,387,065\nShares issued and outstanding(1)\n139,750,000\n126,600,000\nNet asset value per Share\n$ 33.20\n$ 34.65\n(1)\nAuthorized share capital is unlimited and the par value of the Shares is $0.00.\nSee notes to the financial statements.\nSPDR\n\u00ae Gold MiniShares\n\u00ae Trust\nSchedules of Investment\n(Amounts in 000s except for percentages)\nSeptember 30, 2022\nOunces\nof gold\nCost\nFair Value\n% of\nNet Assets\nInvestment in Gold\n2,806.9\n$ 4,864,729\n$ 4,692,387\n101.15 %\nTotal Investment\n$ 4,864,729\n$ 4,692,387\n101.15 %\nLiabilities in excess of other assets\n(53,174 )\n(1.15 )%\nNet Assets\n$ 4,639,213\n100.00 %\nSeptember 30, 2021\nOunces\nof gold\nCost\nFair Value\n% of\nNet Assets\nInvestment in Gold\n2,517.6\n$ 4,237,696\n$ 4,387,731\n100.02 %\nTotal Investment\n$ 4,237,696\n$ 4,387,731\n100.02 %\nLiabilities in excess of other assets\n(666 )\n(0.02 )%\nNet Assets\n$ 4,387,065\n100.00 %\nSee notes to the financial statements.\nSPDR\n\u00ae Gold MiniShares\n\u00ae Trust\nStatements of Operations\nFor the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020\n(Amounts in 000s of US$, except per share data)\nYear Ended\nSep-30, 2022\nYear Ended\nSep-30, 2021\nYear Ended\nSep-30, 2020\nEXPENSES\nSponsor fees\n$ 6,156\n$ 7,462\n$ 3,495\nTotal expenses\n6,156\n7,462\n3,495\nNet investment loss\n(6,156 )\n(7,462 )\n(3,495 )\nNet realized and change in unrealized gain/(loss) on investment in gold\nNet realized gain/(loss) from investment in gold sold to pay Sponsor fees\nNet realized gain/(loss) from gold distributed for the redemption of shares\n32,782\n39,311\n37,008\nNet change in unrealized gain/(loss) on investment in gold\n(322,377 )\n(378,400 )\n409,193\nNet realized and change in unrealized gain/(loss) on investment in gold\n(289,201 )\n(338,455 )\n446,656\nNet income/(loss)\n$ (295,357 )\n$ (345,917 )\n$ 443,161\nNet income/(loss) per share\n$ (2.23 )\n$ (3.01 )\n$ 7.83\nWeighted average number of shares (in 000s)\n132,493\n114,791\n56,590\nSee notes to the financial statements.\nSPDR\n\u00ae Gold MiniShares\n\u00ae Trust\nStatements of Cash Flows\nFor the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020\n(Amounts in 000s of US$)\nYear Ended\nSep-30,\nYear Ended\nSep-30,\nYear Ended\nSep-30,\nINCREASE/DECREASE IN CASH FROM OPERATIONS:\nCash proceeds received from sales of gold\n$ 6,425\n$ 7,313\n$ 3,126\nCash expenses paid\n(6,425 )\n(7,313 )\n(3,126 )\nIncrease/(Decrease) in cash resulting from operations\n-\n-\n-\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of period\n-\n-\n-\nCash and cash equivalents at end of period\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\nSUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE OF NON-CASH FINANCING\nACTIVITIES:\nValue of gold received for creation of shares-net\nof change in gold receivable\n$\n1,706,522\n$\n1,602,034\n$\n2,348,580\nValue of gold distributed for redemption of shares-net\nof change in gold payable\n$\n1,106,240\n$\n449,117\n$\n285,146\n(Amounts in 000s of US$)\nYear Ended\nSep-30,\nYear Ended\nSep-30,\nYear Ended\nSep-30,\nRECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME/(LOSS) TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES\nNet income/(loss)\n$ (295,357 )\n$ (345,917 )\n$ 443,161\nAdjustments to reconcile net income/(loss) to net cash provided by operating activities:\nProceeds from sales of gold to pay expenses\n6,425\n7,313\n3,126\nNet realized (gain)/loss from investment in gold sold to pay Sponsor fees\n(394 )\n(634 )\n(455 )\nNet realized (gain)/loss from gold distributed for the redemption of shares\n(32,782 )\n(39,311 )\n(37,008 )\nNet change in unrealized gain/(loss) on investment in gold\n322,377\n378,400\n(409,193 )\nIncrease/(Decrease) in accounts payable to Sponsor\n(269 )\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\nSee notes to the financial statements.\nSPDR\n\u00ae\nGold MiniShares\n\u00ae Trust\nStatements of Changes in Net Assets\nFor the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020\n(Amounts in 000s of US$)\nYear Ended\nSep-30,\nYear Ended\nSep-30,\nYear Ended\nSep-30,\nNet Assets -

Organization\nWorld Gold Trust (the Trust), formerly known as World Currency Gold Trust, was organized as a Delaware statutory trust on August 27, 2014 and is governed by the Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement and Declaration of Trust (Declaration of Trust), dated as of April 16, 2018 and amended on February 6, 2020, between WGC USA Asset Management Company, LLC (the Sponsor) and the Delaware Trust Company (the Trustee). The Trust is authorized to issue an unlimited number of shares of beneficial interest. The beneficial interest in the Trust may be divided into one or more series. The Trust has established six separate series, one of which is operational as of September 30, 2022.\nThe accompanying financial statements relate to the series SPDR\u00ae Gold MiniShares\u00ae Trust (GLDM). The shares of GLDM (the Shares) began publicly trading on June 26, 2018 on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the NYSE Arca). The Shares are also listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange (Bolsa Mexicana de Valores). The fiscal year-end\nof GLDM is September 30th\n.\nThe investment objective of GLDM is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of gold bullion, less its expenses. GLDMs only ordinary recurring expense is the Sponsors annual fee of 0.10% of its net asset value (NAV). The Sponsor believes that, for many investors, the Shares represent a cost-effective investment in gold.\nBNY Mellon Asset Servicing, a division of The Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM or the Administrator), is the administrator and transfer agent. BNYM also serves as the custodian of GLDMs cash, if any. ICBC Standard Bank Plc (the Custodian) is responsible for custody of GLDMs gold bullion. State Street Global Advisors Funds Distributors, LLC (the Marketing Agent) is the Marketing Agent.\nThe Trust had no operations with respect to GLDMs Shares prior to June 26, 2018 other than matters relating to its organization and the registration of the offer and sale of GLDMs Shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\n2. Significant Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires those responsible for preparing financial statements to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by GLDM and the Trust.\n2.1 Basis of Accounting\nFor accounting purposes, GLDM is an investment company within the scope of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 946, Financial Services-Investment Companies, and therefore applies the specialized accounting and reporting guidance therein. It is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.\nThese financial statements present the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Trust combined with its operating series and GLDM separately. For the periods presented, there were no balances or activity for the Trust and the footnotes accordingly relate to GLDM, unless stated otherwise.\n2.2 Basis of Presentation\nThe financial statements are presented for the Trust, as the SEC registrant, combined with GLDM and for GLDM individually. The debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or\nWorld Gold Trust\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n2.2 Basis of Presentation-(continued)\notherwise existing with respect to GLDM are enforceable only against the assets of GLDM and not against the assets of the Trust generally or any other series that the Trust may establish.\n2.3 Cash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments of sufficient credit quality with original maturity of three months or less.\n2.4 Fair Value Measurement\nU.S. GAAP defines fair value as the price a fund would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. GLDMs policy is to value its investments at fair value.\nVarious inputs are used in determining the fair value of GLDMs assets or liabilities. Inputs may be based on independent market data (observable inputs) or they may be internally developed (unobservable inputs). These inputs are categorized into a disclosure hierarchy consisting of three broad levels for financial reporting purposes. The level of a value determined for an asset or liability within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are:\nLevel 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not considered to be active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means; and\nLevel 3 - Inputs that are unobservable for the asset and liability, including a funds assumptions (if any) used in determining the fair value of investments.\nThe following table summarizes GLDMs investment at fair value:\n(Amounts in 000s of US$)\nSeptember 30, 2022\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nInvestment in Gold\n$ 4,692,387\n$ -\n$ -\nTotal\n$ 4,692,387\n$ -\n$ -\n(Amounts in 000s of US$)\nSeptember 30, 2021\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nInvestment in Gold\n$ 4,387,731\n$ -\n$ -\nTotal\n$ 4,387,731\n$ -\n$ -\nThere were no transfers between Level 1 and other Levels for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nThe Administrator values the gold held by GLDM on the basis of the price of an ounce of gold as determined by ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (the IBA), a benchmark administrator, which provides an independently administered auction process, as well as the overall administration and\nWorld Gold Trust\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n2.4 Fair Value Measurement-(continued)\ngovernance for the London Bullion Market Association (the LBMA). In determining the NAV of GLDM, the Administrator values the gold held on the basis of the price of an ounce of gold determined by the IBA 3:00 PM auction process (the LBMA Gold Price PM), which is an electronic auction. The auction runs twice daily at 10:30 AM and 3:00 PM London time. The Administrator calculates the NAV of GLDM on each day the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading, generally as of 12:00 PM New York time. If no LBMA Gold Price PM is made on a particular evaluation day or if the LBMA Gold Price PM has not been announced by 12:00 PM New York time on a particular evaluation day, the next most recent LBMA Gold Price AM or PM is used in the determination of the NAV of GLDM, unless the Administrator, in consultation with the Sponsor, determines that such price is inappropriate to use as the basis for such determination.\n2.5. Custody of Gold\nGold is held by the Custodian on behalf of GLDM, 100% of which is allocated gold in the form of good delivery gold bars. A current list of all gold held by the Custodian, including any held with a subcustodian is available on the sponsors website at www.spdrgoldshares.com.\n2.6. Gold Receivable\nGold receivable represents the quantity of gold covered by contractually binding orders for the creation of Shares where the gold has not yet been transferred to GLDMs account. Generally, ownership of the gold is transferred within two business days of the trade date.\n(Amounts in 000s of US$)\nSep-30,\nSep-30,\nGold receivable\n$ -\n$ -\n2.7. Gold Payable\nGold payable represents the quantity of gold covered by contractually binding orders for the redemption of Shares where the gold has not yet been transferred out of GLDMs account. Generally, ownership of the gold is transferred within two business days of the trade date.\n(Amounts in 000s of US$)\nSep-30,\nSep-30,\nGold payable\n$ 52,777\n$ -\n2.8. Creations and Redemptions of Shares\nGLDM creates and redeems Shares from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Units (a Creation Unit equals a block of 100,000 Shares). GLDM issues Shares in Creation Units to certain authorized participants (Authorized Participants) on an ongoing basis. The creation and redemption of Creation Units is only made in exchange for the amount of gold and any cash represented by the Creation Units being created or redeemed. This amount will be based on the combined net asset value of the number of Shares included in the Creation Units being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem Creation Units is properly received.\nWorld Gold Trust\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n2.8. Creations and Redemptions of Shares-(continued)\nAs the Shares are redeemable in Creation Units at the option of the Authorized Participants, GLDM has classified the Shares as Net Assets for financial reporting purposes. Changes in the Shares for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:\n(Amounts are in 000s)\nYear Ended\nSep-30, 2022\nYear Ended\nSep-30, 2021\nYear Ended\nSep-30, 2020\nActivity in Number of Shares Created and Redeemed:\nCreations\n46,200\n44,400\n68,000\nRedemptions\n(33,050 )\n(12,550 )\n(8,700 )\nNet Change in Number of Shares Created and Redeemed\n13,150\n31,850\n59,300\n(Amounts in 000s of US$)\nYear Ended\nSep-30,\nYear Ended\nSep-30,\nYear Ended\nSep-30,\nActivity in Value of Shares Created and Redeemed:\nCreations\n$ 1,706,522\n$ 1,620,827\n$ 2,352,554\nRedemptions\n(1,159,017 )\n(449,117 )\n(285,146 )\nNet change in Value of Shares Created and Redeemed\n$ 547,505\n$ 1,171,710\n$ 2,067,408\n2.9. Income and Expense (Amounts in 000s of US$)\nThe Administrator will, at the direction of the Sponsor, sell GLDMs gold as necessary to pay its expenses. When selling gold to pay expenses, the Administrator will endeavor to sell the smallest amount of gold needed to pay expenses in order to minimize GLDMs holdings of assets other than gold. Unless otherwise directed by the Sponsor, the Administrator will give a sell order and sell gold to the Custodian at the LBMA Gold Price PM following the sell order. A gain or loss is recognized based on the difference between the selling price and the average cost of the gold sold, and such amounts are reported as net realized gain/(loss) from investment in gold sold to pay Sponsor expenses on the Statement of Operations.\nGLDMs net realized and change in unrealized gain/(loss) on investment in gold for the year ended September 30, 2022 of $(289,201) is made up of a realized gain of $394 from the sale of gold to pay Sponsor fees, a realized gain of $32,782 from gold distributed for the redemption of shares, and a change in unrealized loss of $322,377 on investment in gold.\nGLDMs net realized and change in unrealized gain/(loss) on investment in gold for the year ended September 30, 2021 of $(338,455) is made up of a realized gain of $634 from the sale of gold to pay Sponsor fees, a realized gain of $39,311 from gold distributed for the redemption of shares, and a change in unrealized loss of $378,400 on investment in gold.\n2.10. Income Taxes\nGLDM is classified as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, it is not subject to U.S. federal income tax. Instead, its income and expenses flow through to the shareholders, and the Administrator will report GLDMs proceeds, income, deductions, gains and losses to the Internal Revenue Service on that basis.\nThe Sponsor has evaluated whether there are uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition and has determined that no reserves for uncertain tax positions are required as of\nWorld Gold Trust\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n2.10. Income Taxes-(continued)\nSeptember 30, 2022. As of September 30, 2022, the 2021, 2020 and 2019 tax years remain open for examination. There were no examinations in progress at period end.\n3.

Related Parties - Sponsor\nEffective February 23, 2022, the Sponsor reduced its annual fee of 0.18% of the NAV of GLDM to 0.10% of the NAV of GLDM and implemented a one-for-two\nreverse stock split of the Shares which now represent 1/50th of an ounce of gold. The Sponsors annual fee equal to 0.10% of the NAV of GLDM is calculated daily. The Sponsor is responsible for the payment of all GLDMs ordinary fees and expenses, including but not limited to the following: fees charged by GLDMs Administrator, Custodian, Marketing Agent and Trustee; exchange listing fees; typical maintenance and transaction fees of The Depository Trust Company; SEC registration fees; printing and mailing costs; audit fees and expenses; and legal fees not in excess of $100,000 per annum and expenses and applicable license fees. The Sponsor is not, however, required to pay any extraordinary expenses incurred in the ordinary course of GLDMs business as outlined in the Sponsors agreement with the Trust.\n5. GLDM Expenses\nGLDMs only ordinary recurring operating expense is the Sponsors annual fee of 0.10% of the NAV of GLDM. The Sponsors fee is payable monthly in arrears.\nExpenses payable will reduce the NAV of GLDM.\n6. Concentration of Risk\nGLDMs primary business activities are the investment in gold and the issuance and sale of Shares.\nVarious factors could affect the price of gold including: (i) global gold supply and demand, which is influenced by such factors as forward selling by gold producers, purchases made by gold producers to unwind gold hedge positions, central bank purchases and sales, and production and cost levels in major gold-producing countries such as China, Australia, South Africa and the United States; (ii) investors expectations with respect to the rate of inflation; (iii) currency exchange rates; (iv) interest rates; (v) investment and trading activities of hedge funds and commodity funds; (vi) other economic variables\nWorld Gold Trust\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n6. Concentration of Risk-(continued)\nsuch as income growth, economic output, and monetary policies; and (vii) global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations. In addition, while gold it used to preserve wealth by investors around the world, there is no assurance that gold will maintain its long-term value in terms of purchasing power in the future. In the event that the price of gold declines, the Sponsor expects the value of an investment in the Shares to decline proportionately. Each of these events could have a material effect on GLDMs financial position and results of operations.\n7. Indemnification\nThe Sponsor and each of its shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, affiliates and subsidiaries will be indemnified by the Trust and held harmless against any losses, liabilities or expenses incurred in the performance of its duties under the Declaration of Trust without gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. The Sponsor shall in no event be deemed to have assumed or incurred any liability, duty, or obligation to any shareholder or to the Trustee other than as expressly provided for in the Declaration of Trust.\nThe Trustee and each of its officers, affiliates, directors, employees, and agents will be indemnified by the Trust from and against any losses, claims, taxes, damages, reasonable expenses, and liabilities incurred with respect to the creation, operation or termination of the Trust, the execution, delivery or performance of the Declaration of Trust or the transactions contemplated thereby; provided that the indemnified party acted without willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence. The Sponsor will not be liable to the Trust, the Trustee or any shareholder for any action taken or for refraining from taking any action in good faith, or for errors in judgment or for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale of any gold or other assets held in trust under Declaration of Trust. However, the preceding liability exclusion will not protect the Sponsor against any liability resulting from its own gross negligence, bad faith, or willful misconduct.\n8.
