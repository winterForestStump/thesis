The operating headquarters is located in the UK as Stylar Ltd., trading as Digital Clarity. is on a month-to-month lease as it is evaluating larger quarters post-pandemic. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nThe U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission instituted an Administrative Proceeding, File No. 3-17990, on May 16, 2017 to revoke the Company's registration statement because of delinquent filings. A hearing was held on August 9, 2017 and the Initial Decision to revoke the registration was dated November 16, 2017. The order was subsequently remanded by order of the U.S. Supreme Court in December 2017. The Company responded to the Remand with evidence of mitigating circumstances under a Protective Order and filed all its delinquent filings: a Super 10-K for 2015-2016-2017 on May 31, 2018 and 10-Q's for 2018 1Q, 2Q on June 22, 2018 and 3Q on July 15, 2018, its due date.\nThe Hearing for January 15, 2019 was re-scheduled because of government shutdown. Digital Brand entered a Motion to Dismiss the Proceedings on March 19, 2019 based on being current as of July 2018, and all filings to date have been filed on time for the 2019 fiscal year. The facts were presented at the hearing. The Division did not support the dismissal in a response to which Digital Brand filed two Amendments to the Consolidated 10-K for 2015- 2016-2017 and the 10-K for 2018 on April 23 and 24, 2019 respectively, and Amendments No. 2 on October 1, 2019 to supersede language in Part II, Item 9A. On November 12, 2019, Carol Fox Foelak, Administrative Law Judge, Securities & Exchange Commission ordered an Initial Decision/Dismissal of the Proceeding. The Dismissal would have become effective under Rule 360 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R., Section 201.360, following the Commissions Order of Finality. Unfortunately, on December 3, 2019 The Division of Enforcement Submitted a Petition for Review of Judge Carol Fox Foelaks Initial Decision dismissing the Administrative Proceedings rendered on November 12, 2019. The Company filed a Motion for summary affirmance of the Initial Decision on December 20, 2019. The Motion for Summary Affirmance was not opposed by Enforcement, nevertheless the Petition for Review (PFR) was filed earlier.\nOn January 25, 2021, the Commission denied the Companys Motion for Summary Affirmance of Judge Carol Fox-Foelaks Dismissal of November 12, 2019 and granted the Divisions Petition for Review and set a briefing schedule beginning February 24, 2021. The Commission concluded that briefing in the ordinary course would...assist the Commission. This appeal raises issues as to which we have an interest in articulating our views and important matters of public interest, including the proper application of the standard that governs determination of sanctions in a Section 12(j) proceeding. Both parties have briefed and concluded April, 2021. The Company is disappointed that so much time has been lost and continues to vociferously support the original Dismissal three years ago.\nThe Commission notified the Company on December 9, 2021 that an extension of 90 days to issue a decision has been ordered. A sixth extension was ordered for an additional 90 days to conclude by June 5, 2023.\nOn June 2, 2023, the SEC issued an Order Dismissing Proceedings under Release 4413 advising us that that their pending administrative proceedings against us because of delinquent filings had been dismissed. A final Order of Dismissal closes the matter after previous unnecessary protracted delays.\nShareholders have been significantly damaged by the protracted SEC matter. The delays were further exacerbated by the unnecessary PFR requested by the Division of Enforcement while the Company continued to meet its reporting compliance since 2018 in good faith as committed to the court and contained in its cured SEC filings and thereafter.\nFrom time to time, the Company has become or may become involved in certain lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company intends to vigorously defend its positions. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and an adverse result in those or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm its financial position, or our business and the outcome of these matters cannot be ultimately predicted.

ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA\nAs a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide this information. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCertain statements contained herein are forward-looking statements and should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under the heading \"Forward-Looking Statements\" above. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. This discussion also should be read in conjunction with the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Report.\nThe Company developed a document called the Creds Deck which provides a description to prospective clients of Digital Claritys value proposition http://www.dbmmgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DBMM_Creds_Deck_2023.pdf\nThe fiscal year 2023 has focused on a measured return to normalcy as businesses have faced enormous challenges over the past few years, and DBMM's operating business Digital Clarity, is no exception. However, for context, it is worth reminding investors and shareholders, that Digital Clarity was acquired by DBMM as a cash-flow positive business with a great reputation and industry network, winning industry awards.\nAs stated in the MD&A's for many years since the acquisition of Digital Clarity, the operating business has always been cash flow positive, but the costs of maintaining a public company far exceed the gross profit in the audited financial statements. That was expected, following the digital business model, though many digital companies do not have any operating revenues while they build the business. The business is developed to a 'to be determined level' (TBD), with all capital infusion riveand revenues (if any) remaining in the growth model.\nAs the economy recovers, and the Company's mitigating circumstances have all been positively concluded, there is also an opportunity for their clients, both new and prospective, to gain a competitive advantage in the post-pandemic commercial environment. The transformation of a company guided by Digital Clarity as its digital architect, demands a \"seat at the table\" of decision makers as the subject matter expert in the new digital landscape. Digital Clarity has earned that role. The industry as seen today and in the future is described below:\n2023 REALITIES TEMPER 2024 BUDGETS AND OUTLOOK\nOne year ago, leaders were facing global unrest, supply chain instability, soaring inflation, the long shadow of the pandemic, and a projected economic slowdown. Yet most had overly optimistic expectations heading into budget season, with every function expecting to lock in modest budget increases for 2023.\nMany of last years concerns didnt materialize, and the outlook for the global economy in 2024 appears brighter as supply chain disruptions ease and inflation edges back toward targets. That said, businesses will have to deal with the after-effects of not only the global pandemic but new challenges. The backdrop as we enter 2024, it is clear that B2B leaders have concerns about inflation and higher interest rates, as they plan for 2024.\nThough the general business sentiment is cautious, Digital Clarity has adapted its model to continually seek to focus on areas that will allow the business to thrive as we come out of the challenging economic backdrop.\nDigital Clarity has been pivoting during these challenging headwinds and working to build upon its experience in the B2B space and engaging with prospects in the SaaS and Tech market.\nDiscretionary marketing budgets, sales headcount, and software costs will continue to be scrutinized closely in 2024, though the demand for maximum performance continues, even though inflation abates particularly in the US. This will only accelerate revenue-focused marketing leadership and reduce the money invested in non-hyper-targeted channels.\nExpansion will become the new-new business, making the line between revenue marketing and demand generation very thin. More of an emphasis will be on preserving revenue through retention and expansion efforts over acquiring net new customers, this is an area where Digital Clarity excels.\nThis will also push leaders to critically evaluate the way in which they acquire customers, including increasing their focus on the technology that helps them prioritize the right accounts. B2B companies beware, It may feel like you have fewer in-market accounts than in prior years, so the risk of wasting resources on accounts that wont buy is much higher. To avoid this, double down on the \u201895-5 rule, there will be a shift. to get in front of the 5% of in-market accounts that are ready to buy now. If not, it's inevitable that your competitors will swipe them up first.\nWHY B2B IS THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME\nJust before and during the pandemic, DBMMs operating business, Digital Clarity analyzed market data as found that there was a large market segment that was very badly served by the Digital marketing sector and in particular lacked a level of planning, strategy and general, good advice when it came to sales growth and brand positioning. This was the Business to Business (B2B) sector. In particular, the technology, software and software services sector (SaaS). This pivot was to prove pivotal to Digital Claritys return to a level of normal trading against a continued volatile economic backdrop.\nB2B is undergoing a renaissance as business models, innovation drivers, and buyers evolve dramatically from decades prior. Now some of the most profitable companies across the globe are B2B companies.\nAs perceptions of the U.S. economy decline, concerns over inflation persist. More than half of small business owners continue to cite it as their top concern. However, B2B leaders are hopeful about the future, even in these uncertain times.\nAnd while many in the business community cite serious concerns over economic turmoil and rising global uncertainty, B2B leaders are largely optimistic about the fate of their organizations and the role of marketing in helping them grow.\nThe B2B Marketing Benchmark uncovers the trends and practices fueling this optimism: Marketing budgets on the rise worldwide; Excitement among B2B leaders about emerging technologies like Generative AI;\nGrowth in the adoption of creative and technical skills that will help marketers meet the demands of these emerging technologies and trends.\nDigital Clarity is well poised to enable B2B leaders to thrive in a rapidly changing environment and how to plan for the long term.\nTHE B2B BUYER JOURNEY IS COMPLEX. THIS IS WHY EXPERTS LIKE DIGITAL CLARITY NEED TO BE INVOLVED FROM THE START.\nSavvy communication experts like Digital Clarity produce ideas that shape perceptions and grow markets. There has never been a better time to navigate into the B2B Marketplace as demand for an experienced, safe pair of hands is required. This sector is growing rapidly and the demand for expertise and skill to help businesses in marketing their services and products is sought after. B2B digital ad spending is projected to reach $18.47 billion by 2024, it will account for nearly 50% of total B2B ad spending that year according to Insider Intelligence.\nFor a long time, tried and tested B2B marketing strategies have been based around a linear model, where activities aim to gather prospects at one end of a pipeline (or funnel) and gently nudge and nurture until they leave as newly won customers at the other end.\nIts been this way for quite a while. Its given rise to language that any B2B marketer is familiar with such as MQLs (marketing qualified leads) and SQLs (sales qualified leads), its shaped how B2B marketing and sales should work together (where one hands the baton on to the other in the form of a well nurtured, warm lead) and KPIs that evaluate this linear performance (pipeline velocity, #MQLs and #SQLs, to name just three).\nSo established is the thinking that the worlds biggest CRM platforms are structured around this linear model of how B2B buying takes place.\nDEVELOPING A STRONGER US FOOTPRINT FOR DIGITAL CLARITY IN 2024-2035\nThe IMF last week became the latest economics organization to declare that the US economy would power ahead, forecasting an expansion of 1.5 percent next year. This compares with IMF forecasts of 1.2 percent for the eurozone and 0.6 percent for the UK.\nA critical structural factor behind the US-European divergence is the difference in the industrial composition of the two economies.\n2023 saw Digital Clarity have a stronger demand by prospective customers in the burgeoning B2B Tech sector and with this laser focus in the tech marketing market, Digital Clarity is well positioned to take advantage of applying its successful methodology ito the largest economy in the world.\nThe US has a booming tech sector, with successful and innovative companies such as Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft that have no European equivalents in Europe. With the US dominating artificial intelligence, that gap is likely to widen, economists warn.\nBy contrast, Europe specializes in industries that are increasingly facing the threat of Chinese competition, such as electric vehicles.\nWith stronger investment and better demographics, the gap between the US and Europe is likely to widen further in the coming years.\nDEMAND FOR MARKETING CONSULTING IN NORTH AMERICA IS PREDICTED TO GROW BY 36%\nThe marketing consulting services segment is forecast to increase by USD 41.56 billion between now and 2027 with North America estimated to contribute 36% to the growth. Data from research company Technavios analysts have elaborately explained the regional trends, drivers, and challenges that are expected to shape the market during the forecast period. With the development of new research companies and the availability of various databases and business analytics tools, this North American region is a major contributor to the global marketing consulting market. This allows businesses to collect meaningful, useful data at a fraction of the cost that marketing consultants pay.\nAdditionally, the ease of scaling virtualization and automating administrative tasks dynamically will increase SaaS adoption. Due to digitalization, various businesses and organizations in this region are adopting SaaS solutions, which help improve a range of operations such as business planning, order fulfilment, and customer service. Hence, such factors are expected to drive market growth in this region during the forecast period.\nB2B BRAND INVESTMENT IS THE BIG FOCUS FOR 2024 AND BEYOND\nTHE SHIFT TO DIGITAL IS PERMANENT\nDespite slower growth, digital will continue to command a greater overall share as more B2B marketers make the permanent shift from traditional advertising to online activities.\nOne of the most pronounced effects the pandemic had on B2B marketing was exponentially accelerating its transition into digital. As the business world begins recovering from the pandemic and returning to more traditional models, this transition has slowed down. The past year has affirmed, however, that it will not stop.\nBy 2025, Gartner expects 80% of B2B sales interactions between suppliers and buyers to occur in digital channels.\nB2B buying behaviors have been shifting toward a buyer-centric digital model, a change that has been accelerated the past couple of years.\nDigital Clarity sit at the intersection of marketing, analysis and sale growth for B2B Tech companies. Focus on digital-lead generation and qualification. The pandemic lockdown underscored how important it is to source and qualify new leads beyond the relationships you already have. It also accelerated digital-lead generation toward high-value customer segments. Traditional lead generation tactics like cold calling are being replaced or supplemented by lower-touch digital leads focused on meeting customers where they are. Sales should work closely with Marketing to source leads from typical digital sources (such as Google and LinkedIn), as well as from relevant third-party affiliates (such as LendingTree for mortgages, Trivago for travel, and Buyerzone for B2B services) that are becoming initial destinations for shoppers. Leaders in digital-lead generation can cost-effectively source and qualify leads as well as automate the lead-generation process to support their sales teams with higher propensity leads.\nThis can energize a sales force. For example, a private-equity owned B2B company was recently challenged with high turnover of entry-level salespeople who lost energy after months of cold calling. Focusing on a digital lead-generation strategy helped them to source more qualified leads with a higher propensity to purchase. This was a huge boost for newer salespeople and helped to supplement their other lead-generation activities, positioning them for greater sales success and reduced salesperson churn.\nSALES ARE GOING DIGITAL\nGartner Says 80% of B2B Sales Interactions Between Suppliers and Buyers Will Occur in Digital Channels by 2025.\nOver the next five years, an even greater rise in digital interactions between buyers and suppliers will break traditional sales models.\nThe Gartner Future of Sales 2025 report predicts that by 2025, 80% of B2B sales interactions between suppliers and buyers will occur in digital channels. Chief sales officers (CSOs) and other senior sales leaders must accept that buying preferences have permanently changed and, as a result, so too will the role of sellers.\nSales organizations must be able to sell to customers everywhere the customer expects to engage, interact and transact with suppliers. Gartner defines the future of sales as the permanent transformation of organizations sales strategies, processes and allocation of resources, moving from a seller-centric to a buyer-centric orientation and shifting from analogy sales processes to digital-first engagement with customers.\nDisruptive buyer dynamics are rewriting the rulebook for B2B sales, demanding digital-first engagement with customers. The rise in digital sales will be driven by marketing that creates demand and trust in brands.\nThis doesnt portend the eventual death of the sales rep, but it does signal drastic changes needed in the seller role. Sales leaders must deliver significant value through digital and omnichannel sales models, aided by sales professionals who can steer self-learning customers toward more confident decisions. Digital delivers this.\nTHE GROWTH OF THE DIGITAL OMNICHANNEL\nGartner research shows a steady shift of customer preferences from in-person sales interactions to digital channels. B2B buyers spend only 17% of the total purchase journey with sales reps.\nBecause the average deal involves multiple suppliers, a sales rep gets roughly 5% of a customers total purchase time. And 44% of millennials prefer no sales rep interaction at all in a B2B setting.\nSales leaders must deliver significant value through digital and omnichannel sales models, aided by sales professionals who can steer self-learning customers toward more confident decisions.\nTHE OMNICHANNELREMAINS KEY IN B2B BUYING\nDigital Clarity can help organizations adopt the B2B Omnichannel. Eight in ten B2B leaders say that omnichannel is as or more effective than traditional methods, a sentiment that has grown sharply in the last 2 years. Even as in-person engagement re-emerged as an option, buyers made clear they prefer a cross-channel mix, choosing in-person, remote, and digital self-serve interactions in equal measure.\nB2B e-commerce has taken the lead as the most effective sales channel. It is rated first by 35 percent of respondents, ahead of in-person sales (26 percent), video conference (12 percent), email (10 percent), and telephone (8 percent) according to a recent report from McKinsey. Companies winning market share have not only digital self-serve channels such as their own websites but also broader e-commerce offerings. For example, 48 percent of winners are on industry-specific marketplaces, compared with only 13 percent of companies losing share.\nDigital Clarity helps companies deploy hybrid marketing models, both online and online, that then feed into sales teams. Hybrid sales models, which are comprised of roles with a mix of both in-person and remote time with customers, are deployed by 57 percent of market-leading companies.\nCustomers are increasingly willing to spend big on e-commerce transactions. Many B2B companies shun e-commerce over concern about channel conflict: 38 percent of respondents said it was the biggest reason they avoided selling online. However, the sales growth opportunity may now outweigh related potential costs. Similar to last year, about 70 percent of decision-makers are prepared to spend up to $500,000 on a single e-commerce transaction. At the highest end of the spectrum, however, we see meaningful movement: the number of decision-makers willing to spend as much as $10 million or more has increased by 83 percent. This trend holds true particularly in China, India, and the United States, and in global energy and materials (GEM); telecommunications, media, and technology (TMT); and advanced industries sectors.\nMcKinsey says that the equilibrium is no accident. As B2B buyers flexed to remote and digital ways of engaging, they found much to like. The use and preference for e-commerce-self-serve, for example-has continually grown year on year.\nOmnichannel is more effective than traditional sales models alone. As more companies enable face-to-face, remote, and e-commerce interactions, satisfaction with the sales model has grown exponentially. More than 90 percent of B2B companies say their go-to-market model is just as or more effective than before the pandemic began.\nTaking an omnichannel approach means strategy and ROI are built in from the start too, so as an approach, it helps measure what works - allowing accurate attribution of results and enabling marketers to move the budget from what doesnt work to doing more of what does. According to the recent DMA Response Rate Report, 65% of marketers use two or more media channels in their marketing campaigns while 44% of marketers use three or more.\nThere might be data, software, automation, and analytics considerations but B2B marketing is chiefly about ROI and about creating a large top-of funnel that can be nurtured through to sales conversion. Omni-channel is also inherent in the design. Campaigns that are planned for all relevant channels are not bolted into them as an afterthought.\nDIGITAL CLARITY PERFECTLY POSITIONED FOR GROWTH\nOrganizations will have to fight hard to retain loyalty if customer needs are not met: for example, eight in ten B2B decision makers say they will actively look for a new supplier if performance guarantees.\nBuyers are more willing than ever before to spend big through remote or online sales channels, with 35 percent willing to spend $500,000 or more in a single transaction. Seventy-seven percent of B2B customers are also willing to spend $50,000 or more.\nB2B customers now regularly use ten or more channels to interact with suppliers.\nDigital Clarity is a specialist in many of these channels and has been for a number of years. This expertise, experience, and trust will put Digital Clarity front of mind for organizations as they seek professional advice.\nTHE B2B MILLENIAL BUYER IS CHANGING THE LANDSCAPE\nMillennials and Gen Z, or those born between 1996 and 2012, constitute 64% of business buyers.\nYounger buyers are more demanding, engaging in more buying activities, and more willing to express their dissatisfaction with the buying process.\nNearly half of millennial buyers prefer no engagement with a salesperson at all, with the average being a third. In 2025, digital channels will account for four-fifths of all B2B sales engagements. Ultimately, the breakdown of the traditional sales model is driven by the digital shift in industrial buying, dramatically speeded up by the social distancing of vendors and clients.\nThis is where Digital Clarity comes in. Part of the consulting strategy is to help B2B product sales by reshaping marketing strategies to focus on the millennial B2B e-commerce sector. Between 2024 - 2026, over $2 trillion in B2B product sales will be taking place over ecommerce websites. However, this will still represent only a small portion of overall US B2B product sales and just over a fifth of B2B electronic sales.\nMillennial refers to people born between 1981 and 1996. Gen Z refers to those born between 1996 and 2012. According to a recent report from Forrester Research Inc. Millennial and Gen Z B2B buyers are now the chief purchasers of goods and services for their organization. And when it comes to ecommerce, the growing number of millennial and Gen Z professionals have very high expectations for B2B ecommerce,\nMillennial and Gen Z B2B buyers also have high standards for engaging and purchasing online from sellers. Younger buyers carry new demands and expectations for B2B buying. Forrester predicts that in two years, more than a third of millennial and Gen Z business buyers will purchase through self-guided digital channels. Those include vendor websites, marketplaces, app stores, or directly from an existing product.\nFurthermore, Millennials and Gen Z B2B buyers are active information seekers. Younger buyers go to more sources and find third-party resources more impactful than vendor resources. This group is quicker to express dissatisfaction with the buying experience. 90% of younger buyers cite dissatisfaction with their vendor in at least one area compared to 71% of older buyers.\nCONTENT MARKETING\nContent has become a critical tool in the marketing mix for almost every B2B brand. Nine out of ten B2B marketers are using content marketing strategies to pull in new customers. This year, the most successful marketers were already spending 40% or more of their budget on their content strategy.\nAt its simplest, B2B content marketing is when a brand uses stories, ideas, and insights to engage and influence a business audience.\nThere is a realization amongst B2B brands that rather than being faceless organizations, they need to tell their brands story and show a more human side to their business, endear and promote demand from other businesses and customers. The best content marketing campaigns back up these stories and ideas with robust insights: interesting data points, original research, and real-world examples that help their customers understand a new trend or challenge and equip them with the tools and best practices to respond and thrive.\nThese data points and research is utilized by Digital Clarity to support companies in shaping their content strategy.

Digital transformation is considered as the utilization of digital technology. Digitally transformed enterprises can be flexible to the changing technological landscape and can address abrupt shifts in the industry, particularly the one presently created by the COVID-19 pandemic; studies show that the efficiency and rate of adaptation of digitally transformed companies to a post-pandemic era are relatively larger than conventional businesses. Source\nDigital Clarity can help various businesses that have been considerably affected by the global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the significant challenges for the global economy in 2020 was to facilitate business continuity in the midst of social distancing guidelines, lockdown norms, work-from-home culture, and other operational challenges. The lack of availability of digital strategies, infrastructure, or tools worsens the challenges for various companies that were needed to abruptly shift operations online or allow workers to work from their homes.\nThe situation, on the other hand, resulted in a considerable surge in awareness regarding the urgent requirement for digital transformation across a majority of the industries and created some lucrative opportunities for the global market. Companies are getting more aware of the advantages of digital transformation, particularly in the work-from-home culture that needs a business to allow the employees to easily learn, collaborate and perform organizational functions across remote locations.\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF STRATEGIC MARKETING CONSULTANCY\nThe fundamentals of marketing may not have changed, but everything else has: goals, roles, expectations, talent needs, and more.

Although not formally classed as \u2018agile, the twists and turns of the pandemic have required executives to innovate on the fly and collaborate to get things done. This has been compounded by working from home, which has cut out distractions and created more time for \u2018deep thinking. Regardless of headcount, a return to more stable trading conditions shouldnt mean running back to the standard practices and silos that previously slowed marketers down.\nAdobe says that Business-to-business (B2B) commerce will continue to undergo a major transformation as companies adopt the latest technologies to find new customers, improve their supply-chain efficiencies, and provide a more personalized user experience to their clientele.\nDigital Clarity has created a unique Diagnosis Workshop that helps brands identify needs as well as assess the opportunities available.

The increasing use of smartphones and the availability of cheap internet services are the two major factors propelling the growth prospects for this market. More than 30% of the companies are planning to spend around 75% of their advertising expenditures on digital marketing within the next five years.\nU. S. Marketers are expected to spend $110.1 billion on digital ads this year, or 51% of the $214.6 billion total U.S. advertising spending forecast, excluding political ads. Newspapers, radio, magazines, and local television now account for just 21% of the U.S. ad market. From The Wall Street Journal\nTHE GROWTH OF B2B SOCIAL MEDIA\n2020 will go down as the year that marketing was pulled into the boardroom. 80% of senior executives said the role of marketing in setting strategy has expanded since the pandemic. Traditional consumers have moved online, making the digital environment even more important right now.\nThis priority has raised the profile of marketing as companies scramble to understand the digital-first consumer. The battleground for 2023 will be about speed and agility. Now that many companies have treasure troves of data, the difference is how fast they can personalize the experience and respond to consumer behaviors. Expect to see more investment and innovation in technology infrastructure alongside marketing.\n\u25cf\n76% of B2B organizations use social media analytics to measure content performance.\n\u25cf\nBy 2025, 80% of B2B sales interactions will occur on digital channels.\n\u25cf\nU.S. B2B business will spend $2 billion in 2022, and $2.33 billion in 2023 approximately 2-5% - 4% growth in 2024\nGROWTH IN LINKEDIN ADVERTISING SET TO SOAR BEYOND 2023\nAlmost all B2B content marketers (96%) use LinkedIn.

This migration has upset the power balance, with customers now more in control of the relationship and less loyal to brands and products. On top of that, 60% of companies have seen new buying behaviors such as changes to average basket size and product interests.\nPandemic disruption caused many businesses to demand a similar level of convenience to consumers. After returning to normal, theres no question that the new normal is digital.\nGROWTH IN INVESTOR AWARENESS AND OUTREACH.\nWe expect that, in 2024, the strategic outreach will be directed at investors around the world who understand the digital marketplace and its expanding influence on consumer decisions. DBMM will target new investors through a global digital and traditional integrated investor outreach campaign which will be run by Digital Clarity, with third parties, as required, for distribution. In all areas, the Company will act in the interests of all stakeholders.\nIn the full industry context of dramatic expansion of digital footprints, there has been no direct correlation between DBMM's revenues and its share price. Economic and industry analysts have opined that the industry multiple continues to grow to, in some cases, 25-30 times revenues. DBMM will expand its client and geographic scale, thus increasing revenues. There were matters outside of DBMM's control which caused growth to be in neutral, and in 2020/21 the pandemic threw all planning into disarray. With capital infusion following the closure of the SEC review with a final order in June 2023 of the earlier dismissal, 2024 will follow the model of a growing client base and geographic reach until it achieves a TBD level of profitability. We anticipate the benchmark will replicate successful industry models in digital technology, marketing and company transformation.\nOn October 26, 2022, FINRA processed a Form 211 relating to the initiation of priced quotations of our shares of common stock, which means that the submitting broker-dealer has demonstrated to FINRA compliance with FINRA Rule 6432 and therefore has met the requirements under that rule to initiate a quotation for our shares of common stock within four days of October 26, 2022. FINRAs processing of a Form 211 in no way constitutes FINRAs approval of the security, the issuer, or the issuers business and relates solely to the submitting broker-dealers obligation to comply with FINRA Rule 6432 and SEA Rule 15c2-11 when quoting a security. (FINRA TO Glendale Securities)\nAfter OTC Markets review of our activities following their process, our shares of common stock returned to normal market trading without restriction or caveat emptor. The caveat emptor was removed on December 20, 2022. Accordingly, plans to grow investor awareness and outreach are underway.\nGlendale Securities, Inc. is the designated Market Maker.\nThe SEC matter remained open even after the November 12, 2019 ALJ Dismissal regarding the cured late filings, which should have closed the matter then. This has been damaging to our investors and us and impedes our progress. Nevertheless, our compliance continued with required timely filings. In June 2023, the SEC issued an Order Dismissing Proceedings as Release 4413 advising us that their administrative proceedings against us has been dismissed, and a Final Order issued.\nFINANCIAL OVERVIEW/OUTLOOK\nDBMM has been honing its commercial model since the acquisition of Digital Clarity (DC) in 2011, and has been cash flow-positive as an operating company since then. Unfortunately, external events outside of DBMMs control have precluded the growth expected to this point; however, its margins of 35-50% are accurate. Aspirationally, when the Company reaches appropriate scale and profitability TBD, the business will meet all stakeholder expectations.\nThe growth trajectory anticipated during 2023 remained deferred until the Company returned to normal business and normal trading. However, the timeframe was only the last quarter of the 2023 fiscal year. Normal trading has resumed; however, the management has used the analogy of, Its like turning around a yacht. Nevertheless, clients will benefit due to a wider range of resources, and the shareholders will benefit as the market cap grows. The media market multiple far exceeds the old manufacturing multiples, as digital technology and marketing has become one of fastest growing industries in the world today. The trading in our shares of common stock returned to normal on December 20, 2022 with no restrictions. The US retail marketplace of our shares of common stock was open finally to all investors. We began the process of restarting the growth infrastructure in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 following the Final Order of Dismissal issued on June 2, 2023.\nThe return to normal business is a step-by-step process now that the SEC matter is closed in our favor and all mitigating factors circumstances concluded to our benefit. DBMMs place in the industry reputationally is strong, particularly for its size. The industry environment continues to grow exponentially, and digital marketing and company transformation is an essential strategy for any commercial activity, and thus has become embedded in planning.\nNevertheless, since 2020, revenues have slowed down temporarily due to a number of factors: 1) client uncertainty caused by Brexit trade issues, 2) COVID-19 global slowdown with some clients pausing as lockdowns stopped and started, 3) clients needing to extend or double down lacked the resources, and 4) DBMM addressing its mitigating circumstances brought about by the SEC Matter, all of which were external events through no fault of the Company, DBMM. To address the changing environment, the business development model has evolved and, as such, Digital Clarity has earned a seat at the table, client by client. With precision, the revenues are turning around.\nRevenues have been increasing quarter to quarter following the pandemic slowdown.\nSeveral years ago, the Company received a commitment for future working capital to grow the Company in key markets. Growth capital will be directed to support a client base rebalancing and leveraging of a very dynamic, transformational, digital landscape. DCs mantra remains the same: ROI is our DNA. Going forward, there will be an emphasis on investor awareness now that normal business recommenced. DBMM intends to make significant strides in aggressively broadening its brand exposure. There are investors around the globe who understand the digital marketplace and its increasing influence on commercial decisions. DBMM will be targeting new shareholders in the public market through a global digital and traditional, integrated campaign run by DC, with third parties, as required for distribution.\nThe expectations for fiscal year 2023 were to return to normal trading first, which now has occurred, and then move ahead to a scaled growth plan in multiple geographies once normal business recommenced and the SEC matter is finally closed. The result will benefit all stakeholders. This process is step-by-step in order to assure all growth is sustainable and continuing.\nRegarding capital infusion, the Company resolved in 2015 to eliminate any consideration of using convertible debentures as a financing vehicle. Accordingly, the Company has not issued convertible debentures since 2015 nor have any convertible debentures been executed since 2016.\nAdditionally, we have demonstrated our adherence to such a philosophy by renegotiating its aged debt with lenders, one at a time, at fixed settlement amounts with no conversion terms. Furthermore, such renegotiations lead to the derecognition of derivative liabilities overhanging our balance sheet. The Company intends to continue its debt negotiation and modification program.\nThis has been a successful strategy thus far:\nDuring fiscal year 2021 and so far in 2023, and to a lesser extent in fiscal 2020, we successfully reached agreements with certain lenders resulting in a gain on extinguishment for loans payable which amounted to the difference between the carrying value and the revised amount of the obligations.\nThe gain on extinguishment of principal and accrued interest amounted to $169,837 and $57,802 during fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nWe also successfully reached an agreement with a holder of convertible debentures aggregating $249,800 to modify its terms. Such debentures are no longer convertible, are now non-interest bearing, and have been reclassified to loans payable. It also resulted in a decrease in derivative liabilities and an increase in additional paid-in capital of approximately $260,000 during fiscal 2021.\nFurthermore, in March 2022, we reached an agreement with a holder of convertible debentures to satisfy obligations aggregating $85,000 in consideration of 30 million shares of the Companys common stock.\nIn February 2023, we reached an agreement with a holder of convertible debentures to satisfy obligations aggregating $76,000 in consideration of 7.5 million shares of the Companys common stock.\nIn May 2023, we reduced our liability to a lessor by $15,000.\nFiscal Year 2023\nWe had $45,000 in cash and our working capital deficiency amounted to approximately $6.5 million at August 31, 2023.\nDuring fiscal 2023, we used cash in our operating activities amounting to $437,000. Our cash used in operating activities was comprised of our net loss of $713,000 adjusted primarily for the following:\nChange in fair value of derivative liability of $42,070 and loss on extinguishment of debt of $73,000.\nAdditionally, the following variations in operating assets and liabilities during fiscal 2023 impacted our cash used in operating activity: - to\nIncrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses, accrued interest, and accrued compensation, of $245,000, resulting from a short fall in liquidity and capital resources.\nWe generated cash from financing activities of $471,000 which primarily consists of the proceeds from the issuance of loans payable.\nFiscal Year 2022\nWe had approximately $10,000 in cash and our working capital deficiency amounted to approximately $5.9 million at August 31, 2022.\nDuring fiscal 2022, we used cash in our operating activities amounting to approximately $389,000. Our cash used in operating activities was comprised of our net loss of approximately $626,000 adjusted primarily for the following:\nChange in fair value of derivative liability of $201,000 and loss on extinguishment of debt of $83,000.\nAccounts payable, accrued expenses, accrued interest, and accrued compensation, of approximately $363,000, resulting from a short fall in liquidity and capital resources.\nDuring fiscal 2022, we generated cash from financing activities of approximately $389,000 which primarily consists of the proceeds from demand notes payable of approximately $399,000.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result if The Company is unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company has outstanding loans and convertible notes payable aggregating $3.0 million at August 31, 2023 and doesnt have sufficient cash on hand to satisfy such obligations. The preceding raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. However, the Company generated proceeds of approximately $471,000 from financing activities during fiscal 2023. The Company also has a non-binding Commitment Letter from an investor of $250,000 which also includes a right of first refusal on additional capital raise up to $3 million which will contribute to satisfying such obligations and fund any potential cash flow deficiencies from operations for the foreseeable future.\nAccordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement values. The financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nComparison of Results for fiscal 2023 and 2022\nFor the Years Ended\nIncrease/\nIncrease/\n(Decrease)\n(-)Decrease\nAugust 31, 2023\nAugust 31, 2022\n$\n%\nSALES\n$ 309,644\n$ 225,842\n$ 83,802\n%\nCOST OF SALES\n260,774\n131,272\n129,502\n%\nGROSS PROFIT\n48,870\n94,570\n(45,700\n)\n%\nCOSTS AND EXPENSES\nSales, general and administrative\n463,694\n553,042\n(89,348\n)\n%\nTOTAL OPERATING (GAIN) EXPENSES\n463,694\n553,042\n(89,348\n)\n%\nOPERATING GAIN (LOSS)\n(414,824\n)\n(458,472\n)\n(43,648\n)\n%\nOTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE\nInterest expense\n313,235\n384,615\n(71,380\n)\n%\nOther income\n(46,255\n)\n(98,265\n)\n52,010\nNM\nLoss (gain) on extinguishment of debt\n73,349\n82,845\n(9,496\n)\nNM\nChange in fair value of derivative liability\n(42,070\n)\n(201,239\n)\n159,169\nNM\nTOTAL OTHER EXPENSE\n298,259\n167,956\n130,303\nNM\nNET LOSS\n$ (713,083\n)\n$ (626,428\n)\n$ 86,655\n%\nNM: not meaningful\nWe currently generate revenue through our Pay-Per-Click Advertising, Search Engine Marketing, Search Engine Optimization Services, Web Design, Social Media, Digital analytics and Advisory Services.\nOur primary sources of revenue are Advisory Services (including Web design) and Per-Click Advertising which amounted to 63% and 25% of our revenues, respectively, during fiscal 2023 and 54% and 38%, respectively, during fiscal 2022.\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those services. The Company enter into contracts that can include various combinations of services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\nGeopolitical conflicts and uncertainties as well as risks of recession, high inflation alongside energy costs, and interest rate rises and means global conditions remain challenging going into 2024.\nOur revenues increased during fiscal 2023 when compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of increased advisory services revenues.\nCost of sales during fiscal 2023 increased when compared to the prior year, primarily from additional expenses to meet increased demand.\nThe general and administrative costs during fiscal 2023, when compared to the prior year, decreased primarily from reduced overhead.\nThe decrease in interest expense, which includes interest accrued on certain notes and loans, is primarily due to lesser inducements offered to noteholders in fiscal 2023.\nAdditionally, the Companys loss or gain on extinguishment of debt is a function of the terms at which we can settle our obligations and the fair value of the stock price at the measurement date.\nThe decrease in change of fair value of derivative liability during fiscal 2023 when compared to the prior year is primarily a function of lower volatility during fiscal 2023, which is one of the primary assumptions in computing the fair value of such liability.\nThe other income reflects the recognition of tax credits related to expenses incurred in the UK.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nManagement considers earnings (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, as adjusted, an important indicator in evaluating our business on a consistent basis across various periods. Due to the significance of non-recurring items, EBITDA, as adjusted, enables our management to monitor and evaluate our business on a consistent basis. We use EBITDA, as adjusted, as a primary measure, among others, to analyze and evaluate financial and strategic planning decisions regarding future operating investments and potential acquisitions. We believe that EBITDA, as adjusted, eliminates items that are not part of our core operations, such as interest expense, or items that do not involve a cash outlay, such as loss on extinguishment of debt and change in fair value of derivative liability. EBITDA, as adjusted, should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, pre-tax income (loss), net income (loss) and cash flows used in operating activities. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes significant expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded in our financial statements and is subject to inherent limitations. Investors should review the reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the comparable GAAP financial measure included below. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nFiscal\nNet loss\n$ (713,083\n)\n$ (626,428\n)\nInterest\n313,235\n384,615\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n73,349\n82,845\nChange in fair value of derivative liability\n(42,070 )\n(201,239 )\nEBITDA, as adjusted\n$ (368,569\n)\n$ (360,207\n) ITEM 7A.

(the Company) as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended August 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 31, 2022 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended August 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered net losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans regarding those matters are discussed in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and the significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAs discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements, the company has a derivative liability due to a tainted equity environment.\nTo evaluate the appropriateness of the fair value determined by management, we examined and evaluated the inputs management used in calculating the fair value of the stock-based compensation. To evaluate the appropriateness of the estimates used by the derivative specialist, we examined and evaluated the inputs the specialist used in calculating the value of the derivatives.\n/s/ M&K CPAS, PLLC\nM&K CPAS, PLLC\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2020\nHouston, TX\nNovember 29, 2023\nDIGITAL BRAND MEDIA & MARKETING GROUP, INC.

(The Company) is an OTC:PK listed company. The Company was organized under the laws of the State of Florida on September 29, 1998.\nThe Company strategically focuses on developing the business of its wholly owned and revenue generating online marketing services company, Digital Clarity. With deep DNA in its operating market, blending the services of an experienced professional workforce leveraging a technology offering positions the Company in a strong, forward looking structure. Digital Clarity operates in the growing area of digital marketing that helps companies make the most of the digital economy focusing on areas such as Search Engine Marketing (Google, Yahoo! & Bing), Social Media (Twitter, Facebook & LinkedIn) and Internet Strategy Planning including Design, Analytics and Mobile Marketing.\nFollowing the acquisition of Digital Clarity in 2011 the Company has been honing its business model to be the differentiating service provider in digital marketing space to its clients and prospective business as DBMM grows into one of the leaders in the industry going forward.\nToday, DBMM Group crafts, designs and executes digital marketing strategies across multiple ad platforms and social media networks for a broad array of clients to help each of them establish a uniform brand identity across the digital universe. The product offering is a unique value proposition of intelligent analytics provided by an experienced digital marketing and technology team. Therefore, DBMM Group is a blend of data, strategy and creative execution.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company has outstanding loans and convertible notes payable aggregating $3.0 million at August 31, 2023 and doesnt have sufficient cash on hand to satisfy such obligations. The preceding raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. However, the Company generated proceeds of approximately $471,000 from financing activities during fiscal 2023. The Company also has a non-binding Commitment Letter from an investor of $250,000 which also includes a right of first refusal on additional capital raise up to $3 million which will contribute to satisfying such obligations and fund any potential cash flow deficiencies from operations for the foreseeable future.\nAccordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement values. The financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nNOTE 2 - CORRECTION OF AN ERROR\nThe Company had recognized $49,500 of accrued expenses as a general reserve for legal fees with no identifiable law firm or vendors in fiscal 2011. No law firms or similar vendors have made a claim regarding this accrual or other legal expenses since fiscal 2011, and accordingly, the Company believes that this accrued expense was recorded in error. The error resulted in an overstatement of accounts payable and accrued expenses as of August 31, 2022 and accumulated deficit as of August 31, 2021. This error did not impact the Companys consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income and consolidated statement of cash flows. The accounts payable and accrued expenses and accumulated deficit in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of changes in stockholders deficit have been restated as of August 31, 2022 and August 31, 2021, respectively, to reflect the correction of the error.\nNOTE 3 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary Stylar Ltd (DBA Digital Clarity). All significant inter-company transactions are eliminated.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash in banks. The Company considers cash equivalents to include all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company had no cash equivalents as of August 31, 2023 or 2022.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Accounts receivable are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts.\nThe Company has a policy of reserving for uncollectible accounts based on its best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in its existing accounts receivable. The Company periodically reviews its accounts receivable to determine whether an allowance is necessary based on an analysis of past due accounts and other factors that may indicate that the realization of an account may be in doubt. Account balances deemed to be uncollectible are charged to the bad debt expense after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. At August 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized $0 as the allowance for doubtful accounts.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets (primarily three to five years).\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expect to receive in exchange for those services. The Company enter into contracts that can include various combinations of services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\nNature of Services\nThe Company generally provides its services to companies with international exposure, primarily located in Europe but with international exposure. The Company generally provides its services ratably over the terms of the contract and bills such services at a monthly fixed rate. Some of the services are billed quarterly. The Companys services are sold without guarantees.\nSignificant Judgments\nOur contracts with customers sometimes often include promises to provide multiple services to a customer. Determining whether services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment.\nJudgment is required to determine Standalone Selling Price (SSP) for each distinct performance obligation. The Company uses a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including set-up services, monthly search advertising services, and monthly optimization and management.\nContract Balances\nTiming of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. The Company records a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing.\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs, which are included in cost of sales and general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of operations, are expensed when incurred. Total advertising expenses amounted to $13,729 and $0, during fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Included in these estimates are assumptions about the collection of its accounts receivable, converted amount of cash denominated in a foreign currency, and estimated amounts of cash, the derivative liability could settle, if not in common shares. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company follows the provisions of the ASC 740 -10 related to, Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions. When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. The Company believes its tax positions are all highly certain of being upheld upon examination. As such, the Company has not recorded a liability for uncertain tax benefits.\nThe Company has adopted ASC 740-10-25 Definition of Settlement, which provides guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered effectively settled, an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit, even if the tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations remains open.\nEarnings (loss) per common share\nThe Company utilizes the guidance per FASB Codification ASC 260 \"Earnings Per Share\". Basic earnings per share is calculated on the weighted effect of all common shares issued and outstanding and is calculated by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share, which is calculated by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares used in the basic earnings per share calculation, plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive securities outstanding, is not presented separately as it is anti- dilutive. Such securities have been excluded from the per share computations as of August 31, 2023 and 2022.\nDerivative Liabilities\nThe Company assessed the classification of its derivative financial instruments as of August 31, 2023, which consist of convertible instruments and rights to shares of the Companys common stock and determined that such derivatives meet the criteria for liability classification under ASC 815.\nASC 815 generally provides three criteria that, if met, require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free-standing derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument subject to the requirements of ASC 815. ASC 815 also provides an exception to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional, as described.\nDuring fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Company had notes payable outstanding in which the conversion rate was variable and undeterminable. Accordingly, the Company has recognized a derivative liability in connection with such instruments. The Company uses judgment in determining the fair value of derivative liabilities at the date of issuance at every balance sheet thereafter and in determining which valuation is most appropriate for the instrument (e.g., Binomial method), the expected volatility, the implied risk-free interest rate, as well as the expected dividend rate.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nEffective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted FASB ASC 820-Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820, for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC 820 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to existing generally accepted accounting principles that require the use of fair value measurements establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements. The adoption of ASC 820 did not have an impact on the Companys financial position or operating results but did expand certain disclosures.\nASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below.\nLevel 1\nObservable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2\nObservable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\nLevel 3\nUnobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting entitys own assumptions.\nThe Company did not have any Level 2 or Level 3 assets or liabilities as of August 31, 2023, and 2022, with the exception of its derivative liability which are valued based on Level 3 inputs.\nCash is considered to be highly liquid and easily tradable as of August 31, 2023 and 2022 and therefore classified as Level 1 within our fair value hierarchy.\nIn addition, FASB ASC 825-10-25 Fair Value Option, or ASC 825-10-25, was effective January 1, 2008. ASC 825-10-25 expands opportunities to use fair value measurements in financial reporting and permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company did not elect the fair value options for any of its qualifying financial instruments.\nConvertible Instruments\nThe Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options embedded in its convertible instruments in accordance with professional standards for Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.\nProfessional standards generally provide three criteria that, if met, require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free-standing derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. Professional standards also provide an exception to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional as defined under professional standards as The Meaning of Conventional Convertible Debt Instrument.\nThe Company accounts for convertible instruments (when it has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments) in accordance with professional standards when Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features, as those professional standards pertain to Certain Convertible Instruments. Accordingly, the Company records, when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt to their earliest date of redemption. The Company also records when necessary deemed dividends for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in preferred shares based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note.\nASC 815-40 provides that, among other things, generally, if an event is not within the entitys control could or require net cash settlement, then the contract shall be classified as an asset or a liability.\nStock Based Compensation\nWe account for the grant of stock options and restricted stock awards in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. ASC 718 requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation.\nForeign Currency Translation\nAssets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating in foreign countries are translated into U.S. dollars using either the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date or historical rate, as applicable. Results of operations are translated using the average exchange rates prevailing throughout the year. The effects of exchange rate fluctuations on translating foreign currency assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars are included in a separate component of stockholders equity (accumulated other comprehensive loss), while gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in operations.\nBusiness Combinations\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 805, \"Business Combinations\" (\"ASC 805\") the Company records acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting, under which the acquisition purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values. The Company utilizes management estimates and, in some instances, may require an independent third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and contingent consideration granted. Such estimates and valuations require us to make significant assumptions, including projections of future events and operating performance.\nCustomer Concentration\nFour and three of the Company's customers accounted for approximately 94% and 94% of its revenues during fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nManagement does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nNOTE 4 - PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nProperty and equipment consisted of the following:\nEstimated Life\nComputer and office equipment\n3 to 5 years\n$ 23,920\n$ 23,920\nLess: Accumulated depreciation\n(23,920\n)\n(22,500\n)\n$ -\n$ 1,420\nDepreciation expense amounted to $1,420 and $0 during fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nNOTE 5 - LOANS PAYABLE\nAugust 31,\nLoans payable\n$ 2,505,588\n$ 1,979,431\nThe loans payables are generally due on demand and have not been called, are unsecured, and are bearing interest at a range of 0-12%., with the exception of one loan payable to a financial institution. Such loan, which amounted to $34,302 at August 31, 2023 bears interest at 2.5%, is unsecured, matures in November 2027 with principal and interest payable monthly starting in November 2022. This loan is part of a Bounce Back Loan Scheme from the UK Government.\nThe company may have to provide alternative consideration (which may be in cash, fixed number of shares or other financial instruments) up to amounts accrued to satisfy its fixed obligations under certain unsecured loans payable. The consideration hasnt been issued yet and is included in accrued expenses and interest expense and was valued based on the fair value of the consideration at issuance.\nThe aggregate schedule maturities of the Companys loans payable outstanding as of August 31, 2023 are as follows:\nYear ended August 31,\n$ 2,478,291\n11,948\n12,708\n2,641\n$ 2,505,588\nNOTE 6 - CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES\nAt August 31, 2023, and August 31, 2022 convertible debentures consisted of the following:\nAugust 31,\nConvertible notes payable\n$ 517,242\n$ 546,571\nThe convertible debentures matured in 2015, and bear interest at ranges between 6% and 15%.
